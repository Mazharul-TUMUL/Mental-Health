"rescue meds I've been on an episode all week. I don't want to increase my APs because they generally work and I don't have a bunch of side effects. Question: is there a 'rescue' pill that my pdoc could prescribe me for when my symptoms rise above my regular dosage? I'm two months into a new job and I don't want to start down the path of burning up all of my sick leave and vacation on my schizoaffective disorder and lose this job too. I like this job and for the most part, it seems to be working.

I'm on Abilify, Klonapin PRN, and Prozac. Klonapin helps with the anxiety/panic but doesn't do a thing for the psychotic symptoms.",Schizophernia

"My dad had delusions. Hi people of Reddit, I wanted to hear your input on something that hasn't left my mind ever since it happened. Awhile back my dad experienced his first schizophrenic symptoms. He had delusions about everyone thinking he was gay. To my mom he described it as a fear ""because everyone is talking about him being gay"". I was wondering if these delusions represent anything at all , is there some psychological trigger to it or just purely and simply delusions?",Schizophernia
"Dealing with other people... I wanted to make a short post about being an introverted, agoraphobic schizophrenic with CPTSD, but there is honestly so much going on in my life and I don't know who to talk to about any of it.

I'm 28 and unemployed at the moment, partly because I was physically sick for many years (I'm not anymore, but my body is still very weak in the aftermath) and partly because I am scared to rejoin the workforce because I am uneducated, physically weak and mentally ill.  I can't handle being part of a social circle or interacting with the same people on a daily basis unless they are close friends or family.  Inevitably, when I worked at jobs where I had to interact with people daily, I would have anxiety attacks, panic attacks and/or psychotic episodes at work.  I was best as a cashier because, for whatever reason, dealing with customers was way different than dealing with the same co-workers daily and I was mostly isolated from my co-workers.  However, after several years of gastrointestinal illness, I highly doubt I have the stamina to maintain a job that requires me to be on my feet all day.

My dad is also schizophrenic and he worked from home during some of his most difficult years.  He made very little money, but he survived and he's leveled out as he got older and can now work an office job, though only about 4 days out of the week.  My 31-year-old sister, who is also schizophrenic with CPTSD, is on disability and gets less than enough to get by and is constantly stressing over money, causing her to have increased psychotic episodes.

I want to enroll in community college and try to find a career that allows me to be isolated and/or doesn't require me to work full-time.  I realize that that's what a lot of people want, and it doesn't feel realistic, but I want to contribute to my household somehow...

Working, introverted schizophrenics, how do you deal with interacting with your co-workers?  What careers might allow me to limit my interactions with other people?  I know that in another post, people suggested work with computers.  What did y'all study in school?  I appreciate any input at all.",Schizophernia
"Early Symptoms for Paranoid Schizophrenia? Hello,   
I am just writing this post because I am pretty sure I am experiencing the early onset symptoms of Paranoid Schizophrenia, but I am not entirely sure. I am looking for a therapist anyway, but due to my family history, and my past behaviors in the last three years, I feel like the subtle signs seem to be pointing more towards said mental illness.  

I don't experience visual or auditory hallucinations but from the tedious research I have done, there are subtle symptoms that I relate to, but I want to find out more so that I have a better understanding of myself and I know what to expect.   

I understand the early symptoms of Schizophrenia in general, but I can't find any early symptoms to those who specifically suffer from Paranoid Schizophrenia. My mother has it, but her first real experience and introduction to her illness was a full blown, in your face, visual hallucination. I am not entirely sure if there were events in her life that she di not think twice of, but should have.  


So basically what I am looking for is:  


Is there a distinction between Schizophrenia and Paranoid Schizophrenia? If so, then what were the early symptoms you experienced? Were there any symptoms that you often experienced but you overlooked?   

Apologies if this is a repetitive answer. Please downvote, if it is.

"Dealing with schizophrenia by becoming and alcoholic  I'm struggling with alcoholism. I want to get better but can't seem to find anything that has worked.. My next try is going to be a writing in a journal for each day that has a scale that will show how drunk i was and a scale for how I emotionally felt that day. I think I have schizophrenia because sometimes I hear voices but also think that other people can hear my thoughts and drinking is the only thing that helps get rid of that panic/ anxiety feeling that comes with hearing the voices. They're not always bad thoughts so its not invasive or upsetting but they stop me from being the person i want to be. this started like in gr 10 and im now 24 and i dont want to try to take medication. i have dramatically changed from the panic and anxious feeling where i can now tell myself that no one can hear me, but i also want to get off of drinking now, and i want to know what worked for you guys ",Schizophernia
"Has anyone here experienced this set of delusions before?    About a year ago, I was diagnosed with a psychosis spectrum disorder due to unusual behavior. My doctor said I had little disorganized or negative symptoms, but I had delusions. 

I wanted to be hyper focused on doing the right thing all the time, including being honest with others, and other things. During this period I had trouble paying attention because I believed as long as I thought these thoughts all the time (such as ""Do the right thing"" or ""Be honest""), I would in turn act to do the right thing or be honest, and paying attention to anything else wasn't necessary.

"Anxious/Scared I'm in prodromal phase of schizophrenia? Hello r/schizophrenia, I hope you're all doing well and that the subject matter of my post is not alarming.

I have come to the subreddit to explain how I'm feeling, and how worried I am. I basically think I'm entering the prodromal phase of schizophrenia, and I'm extremely scared.

I've not heard voices, I've not hallucinated, and I'm not deluded - I don't think the government's out to get me or that people can read my thoughts, but I'm scared that other parts of me are becoming affected. I've become really tired and lethargic in recent weeks, I'm not eating much, I've noticed that while I'm still laughing, I'm nowhere near as happy with doing things as I was before. 

The two concerning symptoms I have is my memory and a general brain fog. I used to have an amazing memory - I could remember stuff out of the blue and would hardly ever forget ANYTHING, much less simple stuff like I am now. I'm not forgetting to grab things when I need them, like if I'm going out, and I'm not forgetting things like my birthday or other important dates. I'm just feeling generally forgetful. In addition, I am also having problems with speaking coherently - I'm not jumbling them up word salad style or going off on freaky, unrelated tangents, but I'm often having trouble keeping track of what I'm saying - I'm losing focus when speaking, if you will, which I can recognise and correct. 

I am not having focus issues when reading, I am not being clumsy, I am not suspicious or paranoid of other people, I'm not neglecting friends, family, my hygiene or responsibilities, but I feel like I'm constantly on the lookout for any potential symptom of schizophrenia that I can find. And I want to know why I am constantly doing this.

If this information helps, I am 19 years old, Male, diagnosed with Asperger Syndrome but no other mental health condition, I have a distant relative (great aunt's son) who is a diagnosed schizophrenic, and I have recently quit a 15 month cannabis habit (not daily but some periods of daily use followed by 1-3 day breaks in between. This 15 months began October 2017, shortly after I turned 18 and finished on the 7th January. I never used more than around a gram to two grams a day during this habit, and occasionally I used less than a gram. I have quit for 12 days as of this post.). None of these symptoms were present before I smoked, or during, only after. I think these symptoms are to do with weed withdrawals sending my anxiety into a tailspin, but I'm honestly not so sure at this point.

Is anyone able to provide me with any reassurance that I am not going, or even possibly going, schizophrenic? I am seriously worried about developing it and the consequences of it as such, so any advice is widely welcomed. Thank you so much for reading and understanding :) ",Schizophernia
"New to the sub - saying hi and a thought on L-Theanine for any curious Hi all. I have schizoaffective disorder and have had it for roughly the past 20 years. I've tried online forums and message boards in the past, but they tend to be a little too overwhelming, so I'm trying this sub.

You can call me Vic for short, if you like. I'm almost 40 and still learning how to cope with positive and negative symptoms.

I chose to go the route of not pursuing a love life, and have not dated in almost 10 years. I have very little interest in dating, because most women view my family as a threat instead of as my support system. I am male, in case you're curious (Probably not, but I figured I'd tell you that anyway)

I am on day 2 of cutting out my normal 200mg of L-Theanine per day. I slept a lot better last night, had less vivid dreams/no nightmares for the first time in several months, and today I have way more energy considering I've only drank about half the regular amount of coffee I drink by now.

I heard sarcosine is the supplement that really helps sza, but I'm hesitant to try any more supplements. I'm good on what I take, I think.

Speaking of, you might be curious which meds I take. I take paliperidone and started on it around the beginning of 2018. It's been a life changer for me, because previously I was on risperidone and before that, olanzipine. Neither really worked very well for me, not to the point this one does.

Unfortunately, I am the sza person that has never gotten it completely together. I still cannot work full time, and any extreme stress, even stress from a contractor not calling back about work on my house, causes me to have extreme auditory symptoms for several days at a time.

I learned to cope by talking to my voices when they're super loud, because they usually have something they want me to know. I only started doing this after reading Louise Haye's books and telling myself positive affirmations for about a year or so.

This is me in a nutshell. I don't get too personal, but I wanted to give you some background on me, because why should you want to talk to me otherwise? Also, don't expect a selfie from me.

"How do I hide my negative symptoms? I don't want people to know I have schizophrenia but (especially) if I'm not telling them, they're shaming me for being lazy, being self-absorbed, not being present, not caring about anything, and so forth. They perceive me as the worst person ever because I don't have a degree and I don't have a job and I don't have hobbies and I seem not interested in the conversation. It's hard to get me talking. I have a lot of scary thoughts and I can't get rid of them, and sometimes I just can't talk about anything but my scary thoughts. Other times I just don't know what to say, like, at all.
I realize I need people who would love me and help me with my life. I hate myself for being so low functioning. I've had acquaintances with schizophrenia and I couldn't see any difference between them and healthy people. But my schizophrenia is clearly visible. When I try to hold a conversation, people see there's something really wrong with me.
I feel so desperate because I can't do anything about my life. I don't even know who I am. I'm just schizophrenia itself. Nothing more. I'm not human. I can't even name one personality trait of mine. If you can, please let me know. It'd be helpful if someone found something human in me, just like if you were me and tried to tell about yourself.
Is there a way to make negative symptoms seem as good or neutral personality traits of a mentally healthy person? Please, say there is and tell me what they are. We can try to talk if me being super passive, is okay with you.
Who I live with, they tend to gaslight me all the time, so I really need someone to do a sanity check. But it means I have to trust this person. But there's a problem. I don't know how to know if someone is trustworthy or not. I used to trust people who ended up doing awful things to me. Now I'm just socially isolated. But I try to socialize again and find someone to protect me, so I feel more secure.
There's something I can't verbalize but it's constantly inside my head. I feel like I must control myself (in a helpful way), like I must take on the role of my own mom (my real mom is dead), like I must take responsibilities I can't take. I don't trust myself, but there should be someone I could trust, and I try to imitate this person. Get it? I'm not sure I explained it good enough, although I've been writing this post for a week or so. I really need to fix my life but I don't know how. Like I need someone to control me because I don't trust myself but I don't want them to control me because if someone wants to control me, they'll abuse me. Everything is so contradictory about me. I'm constantly trying to sort it all out but failing.",Schizophernia

"Just picked up my brother and what followed was a nightmare. My brother has been having problems for years and we didn at know it was schizophrenia. My mom has been at the end of her wits. I ave always been gone. 

Today she called him and we quickly left to go get him from his new appt in a new town where he was working a relatively new job. 

We found him at the end of a road near his appt (in a rural community) passed out drunk in his car. 

The drive back to my mothers (about an hour) was the longest of my life and very disturbing.  He was out of his mind and speaking complete nonsense, most of it paranoid thoughts about the government and the people who had wronged him throughout his life. Eventually he admitted to multiple personalities, and they continued to fly about the conversation. 

When we got home he stomped about for hours cycling through all of his paranoid thoughts (he as been drunk for about a week and lost his job) until we gave him a sleeping pill and he finally went to bed.  What my mom and I witnessed tonight was more than I have ever seen in movies, and could be compared to the exorcism. It was really fucked up and I feel bad for my mom for having to witness it. It was deeply disturbing and we are very scared for his well-being.

He has been on sertraline and represidone at various times...(I am very sorry I don at know the correct spellings) and said tonight he ad love to go back on represidone. BUT he always comes off his meds and resorts to weed or cbd oil which he claims does wonders for him.

"schizophrenia is sexual repression when you live in the present I think it's important to acknowledge that schizophrenia is caused by sexual repression, that's at least one of the reasons, it's a symptom of not being able to fuck all the time because life is calculating act and if you are experiencing schizophrenic symptoms it is likely that your act has taken on words repressed in your mind. Language is all a sexual act. You are trying to escape reality because act isn't perfect. Are you that lit is an attention. Sexual repression causes idiot savants. A genius act will suffer levels.

"Does this sound like the onset of schizophrenia? So about six months ago I was in a heavy depressive state and decided to take some LSD to see what it'd do, and lo and behold it more or less lifted the depressive state immediately and then a month or so latter I decided to do it again simply because of how euphoric the experience had been, and then done it again two weeks later at a lower dose(my previous ones were quite high), during this experience I got into a disturbing conversation with a friend (of a conspiratorial and occult nature, stuff I've been interested in for a while) which left me very uneasy, a day or so later I more or less suddenly started having startling peripheral hallucinations, mostly just dark blurs moving towards me rapidly, at which point I was convinced there were demons in my home, I covered the whole place with salt and retreated to my bed for a day or two.   
I recovered more or less from this within a few days, but I've been having minor auditory and visual hallucinations since then, hearing my name being called when nobody is around, hearing my flatmate move around when it turns out he's at work, occasionally vague shadowy figures in my periphery, small flashes of light at night when I'm trying to sleep and occasionally insects. I'm also just generally getting startled by things more, my perception being suppressed and then rapidly flaring up making me aware of my surroundings.  


I've also had semi-delusional experiences, attempting to control people or animals (while being semi-self-aware that it probably wouldn't work), and I'm somewhat suspicious that the government is watching me (not continual surveillance but maybe occasional checkups) because of my somewhat radical political views. I'm generally getting slightly paranoid about certain friends I have, nothing specific just general disloyalty.  


My memory has never been great, but it also seems to be slipping, things just generally seem to be getting harder to manage in my life, I've always been socially anxious but now it seems hard to get more than a few words out. During the last 4 months since I did LSD I've done amphetamine twice, simply to break the unbearable boredom I've been feeling (it works pretty well), but one the second time I did it I got shadow people that didn't disappear when I turned to look at them within just a couple hours of taking it, which has put me off that.   


I've been telling myself that this is simply HPPD, but most stuff I've found seems to suggest that tends to get better over time, not worse. I really don't want to waste the valuable time of a psychiatrist if this is just HPPD that will resolve itself, and honestly I seem far too self-aware for this to be actual schizophrenia, every report I've seen of schizophrenics having an episode are other people telling them they're suffering from delusions or issues.

Usually I would say I have a pretty wide range of emotions and a pretty extreme temper unfortunately.
I am also still pretty good at forming friendships and often told that I am good socially (I just can at maintain the fucking stuff cause I get scared of abandonment or paranoid about ill intentions)
It has gotten way worse though, I barely even try to maintain social relations, even though people try to reach out I just kind of don at respond. It just seems pointless.
I have one close relationship that I keep working to maintain with my ex-boyfriend. I want to push him away too but I also want to keep the last slightly stable thing in my life.
When I push him away with psychotic, self-harming or extremely angry actions I crawl back and apologize while I would just ghost other people. He never understands in the moments when it happens but he understands and forgives in retro perspective when I explain.

I am getting better at reacting with sadness instead of rage, since he/most people understands it better and I think it doesn at push him/them away as much.


Also guys, I am fucking losing myself
I used to be this relatively pretty girl, even found myself attractive sometimes, doing great socially and in school, extroverted, lots of friends, somewhat happy (sucky childhood, so always struggled a bit) but very outgoing and pretty funny. 

Gradually over the last years all of that has just declined.
I just get weirder and weirder (in a bad way), more psychotic, self hatred, self harming, I can at stand to look at pics of myself unless I edit them to make it look like how I feel like I used to look, even though in reality I probably haven at changed.
The only reason I look in a mirror is to do make up so I can bear to go out in public and not feel like everyone is staring at my flaws.
I spend all of my money to fix the stuff I hate about myself (photo editing apps, makeup, skincare)
I can at hold a job anymore. I dropped out of school a few times as well. 
I just want to die. Or be myself again. I want to just feel pretty and happy for a day.
I want to trust someone, something or myself again.
I want to do well at something.
I don at want a lifelong struggle.
I want a relationship and stable friendships.
I want anything but this.",Schizophernia

"How do I explain this ( I feel like I've been in a coma since I was eight and want to tell my boyfriend.)

Ever since I was a young girl I've felt as though I'm not technically alive, but trapped deep in a coma. Everyone I've met so far in my life doesn't seem like an actual person to me anymore and is more of a representation of things that I went through when I was ""awake."" 

The only person this doesn't apply to is my boyfriend, and it's only because I can feel his heartbeat whenever I embrace him. I've come up with the theory that he's in the same hospital room as I am and has taken intrest in me. He holds my hands against his chest so I can feel his heart and talks to me while I sleep, which would explain why I enjoy holding him so much.

He's the only person who's ""real"" to me at the moment, minus my family, and I want to tell him this. Maybe he can snap me out of this delusion, or at least understand my struggles a bit more. ",Schizophernia

"Schizoaffective disorder diagnosis So I got my diagnosis a few years back after my first and only episode at this point. My family firmly believes my psychosis was the result of various drugs: Xanax, dxm, pot, alcohol, opiates, and Ambien. Note these drugs were hardly combined and if they were it was pot in addition to another. Dxm was a one time thing. My recollection leads me to believe that the hallucinations started very subtle and gradually grew to the point of psychosis in about the span off 2 weeks at which point I self committed to an inpatient mental health facility. They had to keep me sedated with several shots of haldol a day for the first half of my stay (12 days) to keep me manageable and started me on 4mg of risperidone. I am officially off all mental health medications but feel like I might need to ask for an antidepressant on my next check up visit.

"I can't stop stalking my therapist I posted about this situation a while ago but its developed into a new issue. It's totally a fucked up set of circumstances in every way.

I (23F) went to a licensed psychotherapist (32M) who does shamanic ceremony and breathwork outside of his practice. It's not a part of his actual practice but there are talk therapy parts of those processes. I started as a formal client but he recommended the breathwork. He is licensed and I checked, no disciplinary action or complaints. There were a few issues - obvious attraction on my end, and I think maybe his but it's hard to know, that was not addressed. The sessions were done in his home. He knew I was a survivor of childhood sexual abuse / incest but not the schiz. That's what I was there to process. During one of the sessions he initiated prolonged eye contact while I lay on my back and he pinned my arms down as a way to defuse my anxiety, had me do holotropic breathwork to bring me into a regressed state, and then tied me up with rope and touched me in a number of ways including squeezing my neck. I have heard from two other therapists and several other IRL people (including probably 40 people on Reddit) that he was so far in the wrong he should maybe even be reported. He didn't ask for consent before the bondage or strangling, later admitted to being into BDSM personally, and it turned out the rebirthing therapy we did is actually illegal in my state. 

But I felt like I ""fell in love"" with him then, pretty much from the time with the eye contact. He told me about his history -- he had suffered from OCD and bipolar, had an incestuous relationship with his mother, tried to kill his dad, used to stockpile assault rifles, stalked former girlfriends. But he had changed his life and put that all behind him; and honestly it only made him sexier and more exciting. And now he was a functioning professional with a lot of friends in a huge super nice house in the mountains! I couldn't believe how far he'd come. He seemed to know absolutely everything about the human psyche, about philosophy, and was also a higher-up ""guru"" type in a Brazilian ayahuasca religion in which he'd gone through a 10-year shamanic initiation. I started to think he was the one, and the ONLY ONE, who could understand me and help me with my issues. I became obsessed with him. My boyfriend was very concerned and has been telling me for probably 6 months that the guy is unwell. Intellectually I can see that that seems true. But the guy had told me so many times he has transcended his issues, he knows the way, he was so smart and nuanced in his thinking. I started to think everything he said was absolute gospel. He suggested very edgy therapies, like OCD treatments including tying up a germ freak and rubbing raw meat all over their body. For my OCD and neurotic reliance on my plans and schedules he suggested tying me up and burning my plan in front of me for our next session.

The guy believed that reliving the birthing process is the ONLY way to ultimately resolve psychological issues. But because my boyfriend and another friend confronted him about the consent issue, he decided to stop working with me. I held it together for a few months, but then started trying to coerce him. I told him if he didn't work with me again I would sue him and tell everyone about what he did. We hung out as friends a few more times but he was very worried about working with me again. On one of these occasions he told me he had been blackmailed before and if I continued or if it happened again he might kill himself. So when he tried to distance himself from me I called in a suicide threat to the police to his home on a day I knew he was having special time alone with his friends and there were a number of other people there, AND I knew he had a lot of drugs so it could have been catastrophic for him. He told the police I was harassing him and he was considering pressing charges. Then he called my boyfriend and said he had three lawyers and a journalist involved and they believed they had an extortion case against me and that if I didn't stop he would move forward. He called friends and told them to distance themselves from us because He would have to blow up our lives if I tried to blow up his. My lawyers believed he was full of shit because there's no way he could take me down because he has committed so many crimes here that are so much worse. He also offered to give me all sorts of exotic hallucinogens but didn't realize that I didn't want drugs! I just wanted to be around him so desperately.

Eventually, he politely asked me not to contact him again in any form and suggested that we move on with our lives. I was so crushed. I was able to respect that for about a week. I made a new Facebook (he blocked my real one) and used the graph search to view every post he ever commented on or liked. I joined every group he was a part of and searched for every private post he had ever made. I ""heart""ed all the posts he made about interesting things, but also ones about the best way to peel potatoes from nine years ago. Then I sent him messages. First apologies, then desperate pleas for him to finish helping me as a therapist, then naughty suggestive come-ons. It's been a week, and he still hasn't responded. I've started finding ways to hang out with his friends and am trying everything I can to get close to him socially. I know this is more OCD, and I know he can't help me as a therapist if he even wanted to. I know he probably shouldn't even be practicing. But I've made him into some sort of god after the age regression bondage and eye contact thing, and I feel like I will always be psychologically and spiritually shattered without him. 

Further complicating matters, my boyfriend owns a private school and is worried about scandal blowing up and ruining him. We also share a one-year-old child together and don't want things to affect him. I had a fellowship this semester that I had to drop out of because my anxiety and preoccupation with this got too bad, it's $12000 down the drain and a huge burnt bridge.

 I sought therapy truly seeking psychological support and self-improvement and his bad boundaries combined with mine to create such a horrible situation, I feel like I've deteriorated psychologically so much. I have two therapists involved now helping me untangle this but I feel literally addicted to this guy. Miserable and need help.",Schizophernia

The way I'm thinking is changing. I feel like I'm obtaining knowledge every waking &amp; sleeping moment. I'm more relaxed. I'm more confident.

Today. Text a friend & tell her I'll meet her after my  appointment. I was coming out of the building with the woman I'd just met in the group so we're making small talk. Just before we reach the door onto the street I see two girls sitting on the bench smiling and laughing at me. Out of nowhere the words ""what the fuck are you looking at?"" left my mouth. I stormed out only to turn around & approach the girls. But as I got closer I realised it was my friend who I'd said I'd meet & this other friend we know. I apologized but they were shaken by the experience. I felt like a horrible person. I've never had an outburst like that.

The three of us hang out for an hour or two. It's after 6 now & I'm walking up to the train station to go home. I usually go in the side gate so I don't have to pay through the barriers but the gate was locked. 7 minutes until the train was due. Two guys my age climbed over the gate. I walked behind the bike shed to suss out the fence. I found a part of the wall I could stand on & then hoisted myself over the metal bars and onto a large green recycling bin. One more section of fence & it was a small drop into the platform. I looked back & seen about 5 other young guys do the same thing. The train starts moving.

I'm walking towards the harbour. I come to an enclosed green area with a monument of an anchor in the middle & several benches. I sat down & rolled a J.

I smoked looking over the sea. I walked back through town and then through the woods towards my estate. I had a penknife in my pocket for protection. 

I smoked more at the burnt out bonfire in the other woods near my estate. I walked back towards town going straight past my house. I think that God has been sending me knowledge since I started going on these long walks. The more I walk the more things are revealed to me. 

I am causing change everywhere. I've trained one of my dogs who was biting the other dog for the last year. She was also very territorial over food & toys. The training was all instinct. I've worked on it for about 2 weeks now & she's a changed dog! I knew exactly how to train her without researching anything.

I haven't spoke to me grandmother much after my grandfather died 3 years ago. There is a lot of family problems. But I seen her when I was walking the other day and we chatted for half an hour & the conversation just flowed I haven't spoken to her in ages & our previous conversations were always arguments. I am changing things that have been the same for years! There is something going on I'm following divine intuition. 

There is a down side. As my thoughts grow I feel like more and more people are becoming attracted to me. I'm not talking in a sexual way but I've noticed people staring, smiling, finding it easy to talk to me. But it's making me uncomfortable because I like my solitude. I don't want people to become attached to me right now. I want to be in the background but I feel like people are starting to follow.

And when I'm walking. I hear footsteps, the sounds of breathing, the sounds of clothing. It gets louder. I turn around to face my attacker and the road is empty. It's happening multiple times. Who is following me & disappearing? And I think I see people everywhere and it always turns out to be a tree or a bench.

I've been taking my meds. I just want to know the truth about all of this. I can feel it. That this is special. Meaningful. Something is stirring out there. It's ready for you.

He speaks in wired ""rythem"" and sometimes it makes no sense to me. At dinner we were talking about something on the news and he said ""Yeah it is like when a cat jumps off a bride,but not the red kind the blue kind, with strings, man we have all changed just think of that"" 

He dosen't seem to have emotions correctly if that makes any sense like laughing at sad things or crying at funny things

So I am totally ignorant but I thought Schizophrenia meant like seeing shadow people, or being really paranoid? Also wouldn't all these pills he has been taking fix the problem? 

I just feel powerless not being able to understand this. His therapist said he can't diagnose him but something about ""Disorganized-Schitzophrenia"" if anyone out there has that do these symptoms sound familiar? 

I really just want answers and hopefully someone can help me, it upsets my son trying to talk about it.",Schizophernia
"1995 I was first diagnosed in 1995 with drug induced schizopheniform psychosis that was supposed to go away after a few weeks.

Here I am 24 years later have gone through a schizophrenia diagnosis before settling on schizoaffective 20 years ago.

"Should I try and see someone? First off I know that nobody can diagnose anyone without being seen and seeing my health records, ect.

I feel like I've been experiencing psychotic symptoms for a while but am unsure if they are just normal experiences I am misinterpreting.

It started a couple years ago and I've never thought anything of it, but sometimes it feels like I hear someone inside my head talking but not answering back to me.  It tells me to do some stuff I'm obviously not okay with.  Example someone does something mildly irritating and it wants me to stab them in front of everyone and I get very vivid thoughts of me doing it and blood running down my hands in the future.  Starting my roommates bed on fire while he sleeps, ect.  I obviously don't react on anything because they aren't normal thought but in the moments I feel compelled to.

Sometimes colors shift in my eyes to lighter or darker shades and I feel in tune with the universe and get signs that tell me that I'm where I'm supposed to be.  I see patterns that match, listen to something and see an object talked about in the song, or even when I'm working out doing pullups I feel like I can somewhat communicate with the universe and it tells me how many I can do back to me so when I feel like I'm struggling at a point I always know I have more in myself to push more.

I always thought like the sounds and voices I hear were normal like dialogue with myself or just buzzing and stuff, but last night it felt different.  As I was sitting there I kept ""hearing"" a voice saying ""stop look, look"" and it wouldn't stop for what felt like a lengthy period of time and I didn't know what I'm supposed to be looking for.

I guess there's other stuff that concerns me but that's probably the biggest things and i don't know if I should go see someone about these things or not.  I don't want to waste anyones time when there is nothing wrong and everything is fine and dandy.",Schizophernia
"I went to the career fair today I was diagnosed with schizophrenia my senior year of college. I had a psychotic break where my darkest nightmares turned into reality. I was in a psychiatric center when I watched myself be a spectacle for a live audience on television. My friends and hospital workers together drove me to insanity so that I could perform on TV. It was a devious plan that started when I was a mere child.  Lets trick him into thinking he understands reality and the world around him. Lets train him. Lets make him our ticket to the top. 

I've been on olanzapine, abilify, and now I'm finally on Geodon which has made my delusions seem silly mostly. I still have bouts of depression and sometimes the voices in my head get annoying. I thought it was normal to have voices. Now I've realized that my brain doesn't make a noise when its working efficiently. There's a beauty in being focused in an activity so that my brain doesn't have the time to question itself. I guess that's what this post has turned into at this point. That's what it all is really. That's my recovery. Stringing together seconds, minutes, maybe an hour of silence. The medicine is so vital and I'm so happy to live in a time when its accessible.

"psychosis vs guilt? i had an appointment today where they were trying to assess me for psychosis. i dont think the person assessing me believed what i was saying as she was very dismissive, but i don't know what to believe anymore. i tried to tell her about some of my odd beliefs/delusions and about how i see signs everywhere but in response she told me ""it sounds like you're using this as escapism for guilt"". it's true that something in my past has made me very guilty and affected me greatly and that my symptoms were much worse after it, but is it really possible that i'm just using delusions and paranoia as escapism? i really believe in them, and i daydream often but about entirely different subjects, and i know they're just daydreams. is it possible that i just made up my symptoms out of guilt? is this something that's recognised by the medical community?   
i didn't have very good ties to reality before but this doubt is tearing me apart; it feels like the small piece of reality i thought i knew for sure has been blown to pieces. i don't know if she was just being dismissive or if it's the truth and i didn't experience anything i thought i did. she didn't really ask me about paranoia or anything, either, she just kept poking at my guilt, which i didn't want to talk about at all. i feel completely unheard but at the same time i feel very worried that i just made all of it up/was unintentionally malingering, and i don't know what to do. sorry if this is hard to understand or if its offensive to anyone.

"What is wrong with me? I have very strong delusions, I am aware that these are delusions. But for some reason my brain begs to differ. 

For example, there is this a girl, whom is a complete stranger, I believe she throws signs that she is in love with me. I think to myself this is absolutely ridiculous, but I believe them. She never talked to me ever, but I think to myself she is shy and doesn at want to talk to me because she is in love. Yes, this is what I think. This isn at the first time this has happened either, there are other examples but I am too embarrassed to talk about them.

I am not diagnosed schizophrenic, but these delusions are so concerning to me that I should get this checked out by a professional. What as next? Thinking the government is after me as well? I feel like it as getting worse too, every time I wake up I hallucinate. Just yesterday I woke up and I saw my dog jump on my bed, touched him and he disappeared. 

I feel the delusions are getting stronger, I am becoming more obsessed and irritated that she does not talk to me. When she shouldn at have to me because why the fuck would she want to talk to a complete stranger? I am diagnosed GAD and depression so I currently take antidepressants. However is my medication making my delusions worse? I take Celexa 20mg. I am starting to believe perhaps I need to be put on antipsychotics.

"Just passing through with a question about ADHD meds and schizophrenia. Hey everybody. I've found myself at an impasse with my daughter's pediatrician, and I'm extremely frustrated. My husband's family has a history of schizophrenia and our 11 year old daughter has been diagnosed with ADHD. Our pediatrician has decided that no matter how bad the ADHD gets, she will not prescribe medication because she is concerned that it may increase the likelihood of her developing schizophrenia as an adult. Well, the ADHD is crippling some aspects of her ability to function. Now, we are very fond of our pediatrician, and she has really gone to bat for us with other things before, but I can't shake the feeling that it's less that there actually is an increased risk, with observable data to support the claim, and more that because for some people the side effects of ADHD meds mimic some symptoms of schizophrenia, it spooks her and she's not even willing to consider it. I've been trying to call local pediatric psychiatrists just to pose that question so hopefully I can get them in touch with the pediatrician, but so far, none have called me back. So if anyone here actually knows, is there an increased risk of developing schizophrenia if ADHD meds are taken as an adolescent, and I'm spinning my wheels for no reason because the doc is right? Or is there no increased risk and I need to keep fighting the good fight to get my girl some meds? I hope anybody reading this is having a good day.  Thanks for your time.",Schizophernia

"My story I'm thankful I finally decided to go back to Reddit and find such a great group.

I'm kinda scared to share my story but I'm going to to try to help myself and maybe others may get help out of it... probably not but what the hell:

I've been dealing with voices since I went to bonnaroo in 2006 I thought I was in a game show to find my true love and ended up losing my shoes and wandered every night by was there searching for clues picking up trash sorting bad from good trash trying to get to stages over night I'm sure I looked like some drugged up goof ball
The psychosis lasted well after I got back home for a couple of weeks. My friends didn't know what to do and never took me to a hospital. And I kept this a secret to everyone until a couple years ago... I thought I had a gift...

Years pass and in 2013 rolled around I'm at a tiny little outdoor gathering  in ohio again for a week all the sudden the dissociation and psychosis started again this time I decided to stay extended at the camp site and in fact I never went back to ny I called a friend and him and his girlfriend took me in. The psychosis faded yet again until I went back to the campsite the year after it this time I ended up on a greyhound bus got off at my destinations after being haunted my voices and delusions telling me to drop off my luggage and get back on the bus. The fucked up part is the bus driver didn't check to see if I had a ticket and just let me on. He finally kicked me off in some part of Florida I still have no idea where I was. I kept trying to find my friends to have them give me a ride and trying to get back on a bus. I managed to get a hold of a friend who wired me the money to get back home but I had no phone  because i dropped that behind due to the voices telling me to do so and couldn't get in touch with her when I landed so I had someone call the cops I told them I was hearing shit and he took me to a clinic... I stayed for a few days where I got to collect myself to ""normal"" and got a hold of my friend who picked me up but kicked me out a couple weeks later for putting her through hell waiting for me.

Then I move back to Ohio met a girl she breaks my heart I move to Kent and met someone who told me she couldn't get pregnant... then I get her pregnant.  She didn't help things by saying things like she wanted him to have the same last name as her and me finding fertility clinic info on her emails so I thought she was trying to trick me. Psychosis started again and I'm at my job the voices got to me and my body litteraly failed. I walked to a clinic it wasn't open I called they had the sheriff's drive me to the open one the clinic was a joke and didn't help me at all. I finally called my mother in my she was worried and ended up coming all the way down to see me in the clinic then I asked her to take me home. I thought the girl I got pregnant was lying and a fbi agent I ended up destroying my phone and moved my stuff to my.

Weeks later in my I had a fight with my mom and her and my sister told the l8cal mental health clinic and I got taken away to a hospital. I finally gave up I told them what I was hearing and what I was doing and I was finally diagnosed with schizophrenia. 2 years now I'm on invega depakote welbutrin and lexapro. I got back a hold of my girlfriend and after a year I finally was trusted to meet my son which I now watch full time at her house.

Read some posts here where ppl talk about in the beginning feeling like they were gifted in some way, feeling like they could read other people as body languages, like they connected telepathically with others. And that is how I feel sometimes. I just thought I was very sensitive and perceptive, and that I was able to connect with others in a deep way, but now it is scaring me. Some other possible symptoms I ave experienced are the misinterpretation of noises from where I am at. Never heard clear words. 

I took acid 5 times with bad vibes emerging quite normally during 2 of those, mdma arround 15 times with some anxious moments and I am a daily weed smoker for the last 2 years. Always have been anxious but the paranoia started to get worse on days where I smoke more weed than I should.

The thing is: I don at want to quit, I rely on weed to work on my art, I make photographs and abstract drawings, study those almost everyday and feel able to to perform my best while high. Some strains do not make me feel paranoid or anxious (all are high on THC tho bc my country hasn at legalized weed), and usually I just take some puffs, not smoking the whole joint, so I thought it might be fine.

"Is there any potential downside at all to discussing symptoms with a therapist or doctor? If a person, hypothetically, experienced symptoms of schizophrenia and wanted to discuss them with a professional, is there any chance (however minute) of this coming back to bite them?

Let as say, if the person in question worked for a company, and the company is now involved in a lawsuit of some kind, and the patient works in a relevant department.

why should there be cars at all? & for what matter

the stars, the roads, the fact of coffee

she wants to weep. to smash her head

upon the pavement for it is too much.

there, why is she filled with dread?

why does she know the evil 

that as within it? a moment later 

she is bored of her own death, having

witnessed it a thousand times, having

been assured it will take place

a little while on. she takes her pills.

in a small moment of clarity she wonders

how will she live? when she cannot

fathom what an orange is.

that as how it always starts. a day. 

a few weeks. a couple months

where everything is just so strange. 

what kind of thing as a shirt? does wood

exist? then, people follow her. the man

in the red pickup plans to slaughter her,

murder her family. she sees the future

in great detail. watches as her neck

is split open, blood pours out & down

her throat. will she drown in her own 

blood, or will she die of blood loss

first? she takes down his license plate. 

she checks her car for trackers. 

takes the long way home.

pulls into the wrong driveway. waits

a while till they must be gone

& then drives on until another car

can catch her eye. another person

to avoid. it takes forever to get home

this way. she glances in the rearview mirror

& beholds what she has known

is always there the demon, which begins

to scream. its contorted face & open

mouth beholds her back. she pulls over and waits

for it to stop. she as late for work.

she as late for life. she texts a friend

that she as not safe. she needs to go

home, but she cannot drive right now. 

it takes two hours in the starbucks 

parking lot. eventually the fear subsides.

she drives home slow. hides beneath

her desk the next three days. not

returning calls or texts or anything. 

she quits her job before they can fire her. 

they hate her. she hates them. if she had 

returned, they would have killed her. 

something stops. she stares a while at the wall. 

until she cannot breathe. the shadow people 

climb on her. beat her with ethereal fists

she thrashes violently around the bed 

till something snaps. she as outside 

her body & she sees herself. the vision burns. 

loses consciousness. it will be weeks, 

at least, until she feels sane enough

to leave the house. takes her seven pills

The hair on my neck raises at every shadow, and my ears feel tucked back and tight (I can wiggle my ears and they tend to do their own thing sometimes).

 It doesn't happen as often anymore, but sometimes I can look at something harmless (my beautiful dogs) but it's like there's something terrifying to their faces. Like they want to kill me.

"Things that helped me through my Psychosis. Hi all, I'd thought I'd provide a list of things that were most helpful to me during my psychosis. Please feel free to add any of your own helpful tips/activities. 

Meditation:
Would be very helpful to me. Especially in reducing the physical symptoms of my psychosis (rapid heart rate, sweating). It almost ended my psychosis. Sometimes 'the darkness' would overcome me though and I'd end up deeper in a delusion, so while I'd suggest it, I'd also add to be cautious and know when to quit a session that isn't going well.

Walking (Outside):
Seeing nature would help me a lot. I would always have to change locations though since they were pretty quickly engulfed in 'darkness' and trigger points for voices. 

Talking to strangers:
Talking to strangers (as opposed to family) helped me compose myself somewhat. This would work best during moments of insight. Talking kind of forced my mind off my delusions, it distracted me. The more and longer I could talk, the better. 

Pretending that I don't exist:
This one helped me to decentralize, something I consider quite useful in combating paranoia.By pretending that I didn't even exist, I could get a few moments of respite. No one was persecuting something that didn't exist.

Recording supportive messages to myself:
I would do this when my psychosis was in it's milder phases. I would record (on a tape player or phone) myself saying positive messages. Messages of hope that would potentially be sufficient to uplift me. Sometimes it worked, but mostly just made me feel better during the recording. 

Journaling: 
Once again, a distraction. Pretty much one of the only intellectual exercises (other than crosswords) that I could really engage in. I would just write and write about everything that was going on inside me, including various dialogues with voices.

Watching TV:
Would sometimes work, unless of course the TV was overcome with 'the darkness'. Sport is probably what I would recommend watching. I'd say to stay away from narrative content, lest your delusions morph and take on what you just watched (happened to me, not very fun).

Crossword Puzzles: 
This was something I used to do with my mum. It would make me feel better until a clue stood out as meaning more than it should. Delusions of reference central. 

Pacing (Inside):
This was a last resort tactic. Done in times of low insight, high voices. It would calm me to not have to sit still. Makes you look really crazy to other people though, but in those ultra-tense moments, who cares?

Medication: 
Ultimately what ended my psychosis. Without it I probably wouldn't be alive.

"I want to do something uncharacteristicly angry Idk what.

Every day I chill with my roommates, speaking when spoken to, never being confrontational or assertive, just chilling. Then when I'm by myself I can't stop myself from just wanting to scream and punch walls. Breaking the skin of my knuckles open is the only feeling I ever want to feel. And I just realized, my roommates have no idea. I want to tell them I'm only hanging on by a thread. I want to let them know I feel isolated and depressed. I want them to understand what goes on in my head, why I can't speak or date or party. They're good people. They would care. I think. There's just no way I could articulate it. And it makes me angry. So. Fucking. Angry.

So that's my dilemma. As I sit here typing this out, my roommates are all around me playing ping pong or Call of Duty, and all I want to do is shout, ""All of you, shut up and help me, cuz I'm drowning,"" but instead all I can do is just look up and get excited about my roommate's CoD killstreak. I want to do something uncharacteristicly angry, just so they know somethings wrong. Just so they look at me and see someone other than the easygoing guy that doesn't let anything faze him. I just don't know what....

I am sorry for ranting here. This sub is such an amazing, positive place, and I hate to ruin that vibe, but I needed to vent and I can't think of anywhere else people might understand.

"I'm on the verge of a panic attack This is going to sound really ramble but bare with me. 

The other day I went out drinking with a few friends since one of them just turned 21. I don't really like drinking but I like hanging out so I went. I watched carefully to make sure I wouldn't drink a lot. All I ended up having was one mixed drink and one shot. I made sure to drink lots of water and pace out my drinks over a couple hours. We were having a good time, we were playing truth or dare at a table and that is the last thing I remember.

The next thing I knew I woke up in a hospital. I nearly died of hypothermia and I had a ton of bruises everywhere.  Neither of my friends who found me in the hospital knew what happened to me and the only other person with me that night told me later that I just slipped on ice and couldn't get up but that is all they remember. 

Now the two things that don't make sense to me is that first if this person was with me when I slipped on ice, how come I had gotten hypothermia? It would have taken me a few hours to get that cold. Did they just leave me there instead of calling an ambulance. (And I live on a college campus so it wouldn't take more than 15 minutes for an ambulance to arrive, I know from experience). Also it doesn't make sense I slipped on ice because I have bruises and cuts on opposite sides of my body. Like bruises on my knees and hands (which means I fell forward) and bruises on my behind and sides (which means I fell backward). 

And ever since that incident I've been feeling extra paranoid that usual. I'm just about to have a panic attack while writing this. I'm worried that my boyfriend is sick of me and thinks badly of me and won't tell me. I try to tell him how i'm feeling but then I go into a thought loop that I'm just seeking attention and over exaggerating my problems.

"Cannabis bringing out schizophrenia-like symptoms. I really need some assurance here or advice at the moment because I have no family history of shizophrenia (although my dad has an undiagnosed hoarding problem, and my sister is consrantly in and out of doctors' offices for depression and anxiety). But a lot of time when I smoke cannabis, I get paranoid to the point where I think I am hallucinating but I am not sure if I am or not or just imagining it. I know this is very concerning, but I've asked on other places why this is happening but I keep getting told that I am just smoking strong weed.

I'll give you a couple examples of what I've experienced -

Last year when I first started using it, I went out of my house and halfway to my destination, I convinced myself that I had killed my mother in an argument before I went outside (when I didn't argue with her at all). I knew this was just delusion but it was so vivid in my head, that I went home to check on my mother to see if she was okay. I kept thinking ""Did this really happen?""  I was relieved to see if she was fine, but this was scary for me.

Second time is imagining stuff in my head, and it looks like they appear in front of me but at the same time, they don't. It's really confusing and I can't really explain it well. There was one after I smoked in my bedroom (it was really dark and the only light was coming from my laptop) and I ""saw"" my older brother in my corner of my eye. He had long, sharp razor teeth that covered the whole of his face, and said something in a demonic voice (I could best describe it as someone who is trying to talk while choking) and I can't remember what he said but I knew it wasn't real and there was no one there. After it was over, I kept questioning whether it really was a hallucination or if I was just being paranoid.

More recently, I was walking in the street (night again) and I walked past a bunch of parked cars in the housing estate I was in. In a jeep, I swear I could have seen two men sat in the front seats staring. As out of the ordinary this was, they were wearing all black and their faces were pure white and looked like potato faces. You know, like those children's dinners where they have smiley potatoes. It looked like them but I could barely see inside because the windows were all condensated. I imagine stuff like this unprovoked and get paranoid that they become a reality.

I keep thinking that there's nothing wrong with me sometimes but other times, I consider that I might be schizophrenic in the future. I'm 21.

So far, I plan to stop weed to see what happens or if this continues without it. But I don't want to go to the doctors only for them to laugh when I suggest schizophrenia when it might just be me over-thinking. But this sound like the symptoms to you?

"Family member to someone with schizophrenia unable to find compassion My older brother has schizophrenia and suffers from depression as well. Last year, he tried to commit suicide, but lived and is now disabled.

Since then, I have spent all of my time trying to understand how people can be understanding towards schizophrenia. I still cannot fathom how somebody could do the things he did to himself and to his family - it seems beyond selfish.

I understand that it is an illness, but there are many aspects of his outbursts that seem planned to hurt our family in the greatest possible way - when we finally have something to celebrate or be joyful about, that is when he does the craziest things.

Other than that, he is just incredibly lazy. For example, I have a younger sibling that is 16 years younger than him. My younger sibling does not cook or wash dishes for themself because they are only 12. Meanwhile, his 28 year old ass refuses to wash his dishes ""because if my younger sibling doesn't have to then why should he?"" 

It seems trivial, but imagine hundreds of more examples just like that and then trying to live with someone like that. He expects me and my parents to support and serve him for the rest of his adult life. No matter how hard I try, I just can't understand him.

He had everything afforded to him - incredible intelligence, financial support to do whatever he wanted, a family who loved him and tried to help him. He just threw it all away when he purposely disabled himself.

When I hear about people supporting their loved ones with schizophrenia, I wonder whether I am just a terrible person or whether they are just faking it. Either way, I just avoid my family completely because I can't deal with it.

I suppose I just want to hear whether people agree or disagree with me and what their reasoning is for it.  ",Schizophernia

If you are hearing voices like actually HEARING them audibly as if someone is talking to you then you are really rare and are some sort of a medium for entities who talk because you are the only person that can hear them.

Try and develop a mutual understanding and please don at believe that you are crazy. Labels from doctors are subjective diagnosis and mean nothing unless you accept it.

Don at think that your broken or diseased because you aren at. You are a rare soul who is able to tap into the spiritual realms which most people can at do.

"Minor victories. Hey, I just wanted to share some minor victories I achieved over the weekend. 

On Friday, my boiler pressure dropped and I couldn't work out how to top it up. I managed to call the maintenance team for my apartment building, who sent someone out to fix it. That's a HUGE deal for me - I don't like making phone calls, especially not ones asking for help, and letting strangers into my home is also a big deal. 

On Saturday it was my boyfriends birthday, so we went for a meal out with his friends, and then to a bar. I really struggle in big groups of people, especially ones I don't know well. I made it through the meal and a few hours in the bar - I did have to come home early, but he's a sweetheart and purposefully picked a bar a few minutes walk from my apartment so I could do that easily if I had to. 

Then on Sunday, I had a video call with my Step-Father. He lives a few thousand miles away, and although we've emailed and talked on messenger, we haven't spoken properly for about 7 or 8 years. It was great to have a catch up with him, and I enjoyed it so much we're making it a monthly thing, and I'm also arranging a video call with one of my friends in Australia too.

"Do you guys have to remind yourself time exists, and, do you experience the collapse of willed action like this? Hey,

I've been what I would consider depressed for  long time but none of the treatment or the way people described depression ever made proper sense to me. Doctors have never really cared when I describe these experience but the other day someone said I wasn't making any sense when I described how I have to deal with time. I looked up some papers about how schizophrenics and the experience of time. I read things about the negative symptoms of schizophrenia that made sense, so I was just wondering if I was reading it right and if people could relate to this.
Time

I forget that time exists and have no sense of identity. I put it down to depression and losing the want for things but now I have to actively create a person that is me, I have to write down who I am and what my identity is. I keep referencing it to remind myself of what my intentions are, that there are parts of me that stay static in time. I feel like I get lost away from who I am and end up confused unless I remind myself I'm a person and look at the text to remind myself what my core drives are.

Not the same as reminding myself of goals, but, in a much simpler sense. Reminding myself that I've chosen to exist, and that existence requires material action, and that positive and negative emotional states exist.

Will

I had this for a long time, but the inability to initiate action. Where you look down at your hands and you just can't move them. Like it's stuck at the millisecond before they move. I always thought this is what people called procrastination but I don't think that's what it is.

This morning I had it in bed, and it isn't like being tired and having to get up despite not wanting to. I couldn't create any positive thought to move my arms and legs. I have been deal with this more recently by imagining that I'm a puppet and imagine pulling a human soul in to the body, since a large part of why I'm around is to help my mother. Not you've got to do this but ""you have to bring in the human soul, you have to bring it in to this body. Get this body taking action and moving. Initiate action. I have to talk to myself in my head to kind of get it working - without the imagery and words it just doesn't move. I feel like I'm whispering to a brain and waiting to see the response, and over years I've found certain concepts or words that allow me to ""boot up"" and start forcing my body to move.

My mind still reacts to the environment but only really with avoidance and aversion. If I get shouted at it works after a while but abstract planning and will fails often. Apparently external stimuli and internal goals are different types of action according to one paper I read.

I have been very dysfunctional for about a decade. ( NEET, welfare ) It used to be worse and it's taken me many years by myself to try and get something working in my head since none of the advice ever worked, it always felt like there was something more simply wrong than what I kept being asked to do in therapy.

"Delusion. Trigger warning: Aliens, higher civilizations, suicide, abuse. Direct me to a different sub if I am wrong. So my problem is, I think aliens implanted a recording instrument inside my head, so they can collect data about an underdeveloped civilization like Earth.

Here are the reasons why I think this: 

1. I persistently think that hypergiant stars are populated and always try to keep my fictional universe as close as possible to real one. I spend way too much time in it. I think that my fictional universe, which is actually an edit of our real universe, may be a reality.
2. I don't feel a sense of responsibility for person, or a sense of self in general. I simply do not believe that a person called me exists, and I have never collected any evidence for this. My feelings, emotions, etc. were never really mine. Even as I am typing this, I visualize my fingers as in a movie and not actually being mine. I think there is a nanometer-sized instrument inside my head that is manipulating the body.
3. I always wanted to leave Earth since childhood and objectively insisted that aliens would come one day and take me away. 
4. I remember a moment from 2001, while my birth year is 2002. I once told my grandparents about a memory I had of setting up a large, old, blocky TV. I asked them, what year that was, and they answered, 2001. This was kinda a shock to me since to me memory was crystal clear of them being in the room. Except for some reason there was no me in the room. I have no idea what entity was observing that TV being set up.
5. I acted like a boy in childhood and up to a large age, but now I am a very dysphoric trans girl pursuing medical transition. I write this on a throwaway account. People already conflate being trans with schizophrenia so I better hide. I think aliens at the control center changed my brain gender, just so they can see what a terrestrial female would observe. I also have an intense fear of detransitioning, because they might switch me back to male.
6. Can also explain why I had suicidal thoughts. Aliens simply needed a way to extract back the instrument, after witnessing a lot of abuse on this planet and realizing that my assigned person is socially introverted and is not a good data collector. I have yet to commit suicide, but maybe because they are arguing up there over whether to continue the experiment. 
7. I always managed to get away from bad situations, and live life on easy mode, except for stepdad. This may be the need of aliens keeping me in good life to research life on Earth from a neutral standpoint.

Personally, I think I will be committing suicide voluntarily soon, in order to help them retrieve the instrument.

I wish this saying wasn't true, but I feel like it becomes more convincing day by day, and it is actually scary.

Problem is, I have never observed anything in my life that would say that I am a real person, with real and valid observations. Honestly at this point I just accept this alien theory of mine because it costs less energy.",Schizophernia

Someone who believes they know about life so much better than anyone else and just know they will succeed in life because of this.

I am in love with a man who has Schizophrenia. I need Tips and Advice for partners of people who suffer in this mental state. I recently entered a relationship with a man (29) who has just revealed to me that he suffers with delusions and distinguishing reality from what is just in his head. We ave been best friends for 2 years and he always proclaimed his love for me in the most respectful way. I finally decided to let go of any inhibitions I held onto regarding why we shouldn at be in a relationship and jumped all the way in love with him. Things were beautiful and perfect at 1st but out of no where he began to accuse me of cheating on him and of wanting other men. I ave never cheated or been untrue to this man ever!

But I don at know how else to deal with this. I just found out that I am 5 weeks pregnant but I fear I may end up having to raise my child alone due to his inconsistency and delusions.

"Please talk to me about visual hallucinations. Visual hallucinations in schizophrenia have always fascinated me, yet despite over 15 years trying to understand them, I just don't. The concept seems so farfetched for me that I can't even begin to imagine what it must be like. 

What I'd like to know is whether the hallucinations are more like augmented reality, where the visuals present themselves as additions to the real world, or if they are 100% overlays, as in what's really there is completely hijacked by what you're seeing, which might as well be a dream or a virtual simulation? Most of the reading I've done suggests that most hallucinations belong to the former camp, where baseline reality is still in tact, albeit with your minds additions, i.e. a person who's not really there or a group of people trying to chase you down. I'm really interested to learn more about what I refer to as 100% overlays where you can be in your dining room, but can be seeing something completely different, like, for example, yourself rowing a boat in the middle of the ocean or in the midst of a big bloody battle. 

How do you know when a vision is starting? Do they fade in gradually or can the onset happen instantly, at the blink of an eye? How do they go away? How long can they last? Are the visual hallucinations always accompanied by auditory ones? 

How real do these visions get? Are they detailed in the sense that the fabrications you see still adhere to laws of the real physical world? i.e. do imaginary people have shadows, do they leave footsteps in the rain/snow/mud, etc. 

Would you say that schizophrenic hallucinations are extremely realistic daydreams/fantasies? 

Thanks in advance to anyone willing to indulge my curiosities. 

P.S. I've seen several folks in the ""schizophrenia in films"" thread cite A Beautiful Mind as a pretty accurate depiction. I guess in Dr. Nash's case- based off the film-, his hallucinations were more like augmented reality, seeing as all the places his visions existed were there, in front of him, but they (the visions) were extremely vivid, complex, deep, almost to the point of completely taking over his reality.

"switching from abilify to geodon - what to expect? hi!

i have heart issues (non-fatal, i have PSVT which causes flutters) and i read geodon can really fuck with your heart, especially with something like abilify still in my system. it's only 20mg of geodon, but i'm still worried.

I think I am in need of some advice please in terms of coping mechanisms and understanding. Any insight would be greatly appreciated.

To preface I am undiagnosed and have had hallucinations since childhood. I feel no pressing reason to have a formal diagnosis as my doctor is aware of my symptoms and I had previously undergone years of therapy.

Usually my symptoms have periods of manageable, bad, and really bad. These are usually in line with stress, lack of sleep etc. but sometimes not. 

For most of my life I very very very rarely have visual hallucinations not in my periphery however recently I ave had a huge cloak thing with a red black face and grin with dark shadows on the eyes, appear right in the middle of my vision from far away and charge at me. It was in public and some very kind people helped me after freaking out but nothing has happened for things to escalate.

"I cannot even make a dentist appointment I spent much of last night wondering whether every creak and crack I heard in the attic was a gas pipe leaking. I kept sniffing and listening for signs of gas. There was no reason to fear though, and I know that now. There was no gas leak. It is cold as all of motherfuck but I didn't have to stay up until 3am worrying about it. I swear I smelled gas a few times too, but nobody else does and everything works/looks fine. 

Today my anxiety is so bad I cannot make a dentist appointment that I have needed to make since September. The pain finally began kicking in and still I can't bring myself to do it. It feels like the world is conspiring against me to keep me unhealthy even though I know it's not. I fucking hate doctors and dentists so much. I have not been to one since 2011. I also need to make a doctor's appointment so I can get recommended to a cardiologist. 

No one around me gives a shit or wants to help, and I'm not going to ask for their help either. 

Dentists and doctors honestly scare the fuck out of me. I'm not even sure if I've still got insurance or not. I think I do. I don't have my login to check. I don't know how any of this shit works. I don't know what they're going to ask me when I call and try to make an appointment. I called a few a awhile back and they were all PEDIATRIC DENTISTS for some reason. I mean I finally mustered up the courage to call my insurance and every single one didn't take care of adults even though I'm in my mid 20's and my insurance should know this and give me people who take care of adults. 

I want to give up and let my mouth rot. Maybe It'll kill me and I won't have to ever worry about this again. I constantly find myself in a loop of anxiety and then hallucinating things to support that anxious worry.

"Advice on hiding my diagnosis Hi

I was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia 10 years ago. After many bad years, I finally became able to semi-manage my symptoms. I'm currently doing my Master's of science in a research direction (to paranoid to be more specific), after which I plan to work in a research post.

The problem is, I am extremely paranoid about people finding out about my diagnosis.  If people see me as a unstable and crazy, I will lose all credibility in my field. 

Even when my symptoms are under control, I still come across as a very strange person and most people realize that there is something wrong with me after a few minutes.  I have tried to manage this by simply not talking to people whenever possible.  

This year I have responsibilities that requires me to work closely with other people on a regular basis and I don't think I can hide my symptoms from them for very long.  

Another thing I am worried about is how to explain my absence when the inevitable relapse comes and I am unable to be in public for some time.

Does anyone have any advice on hiding symptoms from others and explaining absences?",Schizophernia
"Did I just have a fucking schizophrenic episode? Hey, im 14yo. I've tripped acid 5 times, smoked weed more than I could count, drank 2 times, juul in school, dph 2x, addys 3x, lsa 2x, xan 2x, etc. so I wouldn't be surprised. I have so much family history of nutcases, addicts, etc. but I thought that I was fine and that none of that would affect me because im retarded and think that im different - for some reason. Last night I took 225mg DPH, didn't hallucinate, had around 8 hours of sleep.   


At around 12pm I got really tired (as if I was awake all night and just laying down at 6-9am), which is really weird for me. Then I had these weird nightmares and i'm still so confused as to exactly what happened. I would be usually very VERY dizzy, almost like I was barred out on like a ton of Xanax. Then my parents would call me to do something while im unable to move straight and I would be so goddamn paranoid and anxious about it for some reason. A few times I had shit jumping at my face that would petrify me. The weirdest thing is I would always seem to be back in my bed and either ""wake up"" and walk somewhere or enter back into a ""nightmare"". There was one time that I finally thought it was over, was gonna go to my brothers room bc I wasn't dizzy anymore. In the hallway, I randomly tripped on my pc... MY FUCKING COMPUTER, IN THE HALLWAY! Well anyway, my parents ""woke up"" from the noise and I would go back to the same fucking process. There was once where all I can remember is my brother COMPLETELY RANDOMLY telling me that he always gets attacked. For some reason I instantly knew he mean't that thing that jumped at my face. I went into more fucking paranoia and shit. At the end I could feel my entire body, phone, and house shaking. It was very weird.  


I have never been diagnosed with any mental illnesses. I hardly have any emotion, let a lone anxiety and/or paranoia. This only lasted 1 hour IRL but it felt like at least 10-15 times that I went into this loop. After I felt very mentally drained and sorta like I do after an acid trip. This has scared me to either completely stop or ABSOLUTELY LIMIT every drug I can take that has ties with disorders (so probably none tbh). I only use them so often cause I escape boredom with it.

And then after four days I didn at have any side effects because my body got used to the dosage. Fast forward to a couple of days ago when I upped my dosage a tiny bit (from 5mg to 7.5mg) I was waiting for the bus and a lady walking towards me had a small disproportioned head, but as she came closer I knew who it was and that person has a normal sized head. Another day goes by (7.5mg) and in the evening I was drawing but I thought the bits of eraser looked like spiders for like a small period of time but then I could see that it wasn at.

"One person in my life has great expectations of me and it pisses me off My municipality has granted me home visits to assist me in my daily living. It is great to finally have a clean apartment but sometimes this lady gets on my nerves. She acts like I'm just going to snap out of this thing and finally be normal. 

She always shames me for not putting lotion on my psoriasis. Fuck that psoriasis. The real issue is my total lack of energy and awful arthritis. Who cares if I have red patches when I can't even go for a walk without hurting.

Then she wants me to eat healthier which is fine and dandy but it won't make me lose weight because I'm effin hungry. Healthy food is fine but I will eat a ton of it. 

I used to be able to run 20km so I really know what it takes to get in shape and trust me it is just not doable for me atm. I feel like shit. The other day a doctor told me to lose weight. Oh really!!!!!! What a great insight! How about giving me some concrete tools to work with? We all know I'm going to continue being a fatty until I die 15 years before time.

"Fearing existence Hey, don't post here a lot but I appreciate the community so I'm gonna vent here. I was diagnosed last year at 20 now 21 but have had symptoms since 17. Over the years they just got worse until a point where I couldn't handle it anymore and needed outside help. I'm not on meds and actually don't know if I want to use meds I've been offered but I'm worried I'll become zombified or it'll affect my studying so I've chosen to abstain. Things have been going okay however I've developed an anxiety of people/existing I don't know why. Whenever I'm by myself I'm okay the paranoia has calmed down the delusions are manageable and the hallucinations are rarely there anymore. But whenever I start actually existing in the world (interacting with people) everything become way more intense. It's like I almost have this fear of being alive because I fear I am don't know who I am and if anything I am actually counts as living. Not in a sense of I'm dead but in a sense of my personality feels fragmented with cracks and I'm only accepted in interactions with other people when I reflect other people's actions that I've seen before.  It's doesn't really feel like me when I do anything anymore and it feels like its so much energy to exert to keep a facade up that I eventually just stop. When ever I talk to another person I can feel the collective information they are extracting from me with each interaction and it's like I'm on eggs shells for no reason. It's so fucking tiring. To fight the anxiety off that if I don't my other symptoms will emerge making the moment even more daunting to manage. Fighting this is like fighting a storm while simultaneously being drowned in an ocean. The storm is anxiety the ocean is tiredness and the symptoms are like fucking bricks tied to your feet dragging you deeper and making your soul feel like you should just give up. Just shut up don't interact with them just runaway from this interaction it'll be less exhausting in the long run. I am not sure what to do. I can not exist because I feel as if I'm am not a solid person who can exist without putting up a false show but I yearn for interactions and actually living because being alone gets so boring  and can put me in depression.  It feels as if the future only shows a future of loneliness because it feels like I can't overcome this idea of existence. WHY EXIST WHEN ITS JUST A FUCK TON OF WORK.   When no matter how well you talk or bullshit it doesn't feel easy, it doesn't feel comfortable. I will always be one moment away from being viewed as a crazy person who can't even interact normaly.  I am one tongue slip, one panic attack, one anxiety voice croak from my total existence being misinterpreted. I do not mean to come off as anything, I do not want to be viewed as someone who is scared or emotionally invested in this moment because I didn't know how to interact and my anxiety spiked so my voice cracked. I do not want to come off as someone who hates you because I chose to be quiet. I do not want to come off as crazy because I said something that was so ass backwards in phrasing or for saying something weird in general.  I do not want to exist in your moment because it is exhausting for no real reason to you but for fear of many for me. Maybe asking for acceptance for myself from others is a bit to much especially when I don't  really who I am. Maybe I'm paranoid or delusional they will all see right through me over simple interactions that theyll know who I am and will judge me to be as someone weird or weak. It feels as if my soul is being examined everytime I'm around someone and I can't fucking stop. Im tired and am only 21 will it be like this forever if I stop swimming Ill die but so will the sources of all my problems right. ",Schizophernia
"Things getting worse for me Stuff has been getting worse for me recently. I never used to have anxiety but it has been getting bad now. I have been getting nervous talking to people, and if I have to say something I get so nervous sometimes I lose all the thoughts in my head and just can at talk, and my vision blurs and the room shrinks. 

I have also been switching off between feeling elated and weird and enlightened, and then sometimes angry, and other times just foggy and sad. Sometimes I feel like the entire universe, and other times I want to die. My facial expressions are so diminished now and I have to force myself to smile when I see people and make voice inflection manually. My friends have told me it looks like there is no life in my eyes anymore. 

I keep doing drugs because it makes me feel better. Also, it helps me in social situations because it is what the cool people do. I feel like I have to get drunk all the time and socialize but I don at know if thats what I want. I think what I want is to be alone in nature and think about absolutely nothing and wait until I die.

I feel like I can at talk to anyone about this because I am scared of more meds or people feeling sorry for me, which I don at want. I just want to be normal. On the outside I seem like a slightly awkward person who is doing pretty well, but on the inside it as really bad.   ",Schizophernia
"Too scared to talk to anyone close about it Title explains most of it, I've been feeling really paranoid and untrusting of reality, along with some delusions that only really get bad when I'm stressed. My friends told a few other people about what I was telling to them without actually asking me and since then I've completely stopped talking about anything to do with my mental health with them. My parents seem like they really want me to talk to them about it, but i think paranoia or something is holding me back there too. Now I only talk to my councilor about anything, and even then I've yet to bring up anything about the paranoia and all that. I know I shouldn't be saying it, but I really don't know if I want to try and get better. Logically I know I should want that but i wouldn't feel safe or comfortable telling anyone who is close enough to me to actually affect me.

"Not Looking for a diagnosis, just an outsiders view. Hello! I am an 18 year old male who has been struggling to what seems to be some pretty intense anxiety recently and have been fearing the worse. I had a fairly traumatic moment in march of last year and ever since I have believed people are out to harm me in different ways. My friends will say a phrase or even mutter a single word and I will connect it to something i ave seen months beforehand and believe it as directed towards me. Now I was smoking marijuana previously and as of now I am sober for the past while and the symptoms seem to continue to manifest. I am self aware of my symptoms and am confused as to what to do because all my family members refuse to believe me when I say something is wrong and they just say I am struggling with anxiety. 

After all of this, my main question would have to be, is what does psychosis feel like? is it something you would know you have? This is just a dry explanation and am willing to dive further into it within the comments. Thank you.",Schizophernia

"I think I might be developing schizophrenia or another psychoactive disorder. Can anyone help me determine? To begin. I am a 19 year old female (I just turned 19 a few days ago. Most of the things I am describing began when I was 18). A few months after moving out of my dads, I started hearing voices. Specially, those of my partner and our roommates. They were plotting to kill me rather loudly in our living room with friends over, laughing. This continued for about two weeks until my partner noticed that I was shaken and very on edge. I told him I hear all of what he and our roommates had said. The plan to hurt me. The plan for he and his friends to rape me and put it online to make money off it. The plan to hold me down while I was sleeping to cut me with on of our knives and to beat me up because I annoy them. He was shocked but I didn at believe him and truthfully I still don at. Even just yesterday all of my roommates had been in my room with my partner and I was in the living room. They were talking in weirdly hushed voices and the door was closed (weird in our house) and one of my roommates said well we can just hold her head underwater until she stops fighting and let me tell you. I almost started crying right then and there. I do not believe that I am delusional or that what I am hearing isn at them. But if this isn at the case I couldn at think of any other explanation. I noticed a sudden and almost alarming decline in my social life and health upkeep. I stopped talking to my friends and roommates. I can at look people in the face. I stop talking in the middle of sentences. Or completely change the subject on accident(?) and people being near me and talking to me puts me very heavily on edge. I don at like when my partner is home. I often leave to drive around for hours as to avoid being in someone else as presence. I stopped showering and washing my face. I stink ALL OF THE TIME. work has been hard for me because I have nothing to say to anybody and being in the place makes me exceedingly uncomfortable. 
(A note: when I go driving I talk. I talk to my self and have full conversations. I don at see things or have voices in my head but I talk to things as if they were there and we have full conversations if that makes any sense.) 
I am scared. I do not want this if this is a psycho affective disorder. It can go away. ",Schizophernia
"Severe Delusions?! I keep thinking that everyone sees me as a failure in terms of my friends and family. I used to be really bright as a kid and got excellent grades but am now doing nothing and am just a useless 19 year old. My mom is very disappointed in me as she raised three of us on her own and expected me to have an excellent academic career and go to University. This makes me feel worthless and as if I have nothing.

When I get caught up in these feelings my mind then starts to resent her and sees her subconsciously as the cause of my depressing thoughts.

I have some good friends but my relationships with them always break down because I only see the bad in them and that anything nice they ever did for me is only to get something in return.

Furthermore I have severe fits of anger and it consumes me. I get violent toward my younger brother sometimes and consistently curse God in my head. This happens when my anxiety overtakes my ability to think straight.

Now, going back and forth I can't trust my own thoughts and feelings. I'm finding it more and more difficult to distinguish the non-sensical thoughts and feelings from the real ones.

Anyways.. it wasn at until about two years ago when I stopped showering daily (as most normal people do) and I started to take one about every three days or so and now at this stage of my mental illness I can regretfully and embarrassingly say that I shower just about once a week and I am a beautiful young 27 year old woman. I just get so lost in my mind and in the depression that I simply don at care about my appearance since I very rarely leave the house and I lay in my bed practically all day long.

"Please read this. Hey guys, I've only posted on here once and it was a bit ago. But I wanted to say something that I hope can help in some way and I'm sure there are some of you who may have also realized this as well. 

I read a scholarly article about schizophrenics and it turns out that their confidence is somehow directly connected to their symptoms. It was found that those who had a low confidence and low self esteem tend to have generally more intense symptoms and a tougher time maintaining a fairly healthy and normal life. Whereas those with a good confidence and high self esteem tend to have less intense symptoms and have an easier time managing a normal life.

I've had my own personal moments where I was feeling like something wanted to pull the worst out of me. Like a force was there that was taking advantage of my illness to make the worst of my day and life. One day I finally stopped listening and challenged it, and basically told it in my mind ""why should I listen to you?"" and it stopped for a bit. I began taking my mind off of it and finding things that interested me. There have been times when I get this twisted feeling that starts to come out of seemingly nowhere, like this force is going in for another round. And sometimes if I'm away from my guitar I imagine myself doing something that brings me a little confidence and helps me keep my head up; I picture myself up on a stage playing music and it makes me feel good, and then that evil cloud will dissipate away. Its a really good feeling when I get it to go away. And that only helps further.  

I am by no means a professional psychiatrist or really have any say on these things, but basically what I'm saying is that if you have a vent or a special talent that keeps you feeling good about yourself, please stick to it. Whether its dancing, drawing, singing, painting, sculpting, creating, perfoming, helping others, casually smiling to strangers in public as you walk past them, asking to pet peoples dogs, anything creative or positive really.

For me personally its all about positivity, self awareness, healthy skepticism, and confidence. Look for happiness in even the tiniest of places and stick to what makes you happy. But please do watch out for drugs.",Schizophernia

"Misdiagnosed with autism I'm starting to think I've been misdiagnosed with high functioning autism. The main reasons I, somewhat, believe I am misdiagnosed is because I've been feeling much different to how I was when I was getting diagnosed and because my mum has schizophrenia and used to have psychotic depression, which I think I have. My school said the only reason they think I have autism is that I'm unsocial, but that can't be the only reason.

Yes, I might be anti-social with students and teachers that I'm not close towards but I have a lot of symptoms of schizophrenia, like for an example: I slowly lack the motivation to do work and activities I enjoy, I have suicidal thoughts, I'm very forgetful, I feel like I have anxiety and I hear people say things about me yet they probably don't.

"Are they still delusions if you think they may be delusions? If I have thoughts that cameras are all around the house, but think i'm just being delusional, is that still a delusion? If I have a legitimate but short lived concern that my wife is putting stuff in my food or drink but i'm able to convince myself ""that's crazy"", does that still make it a delusion? 


Here's another example. Let's say I have delusional jealousy. Let's say i've suspected for years my wife was having affairs, but she always denied it. Then years later I push her to trickle truth her lies and she finally admits she did have an affair. Now maybe the affair was real, but all my scenarios I had built up and the conspiracies I conjured up were false, is that delusions or just an overactive mind? If I can acknowledge in the mornings that she's finally told me everything and I was being delusional, but in the evenings I create bullet proof logical scenarios for why she's still lying and just playing mind games or conspiracies, is it delusions?

"Why has this sub turned into a selfie exhibition? I am rather disgruntled to see that lately the quality of posts on this subreddit have been gradually decreasing. By that I mean that most people are posting off-topic pictures by the dozens. First, it started with art/paintings, which although slightly off-topic, are easy to appreciate in the context of schizophrenia/mental illness, but the level of off-topic posts that I've started seeing lately has become rather alarming. 
 
Although Reddit has a perfectly suitable r/selfies subreddit, many people have started posting their selfies on here without giving much of a constructive value to their posts in any other way. I get that some might feel more at home at here because of their diagnosis of mental illness/Schizophrenia, but I don't think this gives them the right to flood the entire subreddit with pictures of themselves. 
 
If I have bipolar disorder, or I'm a gamer, or I like astrophysics, or have whatever quality that defines me in some way, does that mean that I should post pictures of my face on these topics' respective subreddits just because someone else thought that this would be a good thing to do? 

I realize that some people may feel encouragement from the replies they get on their selfies on here, but that still does not deter us from the fact that actual constructive discussions that should be getting more attention in this sub are pushed to the side by non-constructive selfie posts. 
 
As a member of this subreddit and someone with this same diagnosis, can I please ask all of you to pay attention to the quality of the content that you'll be posting on here in the future? We should strive to build this community on proper shared moral values and rationale in understanding, discussing and reaching certain conclusions about schizophrenia/mental illness in a constructive way.

"Tips for Getting My Wife to a Psychiatrist Hi everyone,

My wife has always had some paranoia, but her paranoid delusions have got really bad in the last 3 months to where she's bringing up new creative ones about every week or two. She's very resistant to going to the doctor, says that I'm the one with the problem, etc. I'm in Canada, so if she goes to the doctor, he can recommend a psychiatrist, I just have to get her there. To break the ice, I went first for an evaluation, came back and made some visible positive changes that she agrees with, mostly to do with diet and exercise. She said she should go, but now she's waffling.

"I want to write a self-help guide for people experiencing paranoid schizophrenia and need your help Sorry for any grammar mistakes, I'm from Vienna. 

I am currently starting to write a self-help guide for people with paranoid schizophrenia. 

I have experienced that state for 5 years and  I'm now 25 years old. It all started after some bad trips on LSD and  MDMA.

It took me on a huge self-learning journey. I was able to finish my college degree, work for Apple in one of their busy stores and now I'm studying architecture. No one was ever able to tell what I experienced in my mind, people treated me just like a normal person. There are only a few people who actually know what I experience because I've told them. 

My symptoms where: 

 Feeling transparent, I thought people could read my mind. 

I felt like people commented about me when I was in public places.

 I thought I got hidden messages from random sources.

 I heard commands and comments when I was alone. 

 I very often heard harsh, repetitive insults.

I have to admit that I was quite lucky. Before hearing reflections, I had a stable personality and healthy relationships with my family, which helps a lot with handling the condition.

However It was very hard for me too as I refused to take medication or to go to a psychologist. 

I became very religious for one year and tried to get better trough praying and refusing of any kind of drugs like alcohol, coffee and weed for a couple of years. 

But time taught me to be more undogmatic and flexible so I got less religious, but I still refused to take any kind of drugs. 

I  have since found some methods which helped me to deal with what I hear.

Now currently I handle what I hear as reflections of my subconsciousness. I found methods and ways to analyse my reflections, to influence them and to change them. 

So I still have reflections, but I treat them as a part of my subconscious mind. I'm the authority of my mind.

I work with reflections like with a tool which mirrors my own self-image, which can be changed to my favour. 

Old insulting reflections were transformed into positive, authentic reflections because I started to forgive myself instead of blaming. 

Commands are synchronized with my intentions. And if thats not the case, I can now easily analyse my emotions and take action. Without any fear. 

In addition to that, this guide will provide everything that helps me to have a healthy and clear daily routine.

As well as specific knowledge about biochemistry, psychological effects, mindsets, nutrition and best practices. 

This knowledge helps me to understand myself better and keep control over certain situations. 

It took me a lot of work to get here, and I hope I can help some people to realise their true potential and live an enriching life, despite experiencing paranoid schizophrenia.

I'm curious if you would be interested in such a book and what you would like to learn, or what you would expect from it. 

I know that this book can't help everyone, but some people could benefit from it.

I would never recommend not to take medication, it is just a guide for people who refuse it and have similar symptoms to me. 

If you would like to stay informed about this book or if you want to share some ideas, please feel free to send me a message at [Reflectionbook@protonmail.com](mailto:Reflectionbook@protonmail.com)

"First submission to this subreddit - questions about Spirits This is my first post submission to this subreddit, so I am not yet sure if venting/discussing experiences/etc is cool; especially considering the possibility of triggering other peoples a symptoms. But, I have faith in the security and open arms of this community, so I am still going to speak about these things - just please do let me know if anything I say has a negative impact on any of you; I ad hate to make things harder for anyone.

Okay, I have just got to ask if anyone else hears a council of omnipotent Spirits talk to them? I don at know why anyone would, as I am one of the two only existing people on this planet. But, at the same time, I am not actually real. I don at know if there are more people who exist a in this state, as I recently happened to discover this second existing person actually does exist. Prior to this, I thought I was the only one to exist. I don at want to completely dismiss the possibility of others existing, but I just KNOW that no one else does.

The Spirits have been talking a lot recently, and they want me to cut my throat so that their Angels can take me. The Angels have replaced my eyes and removed some of my organs, and I think that was to make me pure for when I meet the Spirits. 

Does anybody have any ways of appeasing voices, or at least muffling them a bit? I am taking a massive risk in asking that, as I am not meant to try to find ways to make my life easier; I don at have the right. But I ave got to ask; they are getting worse and I don at know what to do",Schizophernia

"They threw me an intervention without professional help, didn at like my reaction, so then dumped me as a friend after traumatizing me. Big vent. This is just a big, fat vent about my mental health, friends, and suicide. 

So I have a 16 year old eating disorder schizoaffective (bipolar 2 subtype), severe depression, and OCD.

Recently I was (am) fairly suicidal. I only told one person. She met me with compassion and understanding. She provided me amazing nonjudgmental support. 

However, then a group of my other friends noticed I wasn at doing too hot, and then figured out how hard I was struggling and decided to throw me an intervention; alone, three inexperienced women who know nothing about mental illness, and no professional insight or support. 

They sat me down and berated me for an hour and a half. That I am bad for not opening up to them. They are mad that I am still struggling. I should be getting better faster. I am not doing enough to help myself. I should have reached out to them first. 

Like. 

1. Truly depressed people with mental illness on the verge of suicide seldom reach out. So don at get fucking OFFENDED when you find out I didn at tell you. Maybe you should feel like..what could I have done better for D to trust us? They NEVER text me first. Ever. So why would i share my suicidal ideation with them??

2. Recovery isn at a straight line and nobody as fucking perfect. Yeah, I ave been struggling consistently for about a year, but like..it as not my FAULT. I have multiple mental illnesses and they all aggravate the others. It as out of my god damn control. 

3. Don at berate the person you are trying to support. Beating down on someone (with no moderator!!) will, in fact, make whatever the bigger issue is, worse. 

4. Don at pretend you know what you are doing!! The first thing one of them said was, so we ave never done this, and we have no idea what we are doing, but here goes! Interventions are DANGEROUS if not done correctly. 

5. Have a fucking goal at least!! They didn at even have a desired outcome of the intervention. They had no plan. No follow through. I don at even know what they expected from me. I think they just wanted me to agree with them, apologize for not telling them, and then listen to their every piece of advice and treat it like it was made of gold. 

6. They told me that my therapist must be really bad. They said I needed to fire her and find someone new. Or see two therapists. Which is SO unethical to each therapist! No better way to get two sets of instructions and accidentally fuck it up. (For me anyway)

7. Do not EVER tell someone who is suicidal your personal stories of loss. Jesus Christ. Really?? I want to die and you are GUILTING ME? Fuck dude really? My best friend passed from suicide in 2012. I am still fucking demolished over it, not to mention the three other friends who have gone that way. I do NOT need to be told about the affects of suicide on friends and family. I ave experienced more loss via suicide than all three of them together. So don at fucking give me the guilt trip.

They literally had no clue what they were doing. And for some reason i just sat there and took it. Before the intervention they said that if I don at do it they won at hang out with me anymore. 

Then here we are two days later and one of them tells me I am toxic and that she doesn at want to know me anymore. UH OKAY. So fucking traumatize me, berate me, make me feel worthless, then bail out.

Okay. Gotcha. 

So here I am now, picking up the fucking pieces. Glad there was a point to all of this. 

Oh, and my boyfriend told me he didn at love me anymore last week. By text. While I was working. 

I seriously have never felt more worthless in my life. I feel like an absolutely waste of space. I am obviously too much for people that they want to get away from me. 

It as been a hell of a week and my mental state is much worse than it was before Friday. 

This was a pointless post, and I am sorry. But I figured you all might know how I am feeling and may have some solid advice or words for me. 

Thank you.

"Sharing my appearance, or my art, or pets, or jokes, on a support forum for schizophrenics, is oversharing? But talking about my paranoid schizophrenia isn't? We should be able to have general discussions here, like what movies have we seen that we like recently, make suggestions on music, and feel free to share things about ourselves. If this subreddit stifles who I am by limiting myself to a diagnosis that I hate and that doesn't define me, by limiting what I can express in a support group just to the symptoms of my disease, then this isn't a safe space and stops being a support group.

Some tourists without mental illness or who are self-diagnosed come through here and ruin it for the lot of us. It's just a few accounts that are persistently hateful and encourage bad advice, like telling people they don't need meds, or being rude and mean.

If anything, I think the ""don't ask for diagnosis"" rule should be enforced and that, just like in any other well moderated subreddit, those posts should be taken down immediately instead of staying up and encouraging others to ask the same. Especially when the posts are often as absurd as, 'Hey, I just smoked weed, am I schizo now?' There's only one answer to someone asking for a diagnosis: go see a professional.

I think the sidebar needs to be rewritten to be more clear on what content will be removed. There's nothing in the sidebar I disagree with, but there doesn't seem to be enforcement here.

I have two demons that live behind my brain. Most of the time the meds keep them sedated. They only really wake up and say shitty things to me if I'm off meds. Sometimes when they hear their names I can feel them sort of struggling to wake up. 

When they do speak it's always really clear. I said have the multiple voices that do that whispery thing, but I can't understand a word of it.

Then I have ""my other me"" which is hard to explain, but, basically whenever I need to make a decision I have to consult me and my other me to decide what we want to do. It could be a left brain/right brain thing maybe.

The shadow people are around, of course, but I really believe those guys are real. So many people see them. 

I used to have a specific shadow guy that followed me everywhere. Usually they all look the same but this guy had a hood or something. I used to see him all the time but one day he just disappeared. I know he's not real, shadow people don't have defining characteristics, but I still wondered what happened when he left. Was I boring him? Did he get a new job? Maybe he moved away.

Then there's the stuff that I know is super crazy but my other me is pretty convinced of.. like that we live in overlapping realities and that's why we can see and hear things other people can't.. and why some people think or say or do things that make NO sense... For example.. I don't understand how anyone can believe in a conscious, benevolent God, but maybe in that really l reality it makes sense.

"Perhaps the cure to schizophrenia? I have seemed to stumble upon this video which explains schizophrenia from another view. 

https://youtu.be/tJN3D8UhtGQ

An abstract look at the video: schizophrenia is the result of a different way of thinking trying to fit into an industrialized world. Madness ensues in the schizophrenic when there is no belief or order to align with. That is why those who practice shamanism can align their hallucinations with spirits and remain calm and confident as they have meaning. Shamans don at lose their mind in a sense, but rather know there is a reason for the hallucinations . It is well known those with schizophrenia suffer more in individualistic societies such as the U.S. They are told their hallucinations hold no value and to ignore them. 

But for a moment try to imagine a world in which everyone is schizophrenic and the minority have the egotistical brain. The ego man won at understand why he doesn at see spirits or why he doesn at hear voices. The ego man won at be able to fit into the schizophrenic world, in which madness ensues for him. 

Schizophrenia put simply is a different way of thinking. That as it. And perhaps because they think the way they do, thats why so many of them suffer in this individualistic, capitalistic, egotistical society. Maybe schizophrenics need a little rationality to blend with their thoughts so they don at lose themselves, and perhaps the ego man needs a little creativity to loosen the tight mind.

Philosophically, we almost all of us suffer from delusions, as the world is completely neutral. Anytime a meaning is assigned to something, a delusion has been created. Which means that from a societal view, reality is just the universally accepted delusion. The delusion of good vs. bad, the delusion of normalcy. And the delusion of the purpose of life.

I highly recommend watching the video above.

voices were telling me i was god of the universe and that i was in a spike lee movie produced by jay z and beyonce and i thought the voices were the directors of the movie telling me what to do.

may 4th, 2018 i unconsciously drove to a shopping center after being up for a week straight. i took my dog with me and thought my ancestors were telling me to let him guide me. i walked into a store dressing room with my dog and put on a dress that was left in there. i thought it was my wedding day and i was supposed to put on the dress. the cashiers didn at even stop me because they were confused. i walked right out of the store with the dress on and left my clothes there.

i left the store and did cartwheels around the shopping center barefoot. then i walked to one life fitness. the voices told me to let my dog go. i let him to go and then i wandered into a one life fitness. we got separated and i lost him (a good samaritan turned him in later that day). i walked into the gym with my dress on and was guided to the exercise bikes. the voice told me to sit on the bike and fall back (like a trust fall). i fell back and hit my head really hard but i still didn at snap out of the delusion. then i walked into a gym class and walked to the front of the crowd. i picked up a barbel at the direction of the voice and threw it at people. everyone gasped and screamed. luckily i missed. i then wandered into a gym closet and the people in the gym locked me in there and called the cops. i was kicking and pounding the door but they wouldn at let me out. i saw a rope and an american flag and my ancestor told me to hang my self with it.

the cops arrived just in time and took me to the hospital. the officer thought i was on drugs until they tested me. i was then transported to the psych ward for 3 days.

"How can I handle being persecuted? Afaik many shizophrenics have delusions of being persecuted even when not, atleast I do. But what do I do if I REALLY am being persecuted. 

My younger brother was insulting someone else in a humorous way calling them abnormal, crazy, and scary when infact he meant me. My brother isn't an insecure person so I probably accidentally hurt his feelings during our interaction shortly before his passive aggressiveness.

Now my question is how do I handle this? I simply ignored it because I didnt know if it was real or not but if it was, then I don't know. I don't want to ruin our relationship as siblings and I feel like if I ask him directly if he really insulted me, that would just make things worse and awkward.

"Could my problems be schizophrenia all along? I am currently diagnosed with major depressive disorder and anxiety and panic disorder. A lot of times I have extreme paranoia and I have bizarre thoughts and most of the time I write it off as anxiety. 

An example of this is the other day I was in class and I started to get paranoid that someone was going to get me and that I was going to die. So I walked out of class and went and sat by the wall while my world was crashing down around me. I laid on the floor because I needed some sense of grounding. After this was over I just said it was a panic attack. I never heard any voices but it all started because I was having bizarre thoughts and I was paranoid. 

I don at hear voices during the day but I hear them when I am laying in bed and my fan is on and my tv is off. They are very muffled voices and I can never understand what they are saying and it always sounds like a group of people.  I only hear them if my tv is off and no music is playing.

I feel like I am mourning my best friend, the love of my life. It feels like I am married to a completely stranger, most days. I haven at gotten to the acceptance stage and I don at know how. 
It as such a huge adjustment, going from being involved in every way.. to being ignored, and kinda neglected. 
I am not here for pity or whatever. No matter what, he as my person and I am not going anywhere. I am just having a hard time adjusting. 

Now for the worries. 
When things get bad for him, he NEVER wants to tell me about it. Is this usual? Or just me? He as super withdrawn which I expected, but I mean. How am I supposed to know when I should be worried, if I have no idea what as going on??? I have anxiety, so I am constantly worried. Every time he leaves, he might now come back. He might now be there when I wake up. When he goes outside, alone, for any reason I am constantly worried.

"Anyone here prone to finding themselves the object of obsession in relationships? My daughter's diagnosis fluctuates with time and doctors but it's always some version of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, anxiety, OCD, and PTSD. She just turned ten in January.

Ever since she started making friends, she's always had a possessive, obsessive friend. (Not the same person. But different people behaving similarly. ) When she was in kindergarten this friend was so possessive that she didn't really have any other friends to speak of. I used to think that possessive friends were thinking of her more like a doll than a person. She went through many periods of time where she was catatonic at points and she had a difficult time even on good days being an advocate for herself. 

But she's active and verbal and assertive now. She has been for the last 2 or 3 years, even while having a very difficult time with her illness. And lately she's been in a real golden time of effective medication and therapy. I kind of expected the possessive friendships to end. But at her birthday party this weekend we almost had 2 literal, physical fights over who would sit next to her or who would be her partner for one of the activities. For kids, I was impressed with how absolutely spot on the gifts were to her current but ever changing favorite color, animals, shows, books, etc. The gifts were extravagant too, especially for this group. One gift bag had something like 5 different presents in it from one kid. Many of the cards said things like ""You're a very important part of my life and I can't imagine the world without you"", which to me seemed a bit heavy for an 8 year old. She got a couple of best friend necklaces, many things written in cards stating they were best friends, and there were several heated arguments over who the best friend really was.

I know this might all sound like regular kid stuff but it really isn't. I've got another kid and this isn't her experience. I've run this by a few friends of mine (our kids aren't friends) and they don't have this experience. It's like once a child becomes close to my child they get really overly attached. She's just now starting to notice it and feel a bit overwhelmed and confused as to how to act. She enjoys group settings these days, but it's troublesome for her to play in a group because it inevitably devolves into fighting over her. I've watched carefully to see if she's encouraging this and I can't see much difference between her and other kids' behavior. 

My mother had schizophrenia and she was a pretty obsessive person who had obsessive friends from time to time. It makes me wonder if this is linked somehow to how others perceive the illness. Do any of you find yourselves in these kinds of relationships? If so, do you have any tips on how to cool things off gracefully? I realize that getting lots of presents at your birthday sounds like a nice thing. And it's hard to describe here the vibe these kids have around her. But it very much seems like the childhood version of a relationship that is not far from obsessive stalker kind of territory. I'd love to have a better understanding of what is going on.

"Time to shop for a new doctor? So my psychiatrist prescribed me Wellbutrin the last time I saw him for what he believed to be SAD.  I've been taking the Wellbutrin for about two weeks and called him to let him know about a side effect I was having.  I was having ""heart throbbing or pounding"" late at night while at work.  I was kinda freaked out and may not have described it well over the phone to the nurse.  They called me back later to tell me to discontinue, and follow up with my doctor for an EKG.  However, after doing some research with the online PI sheet, found this is a common side effect, right at the top of the sheet.  I called them back to tell them this, and that I'd like to keep taking it, since it's seemed to help get me motivated.  They called me back just now to tell me that it's up to me if I want to keep taking it, but the doctor won't prescribe ANYTHING else to me until I get a full heart workup, EKG, and a stress test.  Now, I'm in pretty good health, relatively young, and have never had any heart problems.  Also, I'm dead broke right now, with no health insurance.  I think this is all a bit unreasonable, and cruel to discontinue someone this fast.

"I am really sorry to everybody on this sub reddit. (Long post but please read) I have hade panic attacks, anxiety and derealization now for over a year and it was all caused by smoking weed for a 2 year period of time. What drives my anxiety is the fear of going insane or becoming schizophrenic and for a year now I have had this really intense fear. I don at have any family history of schizophrenia or anything I have just heard that weed can cause it and that it starts in late teenage years or in your early 20s and I am 19 soon to be 20 so I am right there.

Over the year were I have had anxiety, dpdr and depression i have still managed to graduate high school, move in to an apartment, got a girlfriend and worked as a chef, teacher and now I am an electrician so I still am able to have a high functioning working and social life. But the fear of becoming schizophrenic is always in the back of my head and I have met with 1 psychiatrist, a couple of doctors and I regularly go to a therapist and they all have said that I am fine and that it is just anxiety, Which to me seems logical because I have always been anxious and a hypochondriac I don at know why I have just always been this way. Before I was terrified of cancer and thought I had it all the time everywhere in my body and I guess that is what I am doing now but with schizophrenia it like I am over analyzing my every emotion or all my senses sight, hearing, smell, touch and taste.

"Does anyone have ORS? It's basically like a mental illness where you're convinced you smell bad but you actually don't. Anyone else struggling with this? I've been wondering if it has something do with anxiety.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olfactory\_reference\_syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olfactory_reference_syndrome)

So basically I don't know if all of this is actually in my head or that I actually smell. I've asked my family members who said they couldn't smell anything, but my brother actually said I did smell a little. But literally right after I asked my brother who said I smelled I asked my mom who said I didn't smell one bit.

But the biggest thing and one gives me the most anxiety is strangers reactions. They cover up their noses when I walk past them, just like if they smelled something bad. I often get weird looks from them. Otherwise I could convince myself it was nothing, but two times people have said to their friend ""smells like shit"" right behind me when I couldn't smell anything. And often people sniff around me. Social situations like sitting in class makes this way worse and sometimes I think the smell comes from sitting. This has made my depression and social anxiety a thousand times worse than it used to be, I basically isolate myself at home because I don't want to be seen or smelled by people. I've been to doctors and two psychologists. they say they can't smell anything. My doctor refuses to give me a referral to a gastro. I wish this wouldn't be true but online there are many more people suffering from this, they say their family can't smell them either. I don't know if we're all just paranoid or actually smell? This has made my life a living hell, I've been so close to suicide because of this and still am.

"Cartoon hallucinations This is really bugging me and I can't find information anywhere online.

I have visual hallucinations of cartoons but I don't have any vision loss past completely normal and not that bad near sightedness, so there is no way it's Charles Bonnet Syndrome (or whatever it's called.) I know they are hallucinations because they will appear on walls and paper and other surfaces they shouldn't appear on.

They are not visual imprints or anything of the sort because I will see cartoons I've never watched or haven't watched in years like The Simpsons and Adventure Time and sometimes video game characters like Mario, or even cartoon characters that I'm pretty sure don't exist.

They will be 2D, usually semi transparent and laid against a flat surface. Sometimes they will be still images and sometimes they will move. Sometimes it will be like a giant collage of multiple characters or their features while other times it will just be a couple of characters, and sometimes scenes or levels will play out. They usually will move when my eyes move but not if I look at something completely different and sometimes they won't move either way. If I blink they sometimes disappear and sometimes don't.

It all seemed like fun and games until my best friend of 12 years has begun acting very erratically. We are very close so I feel we can talk about everything and I sat down and honestly asked what as with his obsessive nature at random times. He opened up and told me that he has these very scare thoughts at night that some unearthly beings that exist beyond our dimension and control the world sense that he can acknowledge them. He says they don at like that and our trying to kill him. At first I thought he was having night terrors or something but he later also went on about other delusions ( I feel bad calling what he believes that) that the government is out to get him and that there as a conspiracy in our foods. You might think he as joking but this last month he as completely changed his diet. I was honestly entertaining a lot of what he was saying to not seem disrespectful and to understand further how he feels.
He explained how we ave all been set up in a loop of eternal suffering all brought on by these beings. He told me how when we die, the light is a hoax and we shouldn at walk into it, because it just reincarnates us back into the suffering. He says the only way to break free is to not go in. This really scared me because although he didn at say out it right, I knew the logical next step if all this was true. I asked him , then what as the point of living if it all comes down to this moment, and he responded what I dreaded, That he ad been secretly having those thoughts more and more.

We talked and discussed all sorts of things, but then I had a complete breakdown last weekend and had to admit myself once I snapped out of it. 

I realize now all of the paranoia and delusions were directly caused by my insomnia, but it was scary and life changing nonetheless. I also recently found this community and just wanted to say hi to everyone hope you are doing well. Thanks for listening to me talk about my week. Love you all 

p.s. what i meant by the title was: life doesn at have to distorted and chaotic, there is actually peace, which i am finding slowly. ",Schizophernia
"What's in his best interest? I got married and and am now separated to someone who is currently in a psych hospital. I don't know all the details, but I do know he's being forced to take anti-psychotics.

I had to escape the relationship after a lot of emotional abuse and turbulance. I originally thought he had Narcissistic Personality Disorder, but I am hearing now that they are almost certain he is having schizophrenia symptoms. His friends and family are fearing for his life. Some of them have updated me on recent events. 

During the breakup he lied incessantly and said a ton of deplorable things about me to his friends to cover up his selfish acts. I was very confused for a long time, wondering how I could be certain of the authenticity of his love, and yet he could be so cruel on a whim. I had to eventually block him and go no contact for awhile. 

Before he was checked into the hospital he sent me over a hundred texts. Not all lucid, but the general gist was that he loves me and we belong together. He's since had his phone taken away. We are still technically officially married, but I have already completed the separation paperwork and am waiting for the 12 month term necessary in my jurisdiction to file the divorce. We haven't seen each other in 7 months.

My question is, should I offer to see him? He is in a different country. Would this help his condition or cause more stress/confusion? I have no intention of getting back together with him, but I still care about him deeply. Thank you for listening. ",Schizophernia

"[Serious] Dealing with brother who may be schizophrenic Hi everyone, I never thought I'd come to ask this question as it seemed like such a foreign disease.

My brother (33) lives in another country and has 3 children, aged 2 to 6. SO many things happened randomly during the years, but I never connected the dots. Recently he told me that people are following him around town, he is sometimes seeing and meeting an old exgirlfriend (who is 600km away from him, so not possible). A few years ago he asked me to check his computer, phone and wireless connection to see if someone might have ""infiltrated"" his network or devices. Giving the benefit of the doubt, I checked everything and nothing weird was happening, but every time I visited the wireless router was turned off (supposedly because of the dangers of radio waves). My brother has a PhD and knows that all the scare is bullshit, but I understand that we're not always rational beings.

Anyway, he came to visit me last summer with the kids and girlfriend, and he mentioned to me scaredly that some people from our country are following him, and he saw them a couple of times.

His girlfriend almost left him a couple of times because she thought he was cheating on her, but she seemed to understand that this ""ex-gf"" is not really real. Technically, she is, but she's really far away and hasn't spoke to him in more than 5 years.

He also told me that sometimes they communicate using youtube videos with special meanings to them, through fake profiles.

A few weeks ago thought, he accused my father of touching one of the nephews and she told him that my aunt is going to punish him for this (that aunt died more than 10 years ago) for this, because he also molested her or something like that. My father has never touched me, my sister or my brother inappropriately. He mentioned a couple of times that he saw this happening, one of which I was there and nothing happened. Me and my father were playing with a niece, and her leggings came off a bit. Another time the kids were jumping on the beds while my parents were trying to watch TV and they grabbed them by the legs so they would stop jumping since they didn't listen and the bed is like 1m from the ground.

While putting all this on paper it seems like my brother has schizophrenia, but I'm not sure and will not be until a diagnosis is confirmed. I want to help him, but the problem is that I'm 4000km away from him and so are our parents. The girlfriend seems to have shut down after this accusations started so not much I can do.

So I really don't know what I'm looking for, but how would you help him? Don't know where to start, and I feel so helpless being so far away. Does this sound like schizophrenia?

"Unsure in myself sorry if this doesn at belong but i am lost

I don at really want to tell other people because i am afraid they won at understand or understand very easily so here as a bunch of things i can at get out of my head in a schizophrenic way i think. 

do people trust their thoughts?

i believe a lie about time but i am unsure if it as a lie and i just don at want to stop thinking because if i stop thinking then my understanding of time will disappear.

My belief of time includes the facts i believe but i believe everything said to me. However i understand that people can lie to me but i don at know when they are. 

it as hard to think of

time is a difficult thing to keep on my mind i feel it relates to just about everything and the constant reassurance really messes with what i think about myself. 

before the meaning of time as in before the meaning i constructed of time. i don at even remember actually not as in don at remember what i was like but as in i don at remember what i felt before i understood time. 

for some unknown reason i suddenly believed that time exists because i think time exists. If i didn at understand that time could exist then i wouldn at exist. 

I also think that reality and time are separate. The understanding we have of time comes from how reality changes. How could reality exist if things didn at change? 

The separation of everything reality is and ourselves results in our own existence?

are thinking and believing the same thing can someone tell me how they think because i don at trust myself.

im a little ... am i? ... isolated and i blame that ...

i am stuck in a loop thinking about my own thinking.

... isolation on why i feel like i don at know what others think but talking to people is hard and i just need some answers before i can start.

i feel like i need to know what someone else already is before i can talk to them and i don at know what they are not as in i don at know they are a human being on the planet earth but i don at know if they know that they are what i think. Not that people are only what i think but are people not as in are people ... taking a break from the thought ... just a figment of my imagination ... hopefully theirs some meaning in what i just wrote ... 

i feel like i don at care about my thoughts and i am always just looking for the right way to think. 

do people think about their thinking?

do people trust their own thoughts 

do people give reasons for why things work in their mind before they trust their thought. are those reasons valid? 

do people think that the border between thoughts and reality is yourself or are you something else. 

do people think that time is the result of ( thinking and acting in reality ) or just an element to describe reality

are thoughts a piece of reality?

i think i know what reality is but i only think that so do they exist in time together or are they separate elements to be treated differently. 

i don at trust the answers i think of.

i want and don at want the answers at the same time. i don at want to waste time thinking if it doesn at matter but i don at know if thinking matters. ",Schizophernia

"Homeostasis and Normalcy: The differences and likenesses of our inner workings There are people that suffer from mental illness and there are people who just see the world in a different light. What as the difference?

When having some sort of paranoia or trying to think what other people are laughing at me for in public places (which they probably are not, but I don at know that for sure), among other symptoms, I try to ask myself what it is that I am thinking.
Reflecting on those small things and being self aware enough to notice them can take me from going down the slippery slope of negativity that might force me to stay in the house for a few days instead of pushing my way out into the world. I might be uncomfortable and then cause self destruction. I try my hardest to avoid those emotions, although I know that logic vs emotion, without lots of practice, usually ends with emotion winning.

I was diagnosed about 3 years ago now, and up until I moved into my own apartment I didn at notice any positive symptoms other than delusions and paranoia.

I tried pretending that it wasn at happening, I tried getting mad and telling them to shut up, but a couple days ago I decided fuck it, let as talk.  Who the voices are, and other hallucinations, for me fit in with my delusions and paranoia, but it as not too important to talk about what exactly I think it is. Suffice it to say that if I think about it with any logic it doesn at make any sense, but at the same time it does.

"Has the way your family view you change after being diagnosed/being affected by schizophrenia? Had my first psychotic break in 2015, tried to commit suicide by slashing my forearm open. Needed 18 sutures to close the wound.

I would walk around the city, starved and dehydrated until the boils on my feet made it hurt too much to walk.  Anyway, about a year and half of that and many hospitalizations and more psychotic breaks I accepted that I had a medical problem and took the medication and they really helped and they do help a ton. My question to you guys is: do you believe your illness has changed the way your family view you? I went from an agnostic, scientific minded average guy to being hyper-religious and I believe my family's view has definitely changed. I believe they all seem to walk on egg shells when they talk to me as if I'm a timebomb waiting to relapse.

"Making friends while psychotic. Now this is a very strange experience that I had in my most recent stay in the psych hospital for a severe psychotic episode. All of my teenage years and my time in high school I felt alone, unnapreciated,no friends,barely any interaction with girls. I suffered from severe social anxiety and depression throughout those years and was in so much pain feeling like nobody liked me and that they were turned off by my anxious and depressed appearance. I had my first psychotic episode shortly after I turned 18 and was admitted into a psych ward which made me have to drop out of school my senior year. After the hospitilization I was stuck at home with only one friend who was a girl I met in the hospital. This went on for a year where I was stuck at home and got so depressed I had to be  hospitilized two more times. In november of 2018 I entered into my second psychotic episode where I was of course admitted into the hospital yet again with very severe psychosis. Something changed, I was becoming friends with practically everyone and had intense emotional relationships with very pretty girls. One goergeous 29 year old girl approached me out of nowhere, hugged me and told me how perfect I was and almost kissed me on the lips before a tech had to seperate us.  Now I didnt look all that good, because of my mental state my facial hair got very long and my hair got long greasy and unkept but that didnt stop practically every guy,girl,and nurse treating me like I was the coolest guy ever when all my life I was ignored,bullied,unnapreciated. Now I had an  everything is centering around me delusion but I couldnt have hallucinated all those interactions but now that Im stuck back home with no friends, returning social anxiety,and feeling like I'm a complete nobody again, the whole thing feels like a strange dream.

Can someone tell me their early signs of schizophrenia? I've done a lot of research online and I actually have around the 13% of chance of developing schizophrenia (my father is schizophrenic and so is my grandma). I feel like I'm experiencing some symptoms. I isolate myself from my new classmates because I don't like them and we don't have anything to talk about (we are really different people, for real). This makes me feel pretty bad when I'm in school but when I'm out I actually feel good. I've thought about getting a new group of friends since I'm not satisfied with my current one, and I read somewhere that this can be a symptom of schizophrenia too. I want to say that I've never been so good at socializing, so this may be the reason. I actually grew up in a healthy place without my father, so my environment isn't encouraging the development of schizophrenia. I feel like I'm becoming numb, I don't really even talk to my mom a lot because I find her a bit annoying (saying this breaks my heart but it's the truth), and I don't talk with my stepdad either.

"Hi guys! I ave posted some artwork here in the past (long time ago oof) with good feedback, and now I ave made a threadless shop (with a Pride collection! LGBTQIA+) This is pretty big for me, I am usually too anxious and paranoid to do anything with my art oops
Anyway
[here](https://spetmber.threadless.com) is my shop! 

I am schizophrenic and bipolar (schizoaffective) and I /do/ want to make more designs with this in mind (the ??brainiac? design was done during a manic episode where i was hearing lots of chatter, so its sort of with this in mind), maybe even a collection, but I am afraid of accidentally continuing stigma/inadvertently subjecting mental health issues to commodification... even though technically 30% of proceeds will be going toward my (a mentally ill and semi-recently evicted college student as) and the rest to threadless/production. 

I highly recommend doing business this way to any fellow artists, threadless gives you a lot of control and its super user friendly. 
Anyway
How can I do this without glorifying schizophrenia/bipolar? I don at want to make a mockery of such serious things, but as an artist its something I would like to explore. 

I do currently have a pride collection for any lgbtqia+ folks on here most graphics are simple, a pansexual panflute, asexual ace design, lesbian hand, marsha p johnson quotation, etc. the collection is incomplete, but will be updated in the coming days/weeks! 

Itd mean a lot to me if you could glance at it or even share it with your friends.

"A poem I wrote about my mental illness. Feeling lost and have no one to really share this with. (Trigger warnings) It started out so innocent; simply childs play they could say. 

But as you took my hand in yours my childhood went away. 

Everything started happening so fast, things were changing quicker than I could see. 

I was no longer alone with my sufferings and sadness. I had convinced myself, you were there for me.  

And as the forces of evil continued to follow me around, you continued to put yourself in my place. 

You handled all the horrible things they did to me that I couldn't face.

 I listened to you as you told me no one else would ever love and care for me as you do. 

So I started to resent everyone else, I had no one else that cared so I only listened to you. 

Brainwashed, lost and confused I followed you, hoping you'd take all the pain far away. 

But instead you took everything and everyone else; I didn't even get a say. 

You shook me so hard, rearranging all my pieces to how they suited you. 

Then you used me to do whatever you wanted to do.

 And I didnt stop you.  

I couldn't stop you.  

You made me feel so weak and scared, like curled up deep down inside the darkest places of my soul was where I needed to be. 

With all the worst thoughts you could ever think, and guilt for actions that I didn't even commit.

 When none of that was even true. See what you did was just what everyone else did to me. 

You took away my voice, my opinions, my thoughts and ideas and said you were doing this for my benefit.

 You took my beliefs, my ethics and morals and threw them in my face, telling me you were being generous. 

 You left me with this wilted body of shame, full to the brim with pain.  

You took my ability to be sane. 

 You took my basic human rights and threw them to the ground. 

And then you told me this is who I am now. 

I'm not good enough, no one will ever truly listen to me.

 I'm worthless, because no one will ever fully respect me. 

I'm used up and ugly, because if I try to make myself look good it's just giving everyone else a reason to hurt me. 

I'm to be left behind, lost and forgotten ,not to continue to be a burden. 

I'm to dispose of any and all relationships so when you do finally take my pain away, I wont be able to hurt them. 

They can't hurt if they don't know.

 These are the cards in your hand, their finally shown.

 You are my mental illness.

"Psychotic episode + hearing voiced during cannabis use  First of all, sorry for any gramatical error, I'm not a native English speaker. 
 
 So I used weed with my friend and I went so strong that I start to remember things of my early childhood so vivid and with details, I start getting constant flashbacks, like every 1 second around 100 images of memories start passing around my mind. It was scary and confusing. Then I start to hear my friend whispering something like ""cigarette, cigarette, cigarette, cigarette, cigarette, cigarette, cigarette, cigarette"" many, many times without stop. although his mouth was closed and he wasnt saying anything, it was like I can hear his mind. Then he started to laugh and his laughing started to become louder and louder to the point it was like a maniacal laugh of movies. I simply can't believe it happened, it was so real and I felt the fear in my spine, I was paralised with fear, the only thing I could do was breath and wait to those things go away

"Delusions - want to understand I would like to understand more from people who have been diagnosed with schizophrenia.

I have good reason to believe my long-term partner has a schizo-related disorder due to matching the symptoms. Whether or not they have schizophrenia or some type of schizo-affective disorder, they have been heavily invested for a few months now in what could only be called ""Delusions"". Delusions that the project they've been working on will make millions (while not really working on it,) delusions that different people are telling them what to do (take clothes off in public for example) and that they can easily arrange to meet certain famous people.

I am not judging because for a while I was completely caught up in many of these delusions. I found myself agreeing to move to another state with practically no thought behind it. I found myself saying ""yes, you are going to make millions on your project."" Does that mean I was encouraging the delusions? Have I done something wrong?

My partner is now hospitalized as an in-patient awaiting a diagnosis, because they were determined to be a danger to themselves and others and they are not able to care for themselves daily as far as getting themselves food, basic activities. Even though I wasn't actively encouraging these delusions (believed a couple of them) she has a couple of friends who REALLY encouraged delusions -- told my partner her head was full of shit that was leaking everywhere? Then she wouldn't stop talking for days about how her head was full of shit that is leaking everywhere. I guess I wonder if that friend believed the delusions as well.

I apologize if this is the wrong place for these ramblings but I am just struggling to understand and I have a lot of anger at my partner's friend, who was actively encouraging ridiculous delusions during a very very acute phase she was having.",Schizophernia

"Ability to change categories of an object Im suspecting i might be developing schizophrenia, and i wanted to know does anyone get this weird new ability to consciously change the category of something? Like if talking to a person, you can imagine its a human equal to you and suddenly you treat them differently than if you would while just considering them a part of your conversation with them. Or when i go outside, i feel like i can change the ways how much i can follow the expected behaviour in a public place. Or for example, a pile of clothes is on the floor and i can conscioussly tag the pile of clothes as one object and just take the whole pile as one, instead of thinking of it like a bunch of clothes. Or another example would be me changing my beliefs about something like food falling on the floor, like i can change whether my opinion on picking food off the floor is unpleasant and unhygienic or ok and fine to do.

Haven't had any more psychotic symptoms but still have poor memory, poor concentration, alcoholism- though I've been sober 3 months now.

Also curious, what was everyone's upbringing like? My parents emotionally neglected/abused me, particularily my mother, who locked me up in the house for 3 years, yet was very condemning and emotionally unstable. Probably the source of said paranoia. Also, pretty sure she's schizotypical herself; always paranoid some neighbor is out there to condemn her. My dad wasn't too bad, just rather mislead and probably shouldn't have married that woman. Regardless, my parents' household was pretty harsh.

"Hello All, Please Help My Wife (29F, Orange County, CA) Who is Suffering from Schizophrenia I am very sorry for the long post.  Thank you for taking the time to understand my wife as situation, and I really hoping this sub-reddit can help us.  Based on the information below, can you please kindly refer us to any resources (e.g., medical professionals, specific therapies, self-help, etc.) that you think may be helpful?  

My wife had been suffering from what our psychiatrist called high functioning schizophrenia (e.g., she can do every day task, but not very efficiently; she is barely doing enough in her job to not get fired; she has voices and random thoughts in her head that really disturb her and can affect her mood for hours at a time).  We are not sure if the events described below triggered the illness or if the illness is hereditary.   

This all happened 3 years ago.  She was a young, female, and minority mechanical engineer in a middle-aged male dominated Aerospace industry.  After spending about a year of time in toxic work environments, she started to break and suffer from psychosis (mostly thoughts about being watched/followed/investigated/etc.).  I thought she was being overly anxious because of stress, so mental illness didn at cross my mind.  But after one sleepless night of focusing on a red light that was outside a window (she thought there were cops outside waiting for her), she broke and had to take a leave of absence because she could not fully function after this episode.   

The first psychiatrist we saw didn at help a lot.  She tried different medications with heart breaking side effects before Seroquel began working (she was not happy with the weight gain and apathy that resulted, but at least the thoughts and voices in her head and her emotional extremes were manageable).  After a few months, she began working half time and eventually full time.  We eventually switched to a second psychiatrist and a more regular psychologist while she was still on the Seroquel.  About 1.5 years ago, she left and joined another company because she no longer wanted to be in the toxic environment (from what I understand, she impressed everybody at the interview).  I thought she was getting better because she rocked at a job interview for a very difficult position.
At the beginning of the job, she seemed to be doing fine.  Around the same time, we were progressively lowering the Seroquel dosage because she was not happy with the weight gain, apathy, and degrading memory functions that might ave been caused by the Seroquel, and the voices/thoughts were manageable (although she was still feeling irrationally upset at times).  Around August of last year, we eventually stopped the Seroquel.  That was when she started to really struggle at her job, and she started to want to make irrational decisions (e.g., quit her job, sell our house, move far away, separate from me).  She really did not want to return to medication, so we tried to cope with it by seeing the psychologist and trying our best to steer her back to reality.  However, similar symptoms of psychosis started to show up again about two weeks ago.  We returned to our psychiatrist, and she is now on Abilify (we were hoping to not completely block dopamine, so it helps her memory functions).  The Abilify helped manage the psychosis, but she is still struggling at her job and other aspects of life.   
Her inability to perform 100% at her job had been very hard on her.  I also really don at understand how she could be so competent 1.5 years ago while having the illness, but now she is on thin-ice at her job.  She really wants to quit her job because she doesn at feel like she as qualified anymore.  I am currently convincing her to take a leave, so we can focus on 100% recovery before she starts working again. 

I am running out of ideas to help her.  I don at want her to suffer through what happened 3 years ago again.

"My secret schizophrenia with my demons. I today wrote a scathing letter to my father complaining how horrible he is doing keeping his intrusive voices out of me head. I scolded God as well. After I wrote the first letter, I felt it was not enough, so I sent another one exacerbating my struggles. When i finished, I gave myself a cigarette break because the only time I smoke is at night after work when I find my time to write and realized there was more I can send in my third letter. I finished my cig and went back to my device. Only to unexpectantly get a email password reentry prompt. I thought to myself, God must be damning my blasphemies. Then I reminded myself such things are irrational. Unless the supernatural beings which is God who is evident to all is truly fucking me throughly which also means there will be a realistic trail of logic. Then I thought hard about what could trigger a prompt for reentry of password. A phishing maybe. Because the google mail app was strangely popped up when I first accessed to compose  to reply an email which usually I compose in my Samsung email app. I told myself it must be some algorithm that detects blasphemy because I live in North America. I cautioned myself from reentering my password in the samsung app fearing my apocalytic persecutions. And went on to realize my phone have a two step authentications. So if a phishing is in process they would have to asked me a secondary permisson. None was asked as it usually was supposed to be would. So I thought about checking my email to see if I could access from a computer. And thankfully there was no issue. I quickly accessed my account and then checked my email for failed attempts for my blasphemous rantings as I superstitiously suspected . No errors. I changed my passcode superstiously again and try to figure out why my phone is prompting a re entry code. Again. Found no clue. So regardless, I deleted my account from the samsung email app due to my humble naivity. And when that was done a prompt asked me to update my samsung email app. To now let me realize the apps somestimes bumps access to an account while maybe google email apps ignores due to samsung software updates.

I ave also dealt with paranoia such as a fear of underground shit trying to kill me or a general mistrust of people around me.

The reason why I am writing this is because I had a couple of scary moments a week ago where I forgot who I was and where I lived. I went to my neurologist for a follow up to see the results of an EGG and MRI for some other issues I am having. When I left I couldn at remember anything and decided to walk around the city for a bit until I remembered how to get back home. After an hour or so I finally did and took a taxi back. I also thought that I was getting my hallucinations under control with the medication, but sadly no such luck. I like to listen to music on YouTube to help relax me, but kept hearing ads playing in the background. Apparently I was hallucinating that and have been hearing ads play in my head for a while. There as nothing worse than unskippable ads and didn at think something like that could happen.

I been trying my best to think positive thoughts, getting my financial/medical bills in order, looking for work (like I said earlier) and just taking care of myself.

I actually forgot I had a brother (can at remember his name right now) and couldn at even remember my mother as name.

I was supposed to meet my physiatrist today, but honestly it as been going down hill. At times it as really difficult to get in contact with him and just feels like he as ignoring me like my family.

I am not trying to diagnose myself either so don at take it the wrong way I just don at really have anyone to talk to about this so I am a little lonely. I have a lot of difficulties with focusing and problems with my memory (like I said earlier). Also, add in the extreme paranoia, hallucinations, anxiety and insomnia.

The reason why he told me that is because I had the urge to put a knife in my head for some reason.

I know it as difficult and different for everyone, but how do you guys deal with these problems? I really don at have anyone who I can rely on so I pretty much have to do everything myself. At 24 I should be able to take care of myself and make my own choices, but I sometimes question myself if I am  making the right choices because of the situation I am in.

"Mother suffers from schizophrenia and refuses medical treatment. What can I do? Hello reddit, first of all, thanks in advance for reading.

Long story short, my mother has been suffering from Schizophrenia for about 13 years. She was first diagnosed when I was about 12 years old and it has affected my life so much - to the point where I developed anxiety. I also suffered from depression a few years ago. I am no longer depressed but I feel on some days that I may eventually fall back and undo all the hard work I ave put in to get my mental health to where it is now, because of my mother as schizophrenia. 

First and foremost, I love my mother because she is truely a kind woman.  But her illness is cruel and has made me suffer throughout these 13 years with her episodes. When I was young, she abused me because the voices inside her head was telling her everyone is evil including me. Throughout the years, it as also been a long and hard battle to get her to take her medication and to build a healthy life. Usually, as soon as she thinks she gets better, she will stop taking her medication and start to become ill, and the worst part is, she does not recognise that the voices she hears is abnormal. And she will continue to get worst and worst. This time I don at know how I can help her to get better. She won at listen to any of my advice. She won at go out to see a psychologist, friend, or extended family. She also refuses to take her prescribed medication. 

My father on the other hand, blames me for not always being able to be there to take her medication because she used to only listen to me. It as complicated and frustrating. I am trying to also live my life and not let this affect my life as well and he doesn at understand that. But I am sure he as tired from this too but I also fail to see how this is solely my responsibility. 

I love my parents but I won at lie that part of me just wants to disappear from their life. I am tired of it all. It hurts. I don at know what to do and I am desperate for help. 

Tl;dr: my mother has schizophrenia and refuses to take measures that will help her get better (i.e. building a good social support, seeing a psychologist, taking medication, doing some casual work). What can I do?

"Will medication completely eliminate major episodes? Hi all, I tried googling this but couldn't find anything to answer my question.

Last night my girlfriend with schizophrenia had the worst paranoid episode she's had in a long time.

A little background; she's had the illness about 5 years, i met her in march last year and we got together end of may. She hadn't really had any progress with medication until about June last year because she never took it regularly. Since then she's been taking it as prescribed, and was discharged from being a  outpatient after being in the system since being diagnosed. She has had some minor episodes but last night was the worst one yet. 

It was so bad that now she is scared that it's a signal that she's about to relapse hard and that she'll end up being hospitalised or sectioned. She described it as "" the episode before the storm"".

So I was hoping people with first hand experience could tell me whether they've been through something similar, and if the medication is supposed to eliminate major episodes like that or if they can still happen from time to time. 

I feel like some testimonials from other people with schizophrenia could help put her mind at ease at little or at least confirm that things are about to get bad so we can prepare.",Schizophernia

"How would you best describe schizophrenia in your own words? You can say losing touch with reality, alien taking over body, A group of common symptoms that a person has which were collectively agreed upon psychiatrists and put in the DSM4, Spiritual transformation or something anything you want idk..  try to explain why you describe it that way.. Society has us in a hole and who really can believe anything about anything anymore. When you believe something that is out of touch with reality, what is reality to you? How do you know? Someone tells you, but where does that information come from? How do you trust that person with that information? Could that person be a spy?  I'm just really confused and wish I was instead diagnosed with.. idk... the memories and situations that made me who I am, why I become addicted to things, why I'm afraid of things, my sleep.. people and what they say to me, what they've done to me, how I cognitively analyse my thoughts and which turns I use for certain objects in reality, what they mean to me, why I use metaphors and similes so much... why a lot of the time when I was hearing voices I heard my mom screaming my name.. my desires, inspirations, spiritual beliefs, my mood throughout the day, my reasons for rebelling against authority, what I find to be real and true.. idk..

I need more therapy I suppose but most times my psychologist always challenged my paranoia and delusions.. Invega is a good medication.. helps a lot.. chemical imbalance in the brain? 

I'm still confused about what schizophrenia is because I don't know if I truly can believe the psychiatrist and there's a chance that he could have just been lazy and labelled me as ""schizophrenia"" or could have been lying and apart of some secret formulation of incidences that lead me to clues about something really stupid that I don't care to go deeper into. Different cultures deal with it differently and no culture is ethnocentrically better than another I mean America is just a shopping mall with conspiracies and corruption under a god that doesn't exist unless you take shrooms then you see everything is god. The soul is blablabla it goes round and round. People say this is the only life we will live and there's no afterlife so I hope that's what it is because my trauma is too screwed by what people have said to me and society just buy things. Shiny things. I hate my job and don't know why I'm going to school part time I have no idea what I'm even doing.

"Schizophrenic? ramblings of a guy lost in a small world My opinion (semantics of a naive 21 yr old)

We are victims of intense spiritual warfare, and everyone is to blame. We did it to ourselves...and we are the only ones that can undo it.

If we lose all of the stigmas and learn to trust our spirit guides or angels (higher selves), then we have an unprecedented opportunity to erase the perceived and closely moonitored ""normal"". Everyone has a Jekyll and Hyde personality -- some people just don't understand that Hyde is never necessary. Primitive and violent behavior is the result of constant fight, flight, or freeze \~ which a handful of people have been using to pull strings.

And has now become pop culture (reverse psychology)

Mass hypnotic regression, usually resulting in extremes..(docile and unassuming, or furious and violent).

Humans feed off of negative energy in the same way spirits do. Occult rituals and channeled entities feed off of primarily negative energy (which has subtle, yet physical vibrations). When we are in pain, a lot of people project their anger onto others, in a primitive rage.. instead of using the incredible gift of consciousness. Life is not limited to consciousness, unless consciousness is limited to life.

Several power-hungry individuals have infiltrated our way of life, and corrupted the very essence of what it means to be human. They have committed to becoming vessels for chaos, dictating the political narrative in the shadows. Machiavellianism at its finest... and is consistently ignored by MSM despite the countless people who realize we're slaves in a seemingly fascist world government.

"Going through the worst period in my life Schizotypal, 17, male. Obviously have social problems. The main two are extreme social anxiety and not knowing what to say. The latter going as far as me not having any thoughts 99% of the time. I think I read somewhere else on reddit that this might be from Invega(which I am taking), although I'm not entirely sure.

Let me get to the point.
I am a foreign student in college in the US. I've been here for about one and a half months. I have this awful trait that I easily fall in love with women. I've already had a few crushes(god I hate this word) and this is far more that plain sympathy. I don't have any friends in college. Whenever I simply contemplate talking to someone I don't know, I experience severe anxiety, similar to a panic attack, even stronger that a psychotic episode. 
Now
About a week ago two of the three friends I had back home left me. Because I was ""always 'eating' their free time and always asked for advice which I never used"". One of them told me he would come back when I stopped doing that and found some friends. I also found out from that third friend, which didn't leave me, that the other has no intentions of coming back. I really miss them. I really want them back. I spend most of my time in bed studying, jerking off, or crying to Radiohead(they're fucking amazing, aren't they?).

Yesterday I experienced the worst anxiety in my life, again, when I contemplated talking to people, but this time overcame it. I contacted with three people and was once again convinced that I won't find any new friends, neither will I make my old friends come back. The first guy looked like he was about my age, but turned out to be 26, so I don't think I should even consider this option. I feel I did relatively well, but he didn't seem too interested. Next was my crush. We use the college shuttle at the same time on Tuesday and Thursday, and before that we obviously wait for it at the bus stop. I came over, said ""hi"". She had the most apathetic look I've ever seen. Also, she didn't say anything, so I apologized and left. Next was another girl who also seemed my age, but turned out to be 21. We talked a lot, but I did awful in the conversation. Some awkward silence, but not too much. Sometimes I feel like I don't have a filter. The conversation was so bad that I contemplated suicide for the rest of the day for the first time since September.

Right now, I see two ""barriers"" in getting my friends back. The first is that I am much younger that almost everyone in college, so making friends is going to be almost impossible.
Second is, that as I mentioned earlier, my head is lacking thoughts, so I won't be able to get past small talk, which is also an issue.

"Dealing my thoughts and anxiety and I feel stronger!  

Guys first sorry for my bad English in advance. This is the life I will write which destroyed by anxiety ( Please please get help I wasted my last 17 years. It could be so much better.

So everything started to when I got very very high fever when I was a kid. My parents says my personality changed after that I started to have some odd problems. first I started to shit my pants ( believe it or not I did it untill I was 11) . I pee in my bed in nights and night terors started. My family sent me psychologists and psychologists thought it was the problem about my intelliegence so I got a IQ test when I was 8. and my IQ number was as high as at 12-13 years olds which my family was proud of that when they heard this and stoped to send me psychologists. They probably thought nothing was wrong with me.

My okb started when I was 11, I was obssed the thought that my body does not automatically breathe so I should breathe every second. I started to breathe every second. Then other thoughts started, thoughts that I could never sleep again ( I was sleepless for a long time). However, it did not affect my school and social life a lot, I got good grades and I had friends ( even though I stink really really bad) I had a good sense of humour which helped me to get friends. I had a very very good memeory so it helped me to overcome my studies. However, when I was 16 all my okb thoughts take over me and I lost my personality. Every okb thought take away my personality aspects, let say I was a good basketball player and one okb thought make me feel I was bad, then I could not play it. I used to write good poems and OKB thought started to stop writing poems. I had a very very good memory and one day one thought prevent me from understanding what I am reading.

Depersonalization and cloudy mind started very very heavily and I feel like not myself, so I did not care anything about me. I gained a lot of weight and lost my all friends. Even though I gradauted from an okay university and started to building my life. I am depressed and I am very anxious since I was 16 years old. I am 31 years old now. No one knows that I have okb problem I dont wanna tell my family members. I am married to a lovely lawyer and she earns all our income. I dont work but my family is rich so I dont have a money issue. I am seeing a shrink and I am using prozac 3 times a day. I think it helped to feel like a human again. But still I have a cloudy mind, still feeling depersonalization and I feel very anxious all the time. I FEEL LIKE I AM NOT HERE, I AM IN SOMEWHERe ELSE. I feel like I have no personality.

"Drug use or schizophrenia? Mods, please delete if not allowed, I have no idea where this post belongs.

I don't really know how to help anyone in my family. I feel like most of their problems are extrapolated by drugs use, but I don't know where the drugs end and a mental health problem begins. Please bear with me, I'm obviously ignorant.

My little brother has been on and off drugs (but mostly on) since his early teen years when he started drinking a lot, smoking weed, popping vicodin and norcos. It has escalated to heroin, meth, and fuck if I know what else. He is delusional and homeless. He has had delusions where he believes he is a reincarnation of Ra and the the devil. Much of his delusions have a Devil theme, I think partly due to my older brother (who has used meth or heroin with him often) having a God theme when he was delusional. 


Around 8 years ago my older brother came to visit me. I dont remember the whole experience but I remember him ranting and pacing for hours. It made me physically ill to see him like that and so I've distanced myself from my brothers and sort of given up. I've kept my eyes on them through Facebook, each mirroring Christ/antiChrist themes. Now my older brother has moved away from hard drugs but is dangerously addicted to alcohol: he's not living on the streets but he was living in a tree for a few months this year. In any case, I don't speak with either of them often even though we were close all my childhood. 


I have read that schizophrenia can be due to genetic and environmental markers.  I don't know if his delusions and hallucinations will stop if he stops using. His last and most sober experience he was living with my dad, still smoking weed, and seemed to be in his own world. He would laugh randomly and seemed to be preoccupied with something going on in his head rather than the conversations with the people around him.

I know weed has hallucinogenic properties. I don't know if he likes that or what. It was really hard to talk to him and he would shut down if someone tried to talk to him about his mental state. Granted my mom just cries and has irrational expectations and my father is strict and no-nonsense and has irrational expectations.

My dad, a former meth user, has tried to help them multiple times and my brother has lived with him and occasionally achieved some sobriety though he usually smokes weed during these periods. I think that part of the trouble is that my dad got clean through his faith, old school attitude, and a strict devotion to AA. This clearly will not work for my brother, who, for all I know enjoys being a reincarnation of the devil.

We are poor, the only connection we have to possible help is through my dad and AA but I don't believe this will ever be enough. His options are usually jail or AA type programs. My father and mother firmly believe in the success of 12-step programs and believe it is up to my brother to fail or pull himself out of it. It seems he was able to access drugs the last time he was in jail. I honestly believe they haven't kept him because they probably know he needs medical treatment and do not want to pay for it.

I believe it is unrealistic to expect someone at their lowest point (and spiraling lower) to be able to pull themselves out of this journey to the center of the earth and make it back up to the surface. 

I believe he needs medication, counseling and about 2 years off the streets and in a medically controlled facility. I've not heard of such places for poor white trash and I don't want to see my brother on the news for some horrific crime because there was no help for him.


I've checked, I don't see any help for him. I don't see any options for us. Any ideas?",Schizophernia
"Opening up is dsngerous. Hey guys, 

I'll try to keep this brief. Basically, I have some beliefs that others think are weird and far fetched and irrational. One of my beliefs if that I'm being targeted by the Illuminati and that they'll kill members of my family if I tell people about them and what they're doing to me (following me and such). 

Anyway, I'm in a mental health rehabilitation unit right now and I saw the doctor today who kept asking me questions about things and I ended up opening up a lot more than I would have liked to. Since talking with her, I've felt so vulnerable and anxious and I'm really worried that something bad will happen to my family as a result.

I guess I just need some support. I nearly walked out of the unit to order a taxi to my flat to be on my own and drink, but I know the unit staff would have called the police (because I'm still under a section). 

I don't have access to alcohol, which is what I'd have done in the community, I'd have had a lot to drink to try to calm the anxiety. And I also don't have access to benzos, because they won't prescribe them here. 

I keep thinking to myself ""I'll leave the unit in an hour and go to the shop and buy some alcohol and get a taxi to my flat and just hide away from everyone for the night."" It's the only way I can imagine really being able to sleep tonight. I feel like shit guys. ",Schizophernia
"so i am pretty new to this whole thing my doctor said after how i told her my experiences that brought me to the psych ward that i have probably schizophrenia.
i got the diagnose drug induced psychosis several times now and it always was a similar theme. but now i am several months clean but it just got worse and worse. 
let me get to some of my symptoms: (trigger warning i guess) 

i live on the ground floor of my house and i am utterly terrified by the basement of the building i live in. 
i believe a psychopathic mass murderer is torturing and killing people down there and turning the corpses into fish food.
I've been down there a few times and from a logical perspective nothing speaks for this theory but also nothing against it.
I feel like someone is following me and preparing some kind of ""messages"" for me.
at night time i hear people wailing and screaming from down there and scratches and bumps on the walls and it gives me shivers just thinking about it.
i know that the chance of that actually being true are remarkably low.
but i have no other hallucinations and no other delusions so i am very scared that it might be true.
i have to go home tomorrow to try how i feel at home and go back to the clinic on monday.
i am currently on 1200mg seroquel and have some tranquilizers if i freak out.
oh i forgot about the whole voices thing:
i hear the voice of the ""killer"", my ex best friend and sometimes my parents in my head.
I don't hear them acoustically just in my mind kinda. it's hard to explain...
they say things like: i am going to kill you, we are disappointed, you can't act like you don't like me forever and so on.
it's a very confusing time and i am scared of tomorrow because crazy shit exists and i am really afraid of this fucking basement.

"Not sure of delusions are getting the better of me So last night i was drinking and smoking with a friend from college and he started to get really weird and started playing mind games with me. We had boughten acid and we were supposed to do it today but he accused me of lying to him about how much the acid was. It was $20 which i guess is a lot for acid. This started to really anger me because I wasn't lying and he has no reason to believe I was. After this he started talking about killing me and if he had a gun he could kill me. He was calling me out for being this ""problematic troubled soul"" which I said wasn't true. After awhile I thought this is ridiculous and I said let's go home. So I drove him back and we argued in the car for a really long time about how he didn't say any of that and that he ""loves me so much and that I'm his connection to everything"" this was the last straw for me and it made me think that this guy is an absolute psychopath and he's trying to fucking kill me.

"Is my grandma schizophrenic? Before I begin, I understand a diagnosis cannot be done online. But my grandma will never believe she is sick (if she is) and will never go to a psychiatrist, so I would like to see if I can at least get an understanding of what as going on.

Also, forgive me because I barely have any understanding of what schizophrenia is, so I may give some symptoms that have nothing to do with schizophrenia at all, so sorry about that.

To start, my grandma often tells me about supernatural experiences she as had in her life. She told me about an experience she had in her younger adulthood where a demon manifested itself in her room and tried to suffocate her, before she ripped it off and banished it away. She told me this with complete seriousness in her voice, and I think she 100% believed it to be real. She also told me about an experience where she was in an airplane, and everyone believed the plane was going to crash, but the light of God and a few angels appeared outside her plane window and judged her, and upon hearing her prayers and judging her as a good person they decided to let the plane go. These experiences that she as described have made her very religious, and while I don at think she as lying about how she thinks they are real, I really doubt that they are real.

I think my grandma has also had cases of flat affect. She often sobs or gets incredibly excited when I call her, because we don at get to talk very often and I am the light of her life, but sometimes when I call her she responds in an uncharacteristically monotone and uncaring voice, and the conversation only lasts a minute because she has no interest in keeping it going. However, I am not sure if flat affect is a permanent thing or if it as something that only happens in episodes. She usually doesn at have it, and I ave only seen it with her a few times.

She also has had episodes of depression, and attempted suicide once after which she was hospitalized.

I see her quite rarely (once every few months), and only for 2-3 hours when I do, so it as hard to say if those are her only symptoms. Would you say that those can be schizophrenic symptoms, or schizoaffective or anything like that? Thanks.",Schizophernia

"losing a friend (not dead) this'll be a really long post but i need to write out this whole situation so i can think through my feelings. so, i had this friend who i met my sophmore year of college and we became super, super close. i considered her my best friend and she spent pretty much every day in my dorm room last year. but this year she seems really different. she became an ra over the summer and now all her friends are people who i don't know and don't really care for, mostly other ras. her girlfriend is also an ra. they're always talking about things related to their job that i don't know about. she acts differently too, way more preppy and uptight. she used to be very carefree and snide, which was what i loved about her. she's also always with her girlfriend, who i don't know as well. the gf is nice, but i feel like i can't be myself around her. she never wants to hang out with me because she's either with her girlfriend or busy with her job. the only time i've seen her is at parties and when i'm at a party i like to drink so pretty much she only ever sees me completely wasted these days. it's not that i'm always wasted, it's just that i'm wasted whenever she sees me. 

she reported me to the school for alcoholism even though i'm not alcoholic and i feel super hurt and betrayed. it really triggered my paranoia which hurts all the more because she's one of the few people i trusted enough to tell about my psychosis. so now i have all these people from the school trying to pick apart my personal life and accusing me of things they have no proof of ever happening. i feel crushed by all of this and i never imagined something like this would happen. i'm not in trouble or anything, but i feel betrayed nonetheless because i thought my closest friend would've talked to me before just telling some bureaucracy about some of my most embarrassing moments. i feel like all this time she was just using me as a stepping stone until she found people with fewer problems to hang out with. i'm not the only friend she cut off this year either, which is why i'm saying that. now all her friends are the other ras or the people in her gf's residence hall. it hurts to lose such an amazing friendship but she's not the same person anymore. she doesn't even laugh at my weird/gross jokes like she used to. god, i hate growing up.",Schizophernia

It as similar to if you have a visual hallucination and record it and then you can at see it, because I think this is a new way. Because I got really shook at night when I heard some weird whistling sound which was very quiet but I wasn at sure where it was but then I went into the bathroom and it got louder so I think it was outside but I still wasn at sure how I heard it even when the door was closed and my door was closed too.

"Am I hearing voices? Is this serious? I'm aware that no one here can tell me what is going on with me. I am curious what the opinion of someone who perhaps is more knowledgeable about or has experienced auditory hallucinations is on this. I'm going to go talk to my counselor, because I have been doing pretty bad in school and in life in general.  I think I may be hearing voices.  I'm wondering if I actually am, or I'm just being silly. I feel embarrassed to bring up the possibility, but I'm not sure if this may escalate later, making it better to say something now. 

Probably almost 2 years ago I started to get these thoughts that weren't mine. I'm not a religious person, so I find this strange, but I thought the reason why this was happening was because I was being possessed. There were a few times where they got particularly intrusive and vexing. After a while though I got somewhat used to them and even began taunting them back at times. 

Recently however, they have decided to evolve ,It sound like they are coming from outside my head. I think. I don't know. It's kind of confusing. Their were a couple of times where they got to me. Again, I think. I can't tell if they are real or not. I was walking around outside and when someone starts saying  ""Come here. Come over here."" I got spooked and started walking a little faster. I heard it a few more times and eventually looked up. There was no one following me. On another occasion I was on my way to the kitchen when my dad, so I thought, said ""You're disgusting."" I had no idea why he would say that. I didn't get why he would be so mean. I assumed he was behind me, but again there was no one. I went looking for him and it turns out he was in the garage. 

I really don't want to ,but is this something I should bring up to the counselor? Should I just wait until she appoints me somewhere, and I should mention this to the person there? I've got no one to talk about this to and I've got no clue what to do. ",Schizophernia

I ave been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and panic disorder a while back but it seems that my condition has worsened over the past few years and continues to. For the past week I ave been experiencing something new. Never before have my mental conditions been brought into my sleep. But that as no longer the case. I ave been getting auditory hallucinations. I am also seeing visuals as if I was on LSD. Whilst that all is happening my mind is experiencing very vivid and often terrifying or bad dreams and they are all while I am very lucid. So that as how I am able to dream with my mind separately as the visuals play and I am hearing sounds.

What causes mental illness? Do our thoughts, moods, and behaviours depend upon what we eat?

Psychiatrists  Abram Hoffer and Humphry Osmond met in Saskatchewan in 1951. They set  out to prove that the symptoms of schizophrenia could be controlled with  healthy, unprocessed food and large doses of vitamins. Sixty years  later, it looks like they may have been right.

I am curious if anyone in this community has done LSD and how the hallucinations compare to schizophrenia. LSD usually just makes you see patterns swirling and things like that, nothing major. However, with enough you can have auditory hallucinations as well, and see things that may not actually be there. How close is this to schizophrenia?",Schizophernia
"I need advice: My boyfriend and his schizophrenia. Hi, Reddit. I live with my boyfriend of almost 3 years who has schizophrenia and he's been having more memory issues lately. I think it's always been a problem, but it's getting worse. It has always been a variable depending on his medication. He has been unmedicated for about a year now. He has a tendency to take my clothes- random things that I haven't worn in a while, or take things out of the dirty laundry and hides them. I keep finding things in his usual hiding spots that I check daily (now), but he continually says he doesn't remember doing it and doesn't know why he does it. I've recently found a stash of cups hidden in our room that have gone moldy and gross because they weren't taken to the sink. I'm not sure how long they sat there, but the cups are all ruined. I know that it's just clothes and cups. It's just things. But it feels more personal than that.

Whenever I confront him about it, he says he doesn't remember. After it happens, it's like it's gone forever from his memory. I don't know why and I know I certainly don't understand it. I've been doing some reading about memory loss in people with schizophrenia, and I understand it's an issue. But it's becoming so frustrating finding items of mine that have  been taken and hidden, not having any idea what's happening in-between or the why of it all. 

He was diagnosed a long time ago and I have been diagnosed as bipolar disorder type 2 and bpd for about 2 and a half years. I follow subreddits about each of them to help me understand the struggles that other people with the same diagnoses and how they cope. I am trying to get a better understanding of myself and how my issues are playing into my feelings about the situation. It's incredibly frustrating, but I love him so very much and we've been together for a long time, through some really trying and tumultuous stuff. I, by no means, intend to end the relationship over these frustrating finds, but it's getting harder and harder to be understanding when it continually happens. I feel like I find new things that have been hidden every single day. I have tried appealing to him emotionally, I've cried, I've yelled, I've expressed how upset and frustrated this makes me. But it keeps happening. And I don't know what to do. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to help me with this situation?",Schizophernia

3. gets irritated if he doesnt find the required thing, even for simple things like earphones/headset
4. smiles in between conversation without proper context

"Handful of Tips Let me start this off by saying that I am a 22 year old male, with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Thankfully under proper medication and this is what I do to help myself beyond  perscription.

1. Breathing techniques. Deep, slow inhales and exhales every once in a while. Not trying to get high on air.  Often there is just a tightness in my chest. So to fight that I will breathe heavily a few times, just enough to ease the mind.
2. Meditation. It is difficult to keep things quiet, and it feels easiest to do in the morning. Couple that with stretching and it will ease the body as well. More often than not it is impossible to meditate in my room so I recommend going outside, and close your eyes and try and focus on consistent breathing. In the mouth and out the nose, or vise versa.
3. Time outdoors. Everyone needs fresh air and at times and it feels good to go on a walk. Getting some sun goes along with that, replenishing vitamin D3. It has a feeling of bringing life into you. Keep that in mind for spring/summer.
4. Friends. Having too many friends can cause some stigma, like coming into delusions. We already are antisocial to begin with, so holding on to people is something I try to stay away from. Though an SO or pet helps greatly from what I have heard.
5. Thinking. Holding on to things that seem so real that it is hard to let go of. Choose the path of least resistance, holding on to these thoughts can cause stronger hallucinations. Everything should blow over with time.
6. Reading. It can help keep thoughts organized, and your mind busy at something more important and interesting. It will keep you sharp too, after school and reading another book it brought a good feeling in to life. Ready to seize the day again!
7. Music. Calming music like jazz or instrumental music gets all the hyping up these outlandish thoughts and will ease the mind. Spotify has many playlists for relaxation, plus the quality is superb.
8. Hobbies. Always have one, reading can be coupled with this one. Art is an outlet that is all over this sub, there are so many beautiful exposes of this life on here. Writing is another good one. Even just keeping a journal can take a load off.
9. Exercise. This is a big one for your mind to be happy the vehicle it drives should be kept up with. Multivitamins made a real impact on my life, in a positive way. Personal routine.. 10 pushups + 10 calve raises upon waking up. (Good way to start the day)
10. Food. A study was recently found that schizophrenia is affected by gut bacteria. So eating less food helps the hallucinations go down, which I did not believe. I fasted for a day and had nearly no hallucinations or delusions and a great day of work on top of that. Snacking around is a good way to go.

I hope this can help anyone who is struggling, life is a roller coaster and the ride can be less bumpy if you pick some of these up. I have had my entire world light up because of this sub. Much love!",Schizophernia

I dropped 40lb, lowered my cholesterol, and am getting better with regards to my psychosis. I specify that I follow primal because it means that I don't eat vegetable oil or any other unnatural foods. I typically eat tuna &amp; sardine salad made with avocado oil mayo for lunch. So, I am covering all my bases by increasing omega 3 as well as eliminating processed food.


As far as exercise goes, I run long distances at a low-effort level. This took time to get to a reasonable pace and had to start out simply by walking to maintain the target heartrate that I follow (180-my age: 147bpm).

I hope all of you are doing well and are progressing towards health. If you're interested in hearing more about my diet and exercise you can message me, but to avoid being too preachy I am not going to give any other details here.",Schizophernia

"What happens when you skip a med for one day or two/three days? What do you feel mentally or physically? I'm just trying to understand what my brother goes through. He isn't particular about taking his meds and seems to lie about it from time to time.

There are days where when I ask him something, he just stares at me blankly before asking ""huh?""and I have to repeat myself. I have gone on to realize that it tends to happen when he is not regular on meds or may have skipped a day or two.

"How would I be able to tell if I am having a psychotic break? What does the onset of an episode feel like before the episode happens? Apologies for formatting, I am on my phone at work. I have had one episode about a decade ago when I was in a very different phase of life and was pushing myself and making a lot of unhealthy choices that I am sure contributed to the situation. That as not the case now, I ave become a pretty boring guy in an effort to not have any more episodes. I still go out for drinks sometimes but I can pass as a normal (if somewhat awkward and poor at speaking) dude and have been this way for almost ten years.

However, I ave felt pretty off lately. I don at think it as panic attacks as I am well versed in those and this is different, there as no adrenaline or fast heartbeat or overwhelming fear feeling, it as mostly just that something about the world feels very off, like there as something wrong with it. When my girlfriend asked me to describe it, I told her it feels like when you are in the forest for hours by yourself in dead silence and your mind starts to make you think you are hearing people laughing or drums beating or a baby crying somewhere in the distance when in reality it as probably just birds or cicadas, and it as starting to get dark and then you start seeing shit and the whole world feels real sinister. I spent a lot of time in the backwoods of Vermont growing up and I ave had this feeling in the woods all my life. 

For the past 2-3 months I ave been getting this in public, at work, when I am hanging around downtown, in my home, pretty much everywhere but my car. I keep feeling like I am being watched or followed. I haven at had any real hallucinations but it feels way darker than it should be. Visually I feel like I am looking at a screen with the brightness turned all the way down most of the time. My optometrist says my eyes are fine. 

Does this sound like something to watch out for or does it sound more like general anxiety? Also for future reference, what should I be expecting for if this ever does come back, what would it feel like?",Schizophernia
"Medication Free Cure Drink distilled water. Start at Walmart. Then get a distiller. I had it bad, I don't have It at all anymore. Negligence is poisoning you. It's need to know. Now you know. If you don't switch to distilled water and organic food you are choosing to stay sick.  
  
Anyone who claims they are already doing that is either a liar with an agenda or being lied to themselves. It takes time to heal but real water and real food will cure you no meds needed. The only side effect is that you'll realize that your country doesn't care for you unless you care for yourself which is honestly ok.

All this being said i still think the neighbors are real people and my friend knows we can communicate over long distances by using mental powers and he's just lying because he doesn't want to ruin the good life he's built for himself by drawing attention over these communication superpowers.

I see my psychiatrist tomorrow, I finally found one who is real, i dont feel like my meds are working, but thats ok, ill tell doctor about it. 

I am in an Outpatient Treatment therapy group i like it but i am worried what is next after wards. The therapist is very nice and she is awesome, she is one person that believes i hallucinate, a lot of people dont. I no longer self medicate, which is good.

"How vividly do you visualize? Just to disclose, I don't have schizophrenia. I do have a condition called aphantasia. I do not visualize at all, technically no imagination, no mind's eye. Most likely related is my lack of episodic memory. 

Voluntary visualizing (as opposed to hallucinations or dreaming) exists on a scale, some people see movie like moving images in their mind, some faded static images, or like me, nothing at all. I was curious if there was a pattern in this community. How well do you visualize? Are there many here with either hyperphantasia (very vivid visualizer) or aphantasia?

"Advice for using CBD for Schizophrenia My sibling has been suffering from schizophrenia (to be more specific  schizoaffective) since she was 17.

"Insatiable Hey Guys.

I have a problem food. I was tiny as a child, have been big when I was on meds, but after stopping, I had a very restrictive diet to control the worst symptoms and became quite small again. The past year, I managed to actually do university. The stress is overwhelming and I've been having eating problems, really bad again.

That is.. I try to restrict myself, then I binge. Bad. I eat and eat, untill I hurt. I am constantly hungry. I don't remember the feeling of satisfaction. I just want to continue untill I cannot move, untill every inch of my body hurts. I eat healthy, I don't eat processed food. I don't eat much sugar. I don't understand what I do wrong..

Is this maybe a delusion or a tactile hallucination?  Do you experience this? It's not just a little stress eating. It's constant thoughts of eating and food. I feel constantly really hungry. I feel my stomach rumbling, I feel my body aching in hunger. I have been eating for 2 hours, I feel icky, but I feel like Ive had a long days work and need dinner.

"Fear of having Schizophrenia So it all started last december when i smoked weed and got a panic attack. during the attack i thought that time is very slow and that im in a dream and would never snap out of it. Thankfully i was okay next morning. After 15 days anxiety kicked and i eventually developed depression. my depression was all around not being able to function properly because of the anxiety. during this period the 'dream' thing came back and start to question the realty of everything. i started to ask questions like ""what if youtube is not real "", ""what if my mother is not real and im just imagining"". SO i met a psychaitrist who diagnosed me with anxiety and obsession and prescribed me fluoxtine 20mg risperidone 1mg and clonazepam .25 mg. by this time i had googled a lot and did a mistake(which i regret a lot) of searching risperidone online, after that i read almost all articles, websites and watched almost all videos on schizophrenia on youtube, after which i began to suspect everything i hear and see to confirm im not hallucinating ,causing me a lot of distress. Later one day i was showering and thought ""what if im in a game and everyone else is just programmed and my actions are just keystrokes by someone"" i quickly related this which schiz symptom and medication i was taking and start to feel the control. it stayed around 15 minutes but i ignored it and it faded away.

fast forward to today. Now im living in constant fear of having schizophrenia, I do not hear or see anything extra, i do not have any delusion. I always try to calm myself down by talking rationally to myself that i do not have schizophrenia but the second moment i doubt it by thinking ""What if i do have schizophrenia but since im taking medications for it i not experiencing any symptoms"",""If you didnt had schizo then doctor wouldnt have prescribed me"". My greated fear is schizophrenia. please tell me its just anxiety and the medication is for something else.",Schizophernia

"I need some validation  So my brother just came back to my moms house all of a sudden. It has been 10 years since I have seen him. He was 18; now he as 28. 

I am glad that he decided to visit, and I ask him how he as been doing. He just goes on talking about his Star Trek game and how he has been fishing. Then he goes on about how he got some man put on house arrest for some reason. 

I got bored of conversation, and I had to go. So I did, but the next day I hear from my mother that he as now moving in. Not really a surprise because my other siblings do this constantly. He gets all his stuff and brings it here. Everything seems fine and dandy.

Friday I get a text from my mom at 5 AM. It said, Hi sweetie can you walk over later kerstie and i really really need you. I was too busy then and it was WAYYY too early. After I got done my therapy appointment at 4 PM, I went to my mom as and a lot just happened then and there. 

I see my brother sitting on the daybed out in the living room with his hands in the praying position but pointing away from him in a death stare. Mumbling lots of things that I cannot comprehend. I go to my room and he just walks in without knocking or anything; and he just has my nieces pacifier in his mouth. What am I supposed to fucking do....I just laughed. Because I think it as funny? But I didn at want to humiliate him. So I didn at laugh after that. My mom yells at him for having it in his mouth when he goes into her room. He also kept talking to himself when no one was around.  

My mother and father think he as doing this to them on purpose; they are fucked up in the head as well. 

Today I went over there because I needed something to eat and I needed to buy bud (I don at have a car). He was alright when I came in he was just acting like he was sleeping. I go into my parents room to chat with them. He ends up coming in to talk with us. Then he starts doing the praying thing again. My dad tells him to knock it off. In my head I am thinking being mean doesn at solve this. I ave even told them this and they said that he would act like this (not as bad but as a child) when they first got custody back of him when he was 14. 

They believe drugs did this to him, but I do not think that entirely. I told them he should be evaluated, but they don at want to put him on meds. Because it screwed him up in the first place. But when my mom went to check the mail, he was sitting in a baby pack and play praying. My mom just yelled so loud, never heard anything like it. Telling him to get out and that he is not a child. He wouldn at get out, so she flipped him out it! I ave never seen that strength from her, over him being a child? Too much...She comes back out a second time and I follow her. He is out there on the bed COMPLETELY NAKED and he PISSED THE BED. My parents were ballistic; yelling at him to get his clothes back on. I told them to take him to get evaluated or I am calling the crisis hotline and having someone take him. Because he cannot be around these toxic fucking people. He needs help very badly.

"Should I see a doc? This is my first time of reddit so please forgive me  Hi. My name is Mike, I'm 17, and I would like advice. If anyone thinks I should see a therapist or something please tell me, I could just be paranoid thanks to my love of horror. 
It's very hard to explain the things that I've been going through for, I believe is a few years, but I'll try. 
There are many times when I'm convinced someone is watching me. I know it's a generic story, but when I think about it, I'm paranoid to no end. 
And it's been happening for so long that I've convinced myself everything weird that happens is just their fault and it's normal. 
There's sounds I'd hear, for an example, like just today it was buzzing noises, almost like a phone buzz. These noises were coming from my bedside table, which is completely empty. This is just one example of many, and I'm well aware I maybe thinking to too much into this. 
I turned off the video I was watching so I could hear the buzzing better and the buzzing just stopped. So I turned my video back on. Then the buzzing happend again, video off, no buzzing. The noise wasn't coming from my phone or the video I can promise that. I turned off my phone and listened for a good five minutes and then shrugged it off. I'd tell myself it was the person (who's watching me) doing it and it was normal. Or that it was part of my imagination. Which I'd believe if stuff like that didn't happen all the time.

"Got diagnosed schizophrenia. Of course I am not asking reddit to diagnose me. More like does my symptons sound any familiar to people who are diagnosed with schizophrenia.  
 
I don't hear sounds or hallucinate in general. But I can't control my own thoughts. My own thoughts would bombard me constantly with suicidal thoughts and other very nasty ideas 24/7. I learned to live with this for many years. I always listened to music at high volumes to drown out my own thoughts. I have been having mild panic attacks when I am around people. Doing groceries and stuff. It would be feel like people are staring me. This is what I thought to be anxiety.

   
Around 4 months ago my friend finally got me to see a psychiatrist who diagnosed me with depression. I got prescibed prozac. I can't even remember the last time it was this quiet in my own head. Prozac worked but it also made me not care about anything which resulted in my financial situation failing and generally everything else went for worse too. I met the psychiatrist again this time I got diagnosed for schizophrenia. I am not sure if this is misdiagnosis that's why I am here.   
   
 I am now on haloperidol. My thoughts are more controlled and I don't get panic/anxiety attacks in grocery store. But the side effects of haloperidol are very nasty. I actually went off my dose for some time but I got a good tip to half my dosage. My original presciption was 1-3mg a day. But taking 1mg at time would cause my body be really restless. I couldn't focus on anything or stay still at all. It's very nasty feeling. I am no taking 0.5mg when I wake up and 0.5mg later in the day and the side effects are much more controlled.    
    
Does this sound anything like a schizophrenia? It is a bit hard pill to swallow being schizophrenic. As I have had this for many years now. It's a good thing I finally got to see a doctor but I am unable to go see psychiatrist again as I don't have money.",Schizophernia

"Zyprexa experiences I was put on Zyprexa earlier last year for schizoaffective psychosis and dissociative personality. I remember it helping quite abit. My memory is also extremely bad. I got off of it around September of last year because I moved and didnt have a new psych to prescribe to me again. And around Thanksgiving I was placed in inpatient because I had a mental break complete loss of touch with reality. Hallucinations psychosis all of it. They gave it to me again and then again I stopped taking it... I have an appointment with a neuro psych in about a week and a half. And I did alot of research and decided I'd like to stay on zyprexa. But I really dont remeber being this tired... I also use to be on adderall to stop the insatiable hunger and drowsiness. I remember it working well together. I also took neurontin and vistaril. 
However now even at 10mg I am so BEYOND tired like I dont remeber being this tired?? And adderall isnt helping at all. I took it at midnight. Fell asleep at 1am. Woke up at 1pm... couldn't move... woke up again at 3.. couldn't move. Then at 6pm I forced myself awake. Took 15mg adderal. I felt like a zombie. I fell asleep at 10pm and now here I am awake at 1am. I've felt really calm and at ease and generally good. But this comma sleep I have no idea what to do about it I'm getting nothing done at all.

"Are the inner voices similar to thoughts? Sometimes I hate how much I think. I always think way too much about the simplest things and come to odd conclusions, I think there is a special hidden meaning behind things that I found out, but then I intrusively keep on thinking about it and keep changing my minds about it. Those thoughts are however also filled with overthinking about general anxieties and then I often have this strong inner monologue about what other people would comment to my thoughts.

Personalities that I know from real life start to comment on my thoughts with either validating responses to my assumptions or invalidating ones where in I hear those persons discuss about me. The thoughts seen to somewhat make sense to me but then the next day I might come to the conclusion that I am just paranoid. But then I am really concerned about it and overthink it further..

All of this started when I started to get bad social anxiety from a slow and painful anxiolytic withdrawal to a point where I often dissociated badly for months, and I started isolating myself. Because of dissociation I couldn at understand my surroundings that well so I started the habit of thinking about what people could have said or meant after I was done dissociating in public, when being by myself. Especially after smoking weed it instantly triggered those thoughts.

Could this be any indication for schizophrenia? I definitely have the negative symptoms but I am unsure if that inner monologue is just overthinking and anxiety, or if it could be considered as voices talking to me which is seen with schizophrenia.

"Been having trouble making it to class lately I haven't been horribly truant but I've already missed so many damn classes. I'm at the ""absent to three classes and your eligible to get dropped"" thing now for one of my classes and I'm en route to be there for two others also. It's not as if I'm doing anything important, and I don't even actually hate being at school that much I almost always enjoy class when I'm finally there. Just the cycle of unmotivated, depression, panic, and then complacency when it's time for class to start and I'm still at home kills me. 

I think deep down I really don't want to do school. The problem is that it's the thing that I've always been known for. Ever since I was a kid I'm the 'smart' one and all that and I've dedicated my entire life to doing well in class and learning a lot, even going way beyond the call of duty doing university during high school. Now I'm 18 years old in my junior year of university and I get such high praise and love from everyone I meet because of that. It means nothing to me. Class is interesting and all and I genuinely enjoy philosophy and french, but there is something that I want more out of life than school all the time. I don't know what that something is. I feel like if I were to do something other than school I'd just default to playing games and reading books all day as a useless depressed sack of potato.

They sat down and she was being quite loud so I looked over for a second instinctively and he shouted at me. I just ignored him and went back to my music. Over the next half hour, however, I heard him muttering to his girlfriend about me. They were sitting maybe 5 seats in front of me, so I couldn't hear too well. He got up after a while to, I'd assume, use the toilet, and when he walked past me he was glaring at me and even leered at me.

I do work in a community regarding safety & have earned the trust of a diagnosed schizophrenic lady. She is very meek, and has been suffering symptoms such as: paranoia, hallucinated voices (having full on conversations) and looking like she's been having a hard time being at peace in the community.   


She hasn't always been one to go out much, but feels like she has been forced to, due to the belief that she is being tortured by people choking her, making it hard to breathe, and causing general discomfort around her neck. She's told me that she believes that mobile devices are the main source of how people are choking her.   

She knows I listen to her, and feels comfortable enough to have conversations with the voices in front of me.   


She'd recently expressed one of the voices in her head wants her to commit suicide, so I had brought it to my boss's & her boyfriends attention.   


She keeps asking me to help her, and I know that she needs professional help- but from what it seems, she stopped taking her symptom management meds & dismisses my opinion that the difficulties she's been having can only be helped by a doctor.

Would anyone be able to give me some advice on what would be beneficial to do when encountering this lady? My heart goes out to her, and I feel like one of the only people left in the community that isn't annoyed by her existence.

Help? Any insight?? Im worried im developing schizophrenia. I smoked weed for a few months in 2016. Then i had a panic attack while high off weed in 2017. The whole time during the attack i was thinking to myself that i was hallucinating everything and that i had lost my mind. But it was really happening. But I thought it wasnt real. After that i felt hazy for a few weeks. After that i had panic attacks. But i started doing more and getting out more and i didnt have one for about 11 months ! i still had anxiety alot tho but it seemed like it got better. Then i got arrested and took a huge loss. After the arrest i had 3 panic attacks. The first one i had sent me into feeling detached which i still have. I sit at home alot because ive lost my car so i have to rely on other people. I still hang out with friends. I still hang with my girlfriend and we still have sex. I still cook for her and play with my nieces. I still shower and eat. But i keep having intrusive thoughts and stuff. I also have a ringing in my ear and i am having cluster headaches. I also sometimes feel like a tiny crawling on my legs or neck sometimes. Ive been feeling really detached. I have intrusive thoughts that what i may be hearing is a hallucination and that i might be losing it. For example ill hear an airplane outside and think what if im hallucinating or i might hear birds chirping and think it as hallucination. Then i ask my parents and they tell me they hear it too. Imagine feeling like that almost all day. I read that it starts with cluster headaches and panic attacks and skin crawling hallucinations and feelings if detachment. I started trying 5htp. Idk if it works or not. The other night i had a horrible realistic nightmare that i had lost my mind and nobody would help me. I know i should talk to a doctor but i just wanted to know if anybody could provide insight. Im 19 and I turn 20 in a couple months. I know it shows up in your 20s.

"CDR in a country in another part of the world? Hello, im in Bulgaria, that is in Eastern Europe, north of Greece for instance. When i was approved for SSDA back in 2017 was a huge thing for me, 34 years old male, 8 years work experience as a driver in Bay Area. When i got psychotic - understand Schizophrenic i had to leave my american dream and fly back in poor, old Bulgaria. Had multiple non voluntary hospitalizations in the local psych ward in my town here. During my stay there, apparently SSA denied my claim on the basis of not supply them with medical documentation from hospitals in the US.

Then the Autumn of 2015 i got a call from US Embassy in Athens, asking me if i still want to apply for disability. I said yes, sure i want. The workers from the embassy sent me the forms over email, i filled them scanned and send them back, alongside with copy of my still un expired green card, Bulgarian ID, and birth certificate. 

It took 1 year and half for them to decide i am disabled and only after they asked my psychiatrist to write down what are my limitations, because the regular health paperwork was not saying conclusively that i am disabled, at least Gina from the Embassy told me that stuff. And i had at least 7 hospitalizations with 20 days each of it. 

Recently i got the back pay for that disability and i invested it in an appartment, half of the cost of the appartment is all my back pay. Of course i am paying half of my monthly pension to cover the rest of the amount for this appartment. The building is going to look nice with shops, restaurants etc. and is expected to be completed in the summer of 2020, for me to be able to move in, a year later due to the payments.

But then it comes the uncertainty: my CDR is due 2020 April, at least thats when i was awarded but in 2017. I no longer have valid green card, but as far as i know, the only reason, that i am a Bulgarian citizen and our country has disability system that could pays to Americans, then i can continue collect my disability no matter how much time i will be out of the US. Obviously i am never coming back, since i was silly enough not to apply for naturalization back in the days. 

I am having my visits in the psychiatrists cabinet, lately for personal and emotional problems. We take notes with whats going around my life, the psychiatrist is doing verry good job, as she knows how i need that pension to continue be my steady income. We never completed an RFC sheet with her, and now my fears are, what if the RFC report DDS do on the CDR, shows that i am not eligible to be disabled anymore. Then all this thing i was hopping with my parents to become independent of them, having my own place, taking my meds and live a litle bit better in terms of how an average Bulgarian can live in that economic situation, you know. Its scary when in any moment they can stop paying you, what are my options in that case.... i just have to go kill myself, there is no other viable option.

Anyway i dont want to sound like that, i prefer to be prepared, proactive, and the Embassy told me that, they will get in touch with me for that CDR, but will they? Or just English Greek Bulgarian lost in translation here.

Thanks for taking the time understanding my life as how i see it now.

"I love you guys Hey, I was a user who was very active a lot a couple of years ago on this sub. I wanted to just say this is the most supportive internet community I've ever been in! Everyone here is understanding and awesome, even when we disagree about treatment. I'm actually writing my thesis on how the US health insurance industry limits treatment options for people with severe disabilities through private insurance. At the end of May, I'll have a beautiful poster to show all of you about my findings.

It's so hard to have schizophrenia, especially in a country with private insurance. We are constantly silenced because we are considered to be a danger by virtue of our illness. 50% of mental hospital beds in the US are filled by people with schizophrenia, and 33% of people on medicaid have a mental illness. It's pretty grim out there. Learning more about health statistics has shown me how far I've come, and you should be comforted knowing that no matter where you are in life, the majority of schizophrenic people are so shunned from medical care that 90% of us have a chance of an emergency hospitalization due to psychosis within a 10 year period (as opposed to 40-60% for other severe illnesses like PTSD, or depression. The only other illness that even approaches this level is anorexia which is literally life threatening on its own). Only 2% of schizophrenic people obtain an education beyond high school.

This should not be the way that American schizophrenics live. We deserve a level of treatment that doesn't bring us to absolute desperation for emergency help. We shouldn't be so stigmatized that what is clearly a larger social problem is blamed on individuals.",Schizophernia

"I've realized I've been making schizophrenia my life. I've gotten better to the point that I have a job and made some friends and can handle my symptoms, but after talking with a co-worker, I realize I've sometimes been focusing on how I'm schizophrenic and not on me as a person. For example, lately I've been talking about my illness as an excuse. I realize now I shouldn't put myself in a box and should just focus on me as a person, not an illness.",Schizophernia
"Feeling very anxious really need some advice, not sure if onset or not Okay so I think a good place to start is I ave started to feel the symptoms of depression and anxiety roughly 5-6 months ago which made sense since I ave had a lot of trauma from my parents when I was young and had suicidal thoughts since I was 12 (20 yr/old currently)
And I started taking lexapro 20mg

One night when I was drunk on my own wallowing in my own sadness a personal problem with a friend made me feel very angry and betrayed and I kept thinking about this all night and couldnt go to sleep cause my mind was racing so I go through the morning hungover and when I got to therapy I could barely focus on the conversation and I found it hard to speak as well, where I had to recap a few times so she could understand what I was saying, I ended it early and I had this huge agitation and I was so depressed as well I felt like I had to chill for a bit in my car so I don at have any suicidal tendencies while driving. While driving I had this constant agitation and stress which I haven at experienced anything like it and I had this thought that I was going insane cause I never felt this depressed and anxious before at the same time. My brother was diagnosed with schizophrenia and I know there as a better chance to get diagnosed if a sibling has the disorder this is the first warning sign I had but could be sleep deprivation.

 A few days later I couldn at shake that suspicion of having schizophrenia from before so I looked up symptoms of it and what made it so scary was a good amount of symptoms from depression can be found in schizophrenia and I became paranoid on some other symptoms of schizo that I didn at have. I began to observe how I walked made sure I walked normal which I never have before and would wonder do I have an emotionless expression right now which I easily could have or not and sometimes if I walk slightly awkwardly for a few seconds I would start to get a lot of anxiety. I am sorry if this offends anyone I don at mean anything bad by it. Also I ave had less motivation for schoolwork which could be depression as well but I still pull good grades but I end up staying up till 1-2am to finish tasks.

Next one night after getting home from drinking/hanging with friends I was already in a sad/depressed state so I decided to drink more almost to a blackout state. And my mom got these fancy sharp kitchen knives and I was so sad at one point I contemplated slitting my wrists just staring with the knife on my wrist but I only ended up cutting myself slightly as a bad outlet for my emotions. In the morning I regretted what I did and remembered self harm was something that someone schizophrenic may do and I started freaking out yet again at some points I would admit to myself that I could be.

Now I feel as if my memory is a lot worse than it has been, I could only remember my entire last 5 days of the week. But for roughly the last 5 days when I would try to go to sleep I my mind would race and I would have thoughts come and go, some depressing others just random and I am not sure if they are mine or not. I would have images pop up in my head at this time too, some pornographic, some related to videogames, others just relating to my day and this made it very hard to fall asleep like I couldn at shut them off and would fall asleep 30-45 minutes later. On the weekends I drank more so I would wouldn at have to deal with those thoughts and just fall asleep immediately, but tonight I found it hard to judge if I could hear those thoughts when I was trying to sleep and there was one I heard for the first time rather faintly, it was the sound of my brother saying (insert my name here) is gay! I could tell it was my brother but I never heard him say that to me so it wasn at a replay of a memory. I am freaking out right now and I haven at been able to get much sleep the past 1-2 weeks because this happens, I drink heavily on weekends as well (almost blacking out) like three times a weekend cause I just don at like myself or my life right now. If you guys could lend any insight that would be great and I am thinking about going to get tested for it soon. Any feedback is appreciated.

"As I get older and older, I realize that chances of me finding love slips further and further away. The paranoia, delusions, and constant intrusive thoughts I have make simple relationships feel like the hardest feat imaginable. It's like it's impossible for me to just accept and enjoy the present. All the negative things mentioned above make doing so far beyond impossible to the point where I'm just sitting here contemplating whether I'd be happier alone for the rest of my life. But I don't want that... I want to love someone who loves me similarly. I want the two of us to be each others everything and never doubt that for as long as we live. Yet the second I meet someone, my head rewires my thinking into something that depresses me. The excitement and interest in a girl slowly dissipates into extreme jealousy, paranoia that she's using me, that she's making fun of me, that she doesn't like me even remotely, that she's cheating whenever I'm not by her side... God I sound like such a psycho boyfriend type but I'm not! I know these things are dumb so I suppress them until I can't do it anymore and have to stop talking to this person I once really liked.. I'm on a good medicine that helps tremendously with voices, hallucinations, and delusions to some extent, but when love is involved it's like my brain flips the ""You don't deserve this"" switch and destroys me from the inside out..

"About to hike 2,200 miles I think I can do it.

On March 24th, my bestfriend, my dog, and I will be departing from Springer Mountain, Georgia, and hiking northbound on the Appalachian Trail. End goal is Mount Katahdin, Maine.

I ave wanted to hike the Appalachian Trail since I learned what it was at 10 years old. It as been at the forefront of my mind ever since. For the past two-ish years, I had slipped into a state where I felt nothing at all. Not symptomatic, not happy, not sad, not really anything at all. This did allow me to start and finish an academy I had been interested in and I ave had a stable job in that field while volunteering in it on the side for the past seven months. This allowed me to shovel away the rest of the money I needed for the trail, although I didn at really have any conviction to do it anytime soon.

One thing led to another, and an amazing opportunity opened up back in December, that would allow me to hit the trail this Spring. I told my best friend and we took it, him excited as hell, and me a bit disappointed that I didn at care as much as I should, but confident that I could knock it out in my apathetic state.

I woke up one morning in late January and I was normal. Symptoms aren at terrible, but they are here, I am STOKED about starting a six month adventure of a lifetime, and I am sad as hell about leaving my girlfriend and my mom. I feel like I went to sleep with my life a psychotic disaster at 19 and woke up at 21 locked into a career and weeks away from walking across up the country. Feeling like I am, I am not totally sure I all have the guts to finish it when things get tough, but on the other hand, I know Brett will not let me give up on this.

"Schizophrenics of Reddit, did you personally frequently use cannabis or other drugs, especially at an early age? Hello all,

I hope you are all doing okay. I am sorry for not being able to relate to you 100% because I myself do not suffer from the illness (as of now, at least) but my mom does. 

Her mom didn at have schizophrenia, and she never knew her father. However, she had me when she was 16, and after that regularly engaged in dangerous activities, such as frequent LSD use, PCP use, Stim use, etc. She also did smoke weed extremely often, and studies now are showing that smoking weed chronically or at an early age can affect the onset of the disorder.

So with that being said, was cannabis a part of your daily routine? Did you have a schizophrenic parent yourselves and you resorted to things like marijuana to cope, and eventually ended up with the disorder yourself?

"How dangerous is it to be off meds and in denial? I have no experience with schizophrenia. 

I found out recently that a person in a board game group with me was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. Our group gets together once in a while at each other's places, but it's usually at my place, since I'm the most central. 

This person found our group through Meetup recently. He always acted a little differently and sometimes made me uncomfortable, but I chalked it up to quirks and took steps to make sure I was safe (like making sure I was never alone with him, etc.). But recently he divulged to the group that he was homeless, ""misdiagnosed"" with paranoid schizophrenia (I have since learned that denial is a symptom), jobless, and estranged from family and friends. He also proclaimed that he was not on medication because he feels he was misdiagnosed and that the medical community conspired to retain that diagnosis. 

I did some research and found out that he lost his job and home because of threatened violence, including gun violence, when he stopped taking his medication.

I feel terrible for him, and from what I'm reading, community is a healthy and important part of recovery. I'd be happy to continue providing him that community, but I'm genuinely concerned and would love your input. 

How common is it to have a violent episode when you're not on medication? Are there signs I can look for to help identify potential danger? How long do episodes last, usually?

He is a nice dude and I don't want to make him feel worse, but it's also important to me to keep everyone safe. I'm trying to get informed before making any decisions, and I'd appreciate you helping with that if you can. ",Schizophernia

Sometimes they talk to eachother, sometimes they talk to me, sometimes I can at make out what they are saying or only bits and pieces, sometimes they talk about me (99% of the time when they are talking about me it as about what I am doing or is something usually negative/sometimes neutral/ and very rarely positive about me. I know that people probably wouldn at talk about me 24/7 but in a sense I know my actions and what I say seem weird to some people so I can see people talking about what I am doing if they are bored or whatever and people are just plain mean sometimes so it doesnt seem that far fetched to think it might be true.

"HELP! I love someone with schizophrenia, who is estranged from his family and homeless, and I don at know what to do. Someone I love dearly has been struggling with schizophrenia for years. However, after his dad died, he got exponentially worse, had a psychotic break, stopped taking his medicine, and became violent and verbally abusive to all of his loved ones.

Long story short, he has destroyed his relationships with his family. All of his surviving family members are women, and they verge on being afraid of him. He has never actually hurt anyone, but he did go to jail for breaking and entering while having a psychotic break. 

His family has tried and tried to get him to go back on medication, go to therapy, find a job, or apply for disability. He gets outraged by the idea that he can at work. Beneath this horrible illness, there is a wonderful, loving, and supportive person who cannot bear the idea of being unable to financially contribute the way he wants to. When he refused to do any of those things, his family finally kicked him out. 

Two nights ago, he allowed an audience with me over Facebook messenger (he hadn at spoken to me in a year, after he ad gone to jail and his condition became untenable) and confessed he was on the street.

I found him in a more miserable condition than I could ave imagined. He was living in a broken manhole. He is so traumatized by how cruel others have been to him when he asks for help that he won at panhandle, or ask for food, and he as emaciated. I believe he is experiencing ??negative symptoms and disassociation. He was cognizant of how miserable the conditions were, and thanked me tearfully and vociferously for getting him out of there for just one night, but he seemed resigned to going back there, even when I offered to pay for a month of his staying at a homeless shelter. 

Tonight, he as at the shelter, but he refused to stay there for any length of time. I am afraid to push the issue of medication for fear that he all extricate me from his life again. I am all he has right now. I have been talking to his sister all evening and she and their mother are absolutely bereft. 

He is severely delusional, but only in spurts. I spent all day with him, and it was like my friend flickered in and out. After a while I deduced he responded well to humor, and just played into his wild tangents so at least we could laugh together. He wasn at at all offensive or harmful just absent from reality. He didn at seem to be experiencing any present auditory or visual hallucinations he just got lost in tangents of thought, like making connections between road signs we were seeing and obscure events from our past. 

Please help. He could disappear on me so easily. I am scared to immediately try to force the issue of medication or hospitalization when I haven at been around to see the illness progress to this extent. Please advise me on the best method for persuading or forcing him to GET HELP post haste.

i've found that, through these 2 years, i've had to apologise almost every day, in whatever degree, for my illness.

i hope this is OK to post here,

but i've been making videos surrounding the topic of schizophrenia,

my most recent about having to apologise for seeing the things we see, hearing the things we hear, or doing the things we do.

"Getting Better but Feel Like It's Worse I've made a lot of progress on my issues and the underlying things that trigger and worsen my schizophrenia. I used to go catatonic when I was psychotic, just frozen in fear and subject to everything in my head. I don't get scared anymore. I get angry instead. It's good in a way, because it's progress in my issues. But it makes me feel awful because my boyfriend is often the target of it, just because he's the one who's around me the most. I hate getting so angry with him, because I know I'm not angry at him. It's irrational and doesn't make sense but I can't help but feel like I have to fight in those moments. He's the one who keeps saying it's progress, as I don't remember my psychotic episodes very much, just the emotions. He says he thinks I'm trying to stand up for myself in those moments, which is better than being frozen in fear when everything overcomes me. It just hurts him. He says as soon as I see he's genuinely hurt, I snap out of it and try to comfort him. For me it's in those moments that I realize he's not in the reality that I'm fighting against, that he's not them (the abusers in flashbacks, the voices, the hallucinations in general), and I can stop fighting and yelling at him. I just always feel so awful afterwards though because I hate hurting him like that. I don't know what to do to get through this phase of the progress. Maybe it'll just take time, but I'm scared I'll push him away before them. He's so kind and understanding, I don't know how he does it. I love him so much and I don't want to lose him, but I'm so much of a burden already, with this on top of it I don't know what will happen. I know partially that I'm making progress, that can be seen in my accomplishments in school and life and in the changes in my symptomology, but part of me always feels like I'm getting worse and I worry that I'll never really be better. 


Mostly just needed to vent but if anyone has experience with getting passed psychosis-induced anger, I'd love some suggestions.

"Diagnosed as Bipolar NOS I am wondering how conceivable it is I might have schizoaffective disorder. I know I have manic episodes and this isn at disputable.

These are the symptoms I get outlined on the mind website. 

a lack of interest in things
feeling 

disconnected from your feelings

difficulty concentrating

wanting to avoid people (mainly new people or large groups)

disorganised thinking and speech (but only when I am manic)

I don at really class myself as depressed but I do feel like my personality has changed somewhat since I had my manicepisodes. When I am not manic I feel like lazy, unmotivated, no interest in anything, and I am a lot more introverted, and I can sometimes feel like somethings not quite right with me that comes out as self deprecating sometimes

"I've kept this to myself for a long time I have hallucinations. Not all the time, they just happen occasionally, less and less often, though when it happens I am absolutely petrified. They only happen when I'm either alone or the only one awake, though I have woken up partners in the past due to my hallucinations, they're unsupportive so I sit and usually cry and shake by myself. When they happen I stay up all night because I'm so scared they're going to get me, I try to keep my eyes on them so they can't get any closer.  These hallucinations only happen at night.

"You ever think you figured out too much? This happened first when I was in a mental hospital.  I was delusional and thought my brain had tapped into some secrets that the government (or new world order, whatever LOL...there could be a larger thing than the U.S. gov't, and I don't mean the UN) didn't want me to know.  I think I walked into that hospital not schizophrenic and walked out schizophrenic.  So here's what is maybe possible.  Serial killers used to be a big problem in the 70's/80's right?  So maybe they diagnosed me as a psychopath and since they had me in the mental hospital somehow made me delusional so I'd have to be on these sedating meds for the rest of my life. Not that I even wanted to kill anyone, but if they diagnosed me as a psychopath (also something I""m not) then they'd want to keep me medicated just to be safe.

Of course, getting to the main point of my post, maybe it's possible that serial killers don't exist.  Maybe these ""serial killers"" (and maybe also people like the guy who killed the president) were innocent and they just put these crimes on them to put them in prison or to execute them to shut them up.  Maybe they gave them some sorta drug to make them think they actually were serial killers so they'd ""confess"".  Who knows?

"Title Well guys its 1:30AM March 3rd and I decided to look into symptoms of schizophrenia and things of that nature around the Internet and found myself here reading the DSM-5 in the subreddit description. Was watching the Alex Jones Joe Rogan podcast earlier after smoking marijuana and Joe said something along the lines of how schizophrenia is real and people think others are after them and everything is some giant scheme simply put as against you. I started to think about how since August of 2018, I stopped my recreational usage of the most strong substances I ave come across which is LSD. Ive been using LSD on and off since December of 2016 but as I stated have stopped. 
There was a time in the summer of 2017(I believe?) where I was experiencing an episode of psychosis telling me that I was essentially inside of the Truman Show movie and everything was just fabricated and most importantly not real. Another time was my second ever use of LSD where I believe i was being hunted and soon-to-be confronted with an evil being that would punish me for doing LSD. Ever since then i have become closer to what I call the second voice in my head, it judges what I say, do, and even makes me question/be confused to my loyalty to friends, family and my significant other with constant dissociative scenarios in my head that play out whether i want them to or not. They are like tiny movies that I play while doing basic everyday actions like driving, showering, scrolling through my phone, hanging out with my significant other or friends. This comes back to my previous comment about the DSM-5, I read there that if symptoms like this (in the activation month) persist for 6 months(August of 2018-stoppage of LSD usage and the decline of my mental health; to March 3rd) and personally I can at sit here and act like that doesn at make everything make sense. 
Since August of 2018, I have been mentally run down, beat, exhausted, anxious and depressed pretty much every word in the book. Im not too sure if this subreddit is about serious posting like this but I just figured I ad get this off of my chest because it seems living my life isn at about my own free will anymore. I always have to have two sides of my head happy with a decision I make and evaluate what I say and do very closely as I am judged by myself. 
If anyone on this subreddit has had to take this route in their lives to cope with their mind because they are truly too scared to figure out what as actually happening then please shed some light on what could be happening to me with insight from themselves like personal stories or experiences.

The businesses & gas stations turned into just trees and it seemed like I was in the middle of a forest.

It was really quiet and serene then I got back in my car & just sat there trying to grasp what as actually going on. Then I start to feel like someone is patting me down & rustling through the things in my car. (No one or nothing was there) Eventually it gets silent again & I continue driving down this winding road. As The road seems to be coming to an end I see a kid pulled over standing outside his car next to a police officer. It then turns back into the previous road with gas stations & businesses and I keep driving home.

Didn't recommend getting testosterone since the body will stop producing testosterone on its own and I'd have to get the shots forever.

I don't expect anyone to fix my delusions and this doesn't happen so often that I'm willing to up my dosage yet, but can any of you think of things I can do to try to alleviate this fear without having to format and then download all my games again? This can happen every day for several days in a row when I'm symptomatic and the stress it creates causes me to be more likely to be symptomatic.

Thanks.

"(F21) Considering inpatient care for the first time, can I get some advice? Title sums it up. I ave been recently diagnosed as schizoaffective-bipolar, and it as been rough to say the least. My therapist really pushed for me to go to a facility the first time I met with him, but out of fear and delusions (hospitals and psych wards are a major trigger for me, I think they all kill me or sell my organs) I decided against it, hoping I could take care of myself well enough on my own. Well, it as turning out to be much harder then I thought, and my symptoms are getting worse every day despite being on so many meds. My therapist advised it again, saying I am in crisis, and he all attempt to get a referral for me. It as a big step for me to take, an undetermined amount of time with strangers, leaving my two year old to my family to take care of, and my job. Did anyone else have a hectic schedule and manage to make it work by going? Any advice, stories from your times there, really anything to read about it would immensely help from you guys in specific.

"What accommodations have you used in school to help make it more manageable? Hey everyone,

I am hoping to come up with some more ideas to help make high school and college more manageable.   
Here are some ideas I have already:

Homework:

Only being given the work that makes up the essential core of the class. That means exemption from all other work that serves a secondary purpose. 

Lectures:

Ability to record lectures and have a copy of notes for each lecture created by the instructor.

Ability to freely come and go during class.

Class Discussion:

Exemption from mandatory class discussion or permission to substitute with comments in a different format.

Group Projects:

Substitution of a group project with an individual project

Exams:

Distraction free environment

Open note tests

Rescheduling tests so that they are more evenly spaced/not on the same day

Extended testing time

"Do I Have An Untreated Mental Illness Ok, so I ave never come forward with this before so it all be all over the place. When I was 16, I was sent to a Christian rehab center, the place was terrible and basically ruined my life but that as for another thread. So my memory is kinda bad but I remember them thinking that I had DID or some shit and I was hallucinating. Like many things from that time it was never pursued and I was just given antidepressants and it fizzled out. But from then to now it as like I have voices in my head, not anything crazy but it sounds similar to my own sometimes. It as not like I ave ever seen anything that I can remember (but my memory is bad). I did talk to myself a lot I have since I was a child so I don at think that as a big deal. I know it sounds crazy but I am anonymous so my pride will let me admit this I guess but even though I am not Christian I guess I ave rationalized it as some spiritual thing. Like it all say don at do this and I listen to it. Or go here and I all do it. I dunno if that as normal. I mean it as not so bad that I am completely crazy but is there something wrong and should I pursue help Incase this spirals due to the depression and stress I ave been under?

"I am afraid they are lying. I want to start this off by saying that I am by no means trying to call them out, I am not going to use anything here to form my judgement, and I do understand how disrespectful it is to question someone on their mental health. 

If this isn at allowed here, please please please delete it and I apologize in advance. I don at want to offend anyone, I know that this a very serious thing and I am not trying to discredit anyone that has received this diagnosis. I am simply looking for help from the ones who know this topic the best. I am a clueless idiot. 

This just doesn at add up. I ave been dating this person for quite a few years now (have known them for 8+ years), and in the very beginning of the relationship, they told me that they had schizophrenia. I have always done my very best to support them and make them feel comfortable talking to me about the subject. 

But the problem is, I ave had suspicions from the start. 

The main thing that gives me doubt, is their job. You can at work this job with any sort of mental illness. There is no tolerance whatsoever. If you have so much as a mood swing, you are out. They background check everything as well. So how would they have this job if they have been diagnosed with schizophrenia and have been institutionalized for it as well? 

My other suspicions come from small things. Granted, all I know about schizophrenia is from what I ave read on the internet so I ave tried to take it all with a grain of salt, especially because not everyone is going to be the same. 

It as little things like going months without any mention of schizophrenia, no problems whatsoever, and then some minor thing happens and all of a sudden the world is ending. I just didn at feel like that made sense. It as only when they are doing something they don at really want to do. (Supposedly they are prescribed medication but they don at take it because of their job, yet they are perfectly fine going years without it.) 

The other thing is the body language queues.  They are not a good liar at all. I can almost always pick up the lie immediately. This is something we ave been working on in our relationship, and I have been lied to by them way more than any person should allow. Safe to say there was some trust issues to begin with and I feel like that may be fueling my doubt. It just seems like every time their schizophrenia is talked about, they are showing the exact same body language, speech patterns, and behavior as they do when they lie. 

The last thing that really gets me is the way it as all described. It sounds way less like schizophrenia and more like they may be trying to say that they are a psychopath. I ave taken note of everything said and there as very few things that line up with what I ave read about schizophrenia and more that line up with being the exact definition of a psychopath. I feel like at some point they were interested in psychopath behavior and then got the two completely mixed up and now they are just rolling with it. And another example, I was told by this person that they have no empathy. But it really seems like they do. They get angry. They cry. They get happy. All of the emotions are there. I tried to justify that by thinking that it may have been the ability to copy others emotions but they all seem way too genuine to me. 

I don at want to go too much more into detail, because it doesn at really help for what I am asking. I don at want to doubt them. I just feel like this is such an Unopen book in our relationship and it as driving me crazy. I get that schizophrenia has got to be scary and they may just not want to talk about it. I respect that 100%. But what do I do? Should I just let it go and trust them? How would I even bring up my concerns if I even did decide to talk to them about it? I just don at know what to do here. I don at know what to think. ",Schizophernia

"Mild hallucinations? Disclaimer: I don at have a schizophrenia diagnosis and I am in NO way looking for one here, I know that I can only get one from a professional.

Anyways, I ave been having what I perceive to be some sort of mild hallucinations these past few months.
These include things such as seeing doors open on their own very vividly out of the corner of my eye, hearing my Dads voice in video game music, seeing shadowy things in the corners of my eyes, seeing faces at night even when I am not sleepy, I once saw the lights turn on by themselves at night, and I ave seen creatures (not shadows) in the corner of my eye when walking past my dads bedroom.

The reason I went to posting here rather than going directly to a professional is because there aren at any trustworthy professionals where I am currently situated, and I won at be going to a place with professionals before the summer.

When the lights were out,
The Demon stirred,
It gave a shout,

The sleeper woke,
He looked around,
In his little bedroom,
Nothing made a sound,

Suddenly a creak,
From near the door,
A demonic laugh,
Shook the sleeper to his core,

A shadow emerged,
Illuminated by the moonlight,
It slowly crept forward,
The sleeper shook with fright,

A chuckle was heard,
The Demon toyed with his prey,
The sleeper began to panic,
""Our father.."" he began to say,

The prayer went unheard,
The Demon called his name,
""Don't die of fright, Adam""
""""Wouldn't THAT be a shame!""

The foot of Adam's bed,
Adam is beyond terrified,
He put's his hands to his head,

""This can't be real,
Demons don't exist...""
""Wrong"" laughed the Demon,
""And you won't be missed""

The Demon leapt on the bed,
Sliced Adam with its claw,
Adam screamed in pain,
Blood gushed from his jaw,

He closed his eyes and repeated,
""It's just my imagination...""
A product of psychosis,
His mental-health's damnednation,

The Demon soon disappeared,
His jaw pain went away,
He was alone in the dark,
And what was there to say?

When all is done and said,

"Adolescent-onset Schizophrenia? This question is just for curiosity's sake: has anyone here ever heard of adolescent-onset schizophrenia that only occurs during that developmental phase (around puberty)? From 12-14, I developed what seemed to me a kind of schizophrenia.  I developed an external voice, really a separate distinct entity/personality who constantly criticized me and ordered me to do things. I even gave her a name: Nervouz, fittingly enough. This voice constantly nagged and criticized me non-stop, from when I woke up to when I fell asleep. I would often argue with her, sometimes out loud and I would catch myself talking to her aloud and have to shut myself up. Sometimes I would have to work on focusing on what people in front of me were saying because she would be talking over them and it was very difficult for me to ignore her.

I never discussed this with family (and still haven't to this day). I felt completely crazy, and I was incredibly embarrassed to admit something like this to my parents. I told a couple of friends years later in college, but at the time I literally told no one because of how embarrassed I was. It got to the point where I was starting to contemplate suicide because I was just weighed down with the constant bombardment of nagging and criticism, and I felt like I'd never be rid of her. Then one day, very suddenly, I got rid of her. She disappeared and never came back. And that was that. I haven't had anything like external voices since. I deal with depression, which has been a chronic thing since that time, but no more voice(s). I used to be scared of such a thing returning, but it's been so long that I no longer possess that fear. 

I'm just curious, can there be periods of schizophrenia in a person's life? Particularly during puberty, like something going haywire because of hormones or something?

She says she hears voices all the time and that she sees a little girl everywhere she is at.

She says that I cannot under any circumstances joke about books because they mean too much to her. If I say something about the plot of a book she will go off the deep end and lose it. 

She doesn't know any social cues so she doesn't understand how to talk to people or interact with people. If we stop at a gas station and there is people there she says she can't go in because she's scared of people and she doesn't want people looking at her. When people walk by her she winces and curls up like they are going to hit her. She also has a phobia of leaving voice mails.

"Worried I am developing Schizophrenia?  

Hi everyone,

Recently I have been worrying about getting schizophrenia or wondering if I am developing Schizophrenia/. Recently, I am wondering if I have been smelling phantom smells. On Thursday, my friend turned on the oven to warm up garlic bread and I could smell it from my room. Then on Friday, I thought I smelled pizza in a cafe and turns out there was pizza down the hall. But after that, I began to smell constantly trying to see if the smell was normal. Sometimes the smell was normal and other times I thought I smelled something else.

Later on during the day, I read that smell hallucinations could be one of the first symptoms of Schizophrenia and I started getting into a panic. I began smelling every second and trying to pay attention to what I was smelling. I ended up going to the doctor that day and he did a quick neurological exam and it turned out fine, and he said I was fine. Later though, I went back to my house and there were a lot of dirty dishes and food around, and I started smelling stuff and I was wondering if I was hallucinating and developing Schizophrenia. I dont if these are phantom smells, none of the smells have been something bad like rotten fish, eggs, flesh or anything like that. Yesterday night I had a full blown panic attack at nihgt, I couldnt go to sleep because I was having racing thoughts that I was developing the mental illness.

I have had not any auditory hallucinations or delusions/paranoia. I am just wondering if I am having phantom smells or I am overthinking it too much. I had an ear infection but still have fluid in the ear and I am a steroid nasal spray to help clear the passageway of my nose to clear the fluid out. The doctor said that might be the reason and my sense of smell is improving. I can still smell things regulary its just the things in my environment that have me questioning and worrying I am developing Schizophrenia. I am 21 and about to graduate and I do not get such a mental illness that will prevent me from having a career.",Schizophernia
"I had/ have schizophrenia? First sorry for my English, is not my first language. When i was kid i remember like 3 times where i ear creepy music for no reason, the music last around 5 seconds and scares me too much, i was around other people and the only one scared about that, so i was the only who listen that music. And at my teens I had very few times days where think to do something terrible, I wont do that and i know that was a very bad idea but the idea of doing that stay more than i want. Now I am around 25 and the only one bad was a terrible insomnia for moths that starts with something of my ex girlfriend. Now I am OK but i fear the future. My mother have schizoprenia and bipolar, i don't know if this is important. Thanks.",Schizophernia
"an excerpt from my autobiography. I am woohoopoopoo on most social media. The finished product will be posted there some day, some way. Thank you for reading. a RED ON THE LINE excerpt  
 The Mask  
 By Lord byron the seventh

I remember putting on a mask and never taking it off.  Never.  Never dare.  
 I remember pretending I was always okay.  
 I guess that as how the class clown got to be so damn funny.  
 Hellarious.  
 I remember pain.  
 Lots.  
 The fear of never knowing when the next strike would hit.  All day, but knowing.  
 The acknowledgement of terror when getting ready to receive the tallied blows.  
 They were kept track, for Christ as sake!  The highest owed amount I can remember was 38.  
 I remember the blows not being proper enough and having to be restruck, according to my 3-year senior brother.  
 Each blow was often two or three hits because they didn at count.
 I remember I had to be silent when being hit on my skull or body, anywhere where the bruises wouldn at actually show.

They couldn at help, but show, however.  
 Is that why they are called shiners? funny!  LAUGH!  
 Whether I was changing my clothes at home or the school as gym, the bruises were everywhere and very apparent.

I remember not being able to do anything.  
 I remember having to hide or Josh as punishment would be accelerated tenfold on me.  
 Hence, the mask.  That mask.  ...My own best kept secret!  ...God knows, and never answered.

The mask didn at have to be always happy, but at least blank.

I remember climbing the stairs to get to class and being far behind the other students a ascent.  
  I remember the pained charlie horses on my thighs sitting in the  backseat the day prior.  There as a bruised vein that remains to this day  on my left thigh because of it.

I remember the bus stop.  
 Crushing the winter Michigan as puddles of ice with my feet to vent my bizzare, contained anger.  
 Or maybe it was fall?  And I would squish the crispy leaves?  
 At least I saw robins in the spring.  
 And, as the bus approached each day, I had to stand still and receive blows to my shins.  
 This lasted for over a year, this abuse, this type, this kind.  Not exclusive, either, lol.

My mother stopped the kicked shins after discovering them one night.  
 My brother got scolded, and I got punished worst at whatever convenience of Josh as time.  
 Our mother held a stethoscope to my right shin to ensure there was a pulse and potentially no blood clots.  
 The bruises on my shins looked gnarly by then.  
 They were old and yellow in some spots, and refreshed and blackened in others.  
 There as still scar tissue on my right shin to this day.  ...Want to feel?????

Have you?  Would you know?  Will you keep sweeping this under the rug???

I can let you feel my bruises, finally.  Now.  
 It was decades of lies, denial, and anyway that one could only describe as covering up.

I only refer to my brother as biological, not even that of blood-relation.  
 Fuck you, Josh.  
 And, fuck our parents.  They knew.  They were authoritative.  They were  deciding our future without any of our passions considered.  I think my  brother became a derivative monster of our monstrous parents  white-privilege greed.

I would always fear that I would become my brother some day.  
  The disgust I have to share my physical and personality traits with my  family, and especially my brother, brings upon irrational guilt and  disgust in myself.  
 I felt so ugly, so weird, and so alone for years locked in my bedroom.  
 I ad highlight the TV guide for reruns or movies to watch throughout the day to help distract the time.

I pissed into cups, and had nonparishable food in my closet.  
 I had to hold my shit in all day.  
 After my parents got wind, they would let me use their bedroom throughout the day because the masterbedroom came with a toilet.  
 They act like they are innocent in all of this too, by the way.  
 I would sit there, on the ledge of my bed or my parents a bed, and draw, draw, draw atop of a TV tray.

My brother used to beat our dog, Sparky, to get at me so I would unlock the door and protect the poor thing.  
 My brother videotaped his actions on me, our dog, and even smashed mailboxes in the country and Richmond, Michigan area.

 The judge saw the tape.  My brother didn at get a felony, then, because  he and my dad fixed the mailboxes all day, Sunday, before the mail could  be delivered on Monday.

My brother was known as NIGGER SLAYAR.  
 His Michigan vanity license plate knows of SLAYAR, which Josh has since replaced.  
 The school he teaches at today had a Christmas-themed photograph of my brother saying, You know what I am sleighing?
 My parents knew, my whole family knew.  The town knew.  
 The teachers and police and whoever else were bribed with my brother as bootlegging CD business.

Joshua is a teacher and male and female basketball coach at Romeo Middle School.  
 All of this is so true, but let as call it alleged.

 I wrote to J Dilla as mother, as well as DJ Premier and Weird Al  Yankovic about all of this abuse.  I know J Dilla as ma wrote to the  middle school.  Nothing has happened.  Yet?  Ha!

Where do I even continue?  
 I can at end this here.  
 I am finally free to talk.  
 I am finally free to be me.  
 Finally.  
 Took over 30 years.  
 I am 33 come this May 2019.

I exploded yesterday, and that as how this has come into fruition today.  
 My loving wife, Rena, encouraged me to finally write this out.  
 She thinks my story needs to be heard.  
 Well, consider this a fraction of my autobiography to come.  
 More will change.  
 When this gets polished and released, I may be older than 33.  
 So, expect changes, but the same old song.

I learned to love myself more than was shown or ever given.  
 I learned the man in the mirror is a naked mask.  A perception of me with potentially hidden thoughts.  
 I learned to accept my decline was happening, and accept my rise by still doing.

I turned enough cheeks on all of this.  
 So, ya all can kiss my hairy buttcheeks.  
 I ave bitched about it before, and will probably never cease to complain.

FUCK YOU IF I INCONVENIENCED YOUR DAY.  
 SPEAK UP.  
 FUCK YOU.  
 SPEAK UP, NOW, OR IT WILL GO ON FOR 30 YEARS.  
 FUCK YOU.  
OTHERS GOT IT WORSE.
 FUCK YOU.  
 C aMON, BRYAN, IT WAS ORDINARY, BROTHER STUFF WE DID.
 FUCK YOU.  
I SWEAR, I DIDN aT KNOW. 
 FUCK YOU.  
 DON aT WORRY, WE aLL GET YOU FIXED.
 HILARIOUS, I DIDN aT REALIZE I WAS THE PROBLEM.  
 NO, WAIT, GOT SOMETHING IN MAH POCKET.  
 IT aS MY FINGER:  
 FUCK YOU.
 Why as Joshie keep calling me Byron, ma and dad?  
 It as only bad when he calls me NIGGER, FAGGOT, RETARD, OR FATFUCK???

And, this doesn at end here.

I will die with middle fingers raised and crispy from rigormortis:  
 FUCK YOU.",Schizophernia
"Do you guys ever see constant color patches/sometimes see things in a higher contrast of light? I've been diagnosed with Bipolar 1/GAD, (previously was diagnosed as schizophrenia) and I haven't seen any of these symptoms discussed in Bipolar forums so I figured I'd just ask around different mental illness communities and see if anyone else experiences these things. 

There'll be constant subtle morphing color patches all over the place, as well as sometimes everything being at a very high contrast. It's quite annoying. 

I don't know if it has to do with anything, but I figured I'd just ask.",Schizophernia
"Keep Hope Alive Friends I've been meaning to make a post like this for a while now. The fist of it is that my life is going super great now. 

I was going to therapy for about a year before my diagnosis, and as things were coming to a head for my symptoms we finally realized what's was happening. My appointment with a psychiatrist wasnt for a couple of months so we did everything we could for a couple of weeks to get me on medication as my symptoms grew worse and worse. I honestly didnt think anything was wrong really, things weren't that unusual to me. Looking back o can definitely say I needed help and I'm glad I got it. 

So I started medication, 5mg of Zyprexa which quickly became 20mg. Academia had been really important to me over the past few years. I graduated high school when I was 15 and immediately started taking college level math courses, I wanted to be a math researcher. I was 18 and a semester away from getting my AA when I was diagnosed. I thought I could keep going as normal but I dropped all but one of my classes the following semester and ended up essentially taking a break from school for about a year. 

I thought my life was over. It took me a while to tell my girlfriend and she was very supportive when I did, but I always worried about getting too symptomatic around her and how that would affect our relationship. The meds I was on basically destroyed me. I gained 60lbs in just a couple of months and was sleeping 16-18 hours a day. Essentially spending no time with anyone and just going on my computer. I remember thinking, though I'm not religious, that this is what gods plan for me was. That I was struck down and wasnt going to be able to live the life of academia I had always strived for, that my girlfriend would leave me and I'd continue on this path of despair.

Well that's not the case today. It's been a year and a half since my diagnosis, I'll be turning 20 in may. I'm on much better medications. I'm actually engaged to my girlfriend, I guess fiance now. I'm back in school at the top of my class in a Mathematical Proofs class. I actually just got a 100 on my last exam. 

What I'm trying to say here is that schizophrenia is a sole crushing disease, that we all here live with every day of our lives. Its difficult to parse what's real and what we can trust and that's makes it difficult to hope for a better future for ourselves. I was there, I'm still kind of there but I want to say that that is not the only option for us. We are human, and capable and strong individuals, and if you can find even a glimpse within yourself of hope keep that spirit alive. 

I love this community and I love my fellow schizos. We are strong! Keep up the fight!",Schizophernia

"Question about going to a doctor Hello, recently i have been put on medical leave for planning my own death. I have been trying to go to a therapist for half a year now and every time i go it seems like they kick me out or i get the police called on me for what my thoughts are. In the past i have been diagnosed with mania, ptsd, behavioral disassociative disorder, but even though i say i am worried i have schizophrenia, no one seems to think so, despite me hearing voices, seeing hands, and hearing something completely different from what other people are saying, and even my memories, when i ask people did this happen they say no. 

So my question from all of this, should say i just have depression as im going to go to a new doctor since im mandated, i am constantly worried now that someone is going to put me in a psych ward for the rest of my life against my will. I have a career and i really need to keep it intact. I am also worried i just cant trust people here because they do not see that even though i hear thoughts of wanting to harm people, i have no intent on it. I dont get to pick my thoughts and if they knew me theyd know i havent harmed anyone. I dont really know what to do and would just please love some advice from anyone whos gone through this",Schizophernia

I have been suffering with voice in my head, hallucinations, extreme anxiety, sleep paralysis and paranoia. It all happened when I was in highschool, I didn't know I was sick until I graduated highschool and went to college. The symptoms progressed slowly, it went from voices in my head to paranoia and then full on anxiety. I tried to talk to my parents but they didn't seem to care or they only took me to the doctors if I was begging them to. I can't work properly anymore without having voices in my head, my parents don't even care about me anymore and they left me alone dealing with my illness.

"Potential early signs of Schizophrenia? [POTENTIAL TIGGER WARNING] I am sorry, I know there are a lot of these and that they are probably really annoying, but I wanted your input on this.

So for a few weeks now (I think), I ave had problems with my sense of time. A week could ave gone by without me noticing it.

I ave also had what i on some level know are delusions, but that I just can at quite get out of.
Delusions such as believing that there as a Virus in my PC, despite me having a great antivirus, me being spied on by I think the CIA, me being stupid, that my neighbors are spying on me, etc.

I dunno if these are delusions, but I can at get rid of them and I can at quite comprehend that they might not be real.

There have also been what I perceive to be hallucinations.
These perceived hallucinations include doors opening in the corner of my eye (incredibly vividly), hearing my Dads voice when he as at work (has happened twice, also very vivid), hearing my bird under my office chair (I thought I could ave accidentally crushed him, scarred the crap out of me), seeing shadow people during the day in the corners of my eyes, at night seeing demons.

These demons a are one I ave named Sheela (sorry if that as an actual name), who I can feel/see sitting behind my chair, peeking out at me and who has talked to me inside my head, telling me that everyone hates me. Another demon a is some sort of spider creature on the ceiling of my room, crawling around. And a third would be a kid without legs, on a pole, kinda like a scarecrow. These occur at night, but not when I am falling asleep, when I am working. I will post a drawing of these in a few days, which I will provide a link to in the comments.

I ave also had multiple occasions of not being able to move, and having very disorganized thoughts for several minutes at a time.

It should also be mentioned that sentences are becoming increasingly hard to put together, sometimes I just mumble. My dad yelled at me because of it.

I didn't do it. I went back and embarked on a little adventure, being evicted from my student housing and walking the streets, eventually ending up court committed to live in a group home.

"Visual snow (?) and hallucinations Ever since a kid I have had problems with white dots in the dark.

I did my best to look up what they might be called and the only thing I can find is ""Visual snow"" or ""Visual static""  

When in dark areas I see these white dots floating around me. My mind often turns them into things. People, objects, creatures and sometimes even words. I don't think they ever made sense, but they do pop up.

When I was a kid it got so bad I went to the hospital. Was told there was nothing wrong with me.

I had just gotten over my fear of the dark, and that happened.

Now I find myself often getting these hallucinations as an adult. Almost 24 now and find myself seeing them so bad I jump out of my bed to turn the lights on. I play and love horror games. I have never had nightmares or hallucinations based on these games. These dots are something else. I can never describe them other than being something I absolutely am terrified of.

I would list my medication, however I've had these since I was a kid and am not on anything I was on back then. I still see them, I always see them forming things that terrify me. But I'm just stronger now, I am able to push through it. Not always, but more often.

With time, I worked through it, and I'm cautious of them now, but not as afraid as i used to be. 

The very first time I had moved into an apartment after couch surfing for years, on a beautiful sunny day, I was sitting on my floor just behind the balcony, looking out over the creek while I ate breakfast. 

I saw a black unmarked helicopter - the worst kind - in the distance. I stared at it. It was coming in my direction. Talked myself down from mounting fear as it came toward me with alarming speed and silence. It got about three hundred feet from my apartment (puzzlingly, still silent!)  before I got the idea to duck and cover behind the wall lest I be shot at, but just as I abandoned my breakfast and touched the wall, the helicopter turned to the side and then I noticed it was a fucking balloon.

"Progress post I don't post my own threads often, but I thought I'd do so here. I've put off sharing this for a variety of reasons. One, part of me doesn't like that I desire validation and appreciation from others, even though in reality that's a basic human component. We validate and support each other. I learned at a young age that vulnerability wasn't safe and so I've never really felt comfortable embracing this from other people. 

On the other hand, I don't want to make people feel bad. Without dismissing my own difficulties, I recognize that my experiences are relatively mild and that I was very fortunate to have caught things early. I've managed to utilize some of my strengths to manage symptoms and continue with my goals, though I know this is an extremely difficult thing to do. I don't share this to brag, but more so because a lot of people who know about my diagnosis (schizoaffective) don't truly know how dark the path I was on truly was. 

At one point all I could do was smoke weed and take medicine. I'd coast in school and get good grades because I was smart enough to wing it, but I didn't retain anything and frankly I'd see homeless people near my university and recognize that as soon as I hit the real world I was on the fast track to that. I seriously couldn't envision my life going anywhere; it was objective fact that I was going down that path because literally everything about my life centered around weed and dysregulated emotions from psychosis. 

I've sought trauma and general therapy, and I'm in my last semester of college. I'll be graduating with an engineering degree, and assuming I don't royally fuck up I'll be graduating Cum Laude. I have a job lined up that pays well. I am a student manager at my current job. I have a relationship, though my paranoia makes that a very difficult albeit worthwhile endeavor for me. I don't do a good job of giving myself credit where it's due. I constantly think of what could go wrong to fuck it up. Life is chaos waiting around a corner and I was a wrong turn away from a very dark place. I almost killed myself a few times because I was terrified of what was happening in my head, and sometimes I still have those feelings. But lately I've found it a bit easier to step back and appreciate these accomplishments. 

Psychosis sucks. I don't wish it upon anyone. Those of us who struggle with it persevere through circumstances most couldn't fathom, though to be fair I think I'd struggle living in anyone else's shoes regardless of if they were psychotic or not. It put me against a wall and essentially told me adapt or get left behind. My perspective on life has become cynical to most (realistic to me), but at the same time for once I feel proud for what I've overcome. ",Schizophernia
"SSI approval odds for Schizoaffective Disorder? Has anyone with Schizophrenia or basically Schizoaffective disorder been approved for SSI or SSDI on their first try? I've been told that people with schizophrenia that apply for disability are usually denied on their first try. I've been diagnosed with Schizoaffective disorder (major depressive type) 7 years ago and I've been suffering for the last 7 years without a solid treatment plan because none of the medicines work that well. And because of that, I have like 20 W's on my college transcripts and poor work history that shows that I can't stay for any longer than 3-6 months. In addition, I have been hospitalized somewhat recently because I was paranoid during work that customers were going to stab and kill me, and I had no choice to burn bridges with that employer because I did a no call no show for many days because I was confined in a psychiatric ward with no access to a phone. I have a lot of documentations (psychiatrist and psychologist statements and hospitalization records) to provide to SSA that will make my case solid for submission but I'm not sure if their protocol is to just basically deny all cases like this until a judge hears this case.

"Making friends is impossible. At this point I'm more mental illness than man and because of that no one likes me and would rather hang out with the popular and talented and skilled people, all of which I am not, because I am garbage and no one likes garbage so naturally they wouldn't like me.

Like, why'd people hang out with me when there are much more wonderful people around like, why choose me when they can choose them?

So making friends is impossible because I talk and people don't like me and would rather listen and talk to someone else that is not me.

People tell me to stop being negative, so I stop being negative, then they tell me I am faking it, and to stop faking it, so when I stop faking it, they get angry that I'm being negative again and leave me behind.

So yeah, I'm friendless and don't have friends so yeah, that's kinda how it is because I don't have friends because it's impossible to make them because I am garbage and garbage shouldn't be touched obviously.

"A rant I could have trust issues from abuse but I want to know if it could be any broader, for my own closure and so I can help myself better when with someone. Through my childhood I couldn't trust my mother, teachers, friends cause they told the adults everything, and my reality- I've had such tramatic hallucinations that two separate types caused me to develop severe ptsd, and for a long time I felt like I world was a horrible, dishonest place so I pushed everyone away (making me very lonely.) I'm wondering what anxiety could be coming from what, but I know that I feel like a small child compared to everyone else, whom I see as big, bright, and probably better than me in every way, wanting nothing to do with me. I feel so scared of what other people think of me that I don't even focus on how they feel, so of course most people are going to be upset, and not understand when all I can do is cry and lie to ""protect myself"" in my head.

"Do you guys think I could have schizophrenia? I have yet to see a doctor about this, but for a while now I ave felt like something is wrong with my mind. Initially I thought it could be ADHD, since I had symptoms like concentration issues and felt like I constantly had to be doing something. There was more to it than this, but I felt like that could have been an explanation. Somewhat recently however, I began realizing certain things that I was doing weren at exactly normal. Things like being irrationally paranoid or afraid of numerous things, being completely inexpressive with emotion, having extremely disorganized thoughts, etc. It reminded me of someone awhile ago asking me if I was schizophrenic, which, at the time I had written off, but now I wanted to look into it. So I did, and now I think it as a very real possibility for me, especially since it also covered some of the symptoms that made me think it could have been ADHD, but I am still unsure. It was mainly the fact that the more I actually thought about the different common symptoms, the more examples I remembered where I acted that way. The main thing I have not experienced, however, is actual hallucinations. I know enough to know that not all cases of schizophrenia necessarily have hallucinations, but I am also only 16 now. I kind of just needed somewhere to ask about this to see what people thought. I haven at talked about every reason that I think I may have schizophrenia here, but I would be happy to answer questions if it would help you guys understand better. If necessary, I could leave a list of symptoms that I relate to in the comments or something, but for now I just wanted to ask about this.

"False memories or delusional? Should we be concerned that this is the start of psychosis? For the past month, my sister has been having false memories about things that occurred in her past. From her childhood to even a few years ago. She firmly believes that all of these things occurred, however my mother says that they did not. 

Many of the things just don at make sense: teachers calling her ugly, faculty at her college sending emails about her to other faculty members behind her back - these types of things just don at happen. She recently mentioned an incident where she was dropped off at a friends house and the parents did inappropriate things to her (My mother knows and respects those people and could not believe it to be true). She also mentions that people have come to our home and peered through the window, followed her and my mother while going on a shopping trip, etc.

She remembers these seemingly false memories almost every day, and we hear new ones all the time. She is very logical when she describes them, even though they are likely not true. They seem to be all she thinks about, sometimes she cries about them and can at sleep. All of these memories seem to be centered around a paranoia of people making fun of her, talking about her behind her back, and doing hurtful things to her.

We think she might be developing schizophrenia, but since this began so recently, we haven at taken her to a specialist yet. We are still trying to talk to her ourselves. Has anyone here experienced these types of thoughts? The thing is, she doesn at seem to have any other symptoms of schizophrenia.

"Should I apply for SSI/SSDI? Been dealing with schizophrenia for the past 2 years and recently (last month) had my diagnosis changed to schizoaffective disorder by my psychiatrist.

My father is a single father who raised me by himself my entire life. He works hard for his money and lately my psychiatrist visits and hospital visits have been more frequent then ever before and my medications only just seem to get more expensive with each new one I try. I feel like I am just financially draining my father and I can tell it is hard on him. 

I ave only ever had 2 jobs: a food service worker at one of the fast food places at my university and working in the financial aid office for the university. 

My first day on the job as a food service worker i locked the entrance doors and tried to defend myself from my boss because I thought he was trying to attack me (fired on the spot). 

The people at the financial aid office were more understanding and dealt with me missing 11/18 shifts I was assigned to and still let me keep my job up until yesterday which was my last day due to me having to drop out of university due to my poor attendance and failing grades in my second semester. 

I fly back home for good tomorrow, the 16th, and I really feel bad about everything especially costing my father lots and lots of his hard earned money.

"Asking for a favour I just wanna start off by saying that I HATE MYSELF so much right now for doing this. None of you could imagine, but I REALLY need to reach out to some of you, so here I am, slowly regretting it, but doing it anyway.

I'm only 18 years old, I'm a university student studying Mechatronic Engineering. I've suffered from depression. Or at least I think that I have. I've been so lonely for as long as I can remember. And I still get this feeling of emptiness from time to time.

But being the little boy that I am, I've always looked up to superheroes. Especially to how they went through the most horrible things, but instead of hurting others, or themselves, they chose to help people out. I figured that it does make things a bit easier. And it was true. Even the tiniest of gestures. Seeing somebody happy made ME happy.

Now I don't know what I'm doing here. I think this may even be a huge mistake. But at least I'll go down trying, right?

So I thought long and hard and came up with an idea.  I want to do what I can to make sure that NOBODY feels this way, because it's dark, and lonely out there and because nobody should go through any of it. So I went online and built a website. I called it Alleviate. Which is a word that means to make problems less severe. It's just a community. It came to mind that people may not be able to afford therapists. So I thought that one approach could be to have all of us help each other out under one platform. You can follow a certain topic ranging from ADHD, postpartum depression, anxiety, and many more. There is a full disclaimer that the site doesn't offer a cure, or any of that, It's just a place for ranting and helping each other feel even just a LITTLE better.

Here's a link to the website: [https://alleviate.mn.co](https://alleviate.mn.co/)

I promise, all I want to do is help and all I ask from you is for any of you to just check it out, and if you want to join, you can sign up. I want a place for us and ONLY us. And while there is this subreddit and many more, it still doesn't feel like ours. And if I see that this idea helps people and actually benefits them, I'll turn it into a real thing from scratch.

All I ask for you to do is check it out and if you feel like you could maybe benefit from it, please sign up. The number of members that I get there would be an indicator of whether this should be built or not. All I want to do is help. I'm not making any money from this whatsoever. Its ALL free and I'm not planning or going to allow any advertising or anything. It's just something that I wanted to do that was ""good"". I'm just an 18 year old kid in his first year of university. If you hate  on me after this, I understand.

"Need help with my mum who as diagnosed schizophrenic Hi everyone, 
My mum was diagnosed with schizophrenia when I was quite young (I am 23). She was put in the psych ward several times for months at a time and I didn at think I ad ever get to see her again. She was pretty heavily involved with drugs at the time as well. She as been on clozapine for roughly ten years now. She as always stayed on it despite the awful side effects, namely weight gain and sedation. She sleeps so much that she can at really hold a normal job. She hates taking it but knows it as necessary to stay sane. 
Anyway, she got sick with the flu a couple of months ago and abruptly stopped taking her meds without telling me or anyone else, which probably made her feel even worse. The only thing that tipped me off was that she was able to get up early and was super touchy and agitated. She lied to me about it until finally coming clean to me. That night she went back on it. But because she had been off it for more than two days, it completely knocked her out and she was unresponsive, only able to wake for a couple of seconds at a time. Her speech was really slurred too. I had to call the ambulance and she stayed overnight at the emergency department. After that she was supposed to be tapering up to 100mg in 25mg increments. I highly suspect she as been off them this entire time - she isn at acting herself at all. She as incredibly vague and just kind of aimlessly wanders around the house. She has trouble with conversation, often trailing off and not being able to easily think of words. It takes her a while to actually get a sentence out. She also stares at me all the time and it makes me feel really strange. The past half an hour she as been kind of muttering to herself about having to do things but just sits/stands there. When you say something to her, she just looks at you with a vacant expression as if she as not actually understanding what you are saying to her, and then sometimes asks you to repeat what you ave said. It as as if she as frozen in this kind of limbo or something. I ask her if she as taking her meds and she vehemently maintains she is, but I don at believe her. I don at know what to do. I witnessed her being dragged away from me by the mental health team (literally) when I was little and it as something that has stayed with me since. I love her so much and couldn at stand to lose her again. Not having my mum when I was young was terrible. 
I am so sorry this is rambling and all over the place, but I need some advice if anyone has any. Thanks so much.",Schizophernia

"Question...I don at know where else to ask. My uncle is DX with schizophrenia, he is currently a ward of the state because he attempted murder (related to the voices, I don at fault him in anyway because his mother died recently before that so he wasn at on his medication) anyways, he is currently in a group home and has been there a while, the incident happened about 12 years ago now. He has recently been dealing with incontinence and they did a lot of testing on him and nothing physically is wrong with him, he said that there is an outside force causing him to urinate on himself. This is where I am absolutely pissed and am very concerned. The group home owner? (Not sure what the position is called) has been PUNISHING him for urinating on himself! When my grandparents went to see him he was in a straight chair for it! He also loves to go to church and took away this privilege due to the urinating. I suggested a brief until he can get proper counseling but they refuse. We have no say in his care they aren at even supposed to tell us most of this stuff. He is not able to leave the group home and live with us as he would have to stand trial if he was ever fit enough to leave the group home. I am just not sure what there is to do. ",Schizophernia
"Hearing voices? Hi,

When I get really high (off weed) I think I hear voices. Like it's not like I heard them physically with my ears but in my head. It won't be someone talking to me, it might just be I heard someone off in the distance maybe or a bump out side. Sometimes it just feels like the voice in my head (me) is just really loud. I also sometimes get extreme paranoia when on other substances.

"Abuse (trigger warning) What is abuse? Is it physical pain? No, I have endured significant physical pain without trauma. Is it psychological pain? Perhaps, but what, exactly, is the psyche? Some people say my brain is my psyche. Others say it is an emergent property of my brain. Some people say the question is meaningless. Maybe they're all right, maybe they're all wrong.

If abuse is anything, it is the misuse of a superior position or capability to exploit or harm another. The parent who induces emotional trauma on their child for the purpose of causing them to suffer abuses them, even if they never make physical contact or even utter a word. The same goes for domestic partners, whether male or female. It applies to employers, politicians, administrators and anyone who occupies any social position of authority, however trivial. Under this definition, almost all the abuse in the world cannot be observed. Thus, we can conclude that there are no observable correlata to abuse.

From this, we can deduce that the most ambitious, intelligent and successful abusers will seek to gag their victims to prevent them from speaking out about the abuse they are being subjected to. After all, if the victim says nothing about an invisible abuse, then there is *literally* no way that anyone else can know that the victim is being abused.

Now, the idea that someone is being bullied naturally arouses feelings of anger within us. How dare this bully commit such horrendous and cowardly deeds?? But if we thoroughly examine the social conscience, we will find that our culture (that is, Western/American culture) exempts and has always exempted some forms of action from scrutiny for abuse. Four or five decades ago, parents were more or less exempt from investigation for abusing their children. While awareness around this issue has grown, it has not actually disappeared, it has just morphed. Psychiatric intervention is, in modern culture, an almost entirely exempt activity.

I don't have any solutions beyond saying that I refuse to join the inter-generational parade of abuse. I cannot fathom the ocean of causes-and-effects which has led to the present state of abuse and, for this reason, I cannot even judge those who abuse. All I can do is stand my ground. I will not join you in your abuse -- it doesn't matter how many of you there are, it doesn't matter how loud you scream, it doesn't matter how many legal powers you have, it doesn't matter whether the latest opinions of science agree or disagree with you. No matter what, I will not participate in your abuse, I will not rubber-stamp it, I will not join it, I will not approve of it, I will not turn a blind eye to it, I will not pretend that it doesn't exist, I will not stop talking about it.

"Paranoid about something... (Please reply ASAP)  

Hey. So, a few months ago I started being paranoid that I was abused by someone close. It doesn't make a lot of sense, but the more opinions I read the more peaceful I can feel, I guess. So, one day I was already feeling like some shit was about to happen. The next day was when it all started. It all started the moment I woke up, saw the face of the person I'm suspecting (the person was closing my window) and (I'm not sure) but I remember interpreting the person's face as a perverse expression. This was the moment it all started. I realized my glasses were in a different position from the one I had placed before I went to sleep. I suspected that I might have been abused while I was sleeping (I have a very heavy sleep, and when I ""wake up"" while I'm sleeping and somebody talks to me it's like it is my subconscious talking, and I can't remember a thing the next day). The night that I'm paranoid about I was alone in the house with the ""suspect"". After a few days the suspect realized that I was acting weird and started to try to talk to me to know what was wrong, but I didn't say a word. During this time, the suspect started to take some ""weird actions"" (most people would interpret this actions as normal but, since I'm ""paranoid"" about this person, I find it really weird) to try and restablish a normal mood. After I got paranoid, I started locking my door to sleep, but sometimes I'm so tired I sleep in the couch and I end up going to my room during the night, but I don't remember it the other day. I talked to my psychologist about it, and he said that it is propably the fear of not being in control of myself when I'm asleep that manifested this ""paranoia"". My family is very religious, and my uncle told me that he had a feeling that he should talk to me about it, and he told me that it was just a thought my mind took too serious (I didn't tell him what I was paranoid about, but he got very close to it although I didn't say anything AT ALL). I also talked to a friend of mine and he said that it didn't make any sense and that I was just overthinking it. My brother told the same and told me that the person I was suspecting would never do such a thing, because this person was always a correct and respected person. A few days ago I ended up sleeping in the couch (I was really tired) and when I woke up in my room the person I'm suspecting was there just looking at me. I questioned what the suspect was doing there and the suspect told me that he/she was just checking/looking at me (probably to make sure everything was OK). My brother told me that it is a normal behavior of this person to check on people if they are ok while they are sleeping and that he was 100% sure nothing EVER happened. The ""suspect"" never hinted any psychopathic behavior, but then I think that it is the kind of cover nobody would suspect. I want your opinions on this, and please, don't joke about it, it is a really messed up situation and I'm feeling really bad about it. Would I wake up if somebody took my clothes off while I was asleep? Would I wake up if somebody touched me while I was asleep? Please, give me your opinions on this.

found out how to time travel through music, he said he found out how math relates to music in ways that are profound 

said he started understanding math equations to the point where he was teaching the teacher information. How he came up with the equations on his own

"Meds not working anymore? Hello everybody 
My husband has schizoaffective disorder and he has been having bipolar and schizophrenic episodes since late december. He has been acting very de oriented and confused till today.
He has been taken haloperidol, lithium carbonate, benztropine (for shaking cuz the lithium) and propanolol since like 3-4 years ago and he's been doing pretty good and focused. But since november his psychiatrist prescribed him metformin to lose some weight. 
He stopped metformin on January when he started to get sick in case it was interacting with his other meds.
Then on middle January his mom had to call to put him in the hospital inpatient room. He stayed there for one week and he came back home slightly better. But after couple of weeks he started to get confused again. I always made sure he was taking his meds properly.
Then last week his mom put him in the inpatient again , he was there for 5 days then he came back and didn't improve at all.
This last time on the hospital they gave him an haloperidol injection that he has to get once a month, then benztropine pills twice a day, and 1 Haloperidol pill at bedtime. They didn't left clear if he has to take lithium, his last blood test in there shows lithium levels of over 1.5 , so on the toxic side. However on the blood test of his first time on the hospital his lithium level were very low of 0.2.
I'm really confused why his meds don't seem to be working when they were fine for 3 years.

"Hearing your own voice, kinda like the bad angel Hi.  I am a concerned mom trying to help my son. So this is new to me news, and apparently it as been happening for a year or so.  He is 21 years old diagnosed so far with extreme anxiety and panic disorder. 

He finally told me this morning said it as hard to explain but he hears a voice that he thinks is like an internal voice of himself that eggs him on and he has no self control. Like, he has been having compulsive spending problems where I took away his credit card. And where he compulsively buys gaming things that add up to $200.00 of stuff. 

He said the voice says to just to it when he is struggling with making a decision about buying or not buying something. 

It doesn at happen only when he is having anxiety. It doesn at happen all the time. 

The one that scared him was when he was thinking about how easy it is to die (this is a new anxiety for him) and he was thinking about how people just kill themselves (my BIL, his uncle completed suicide in September sadly we had no warning and were blindsided by it). And he thought to himslelf that he wouldn at kill himself and his internal voice shouted NO! as if to say he was wrong and he would kill himself.  He wrote a paper on the incidence of gun suicides (how my BIL completed) last semester after my BIL died and he said he is so sorry he wrote that because now that is going round and round in his head.  Suicide facts, etc. 

So I am asking you all, what is this? He does have his psych appointment tomorrow and I spoke with the nurse last night, but he informed me of the audio stuff this morning.  

As far as I am aware, he has no sexual abuse or trauma.  He has had psych issues since about age 9, but it as never been more than possible bipolar 2 (which was then ruled out but I realize this could be back in play now) and severe anxiety, add and panic disorder. 

In your experience, in your opinion, is this schizophrenia? He will get the proper help. We are lucky to have good insurance and resources, etc. I am just trying to prepare myself for what this is. I want to read up on it, etc. 

He has been doing well at university, is finishing 3rd year and has a 3.3 GPA. Stupid major lol, but at this point the goal is get a degree and go to grad school.

"Where as the line between me being supportive and pushy towards my partner who still has symptoms on medication? I hope this post is allowed. My partner was diagnosed with schizophrenia a few years ago, following an psychotic episode in which he had positive symptoms: he began hearing voices and experiencing delusions and paranoia. This episode happened before we met. He has been on Zyprexa since the episode and the paranoia and delusions have gone away completely, but he still has auditory hallucinations. He told me he used to hear 4 different voices, but since starting the Zyprexa it has reduced to only one voice, but she refers to herself in plural form. He says he hears this voice every day, usually when he as alone, especially in the shower. 

It worries me that he still has the auditory hallucinations. He has previously been on Risperidone but told me he had some adverse side effects, so he doesn at want to talk to his doctor about adding any other medication because he thinks he all have bad side effects again. He told me he had told his psychiatrist the voices are gone, even though they aren at. I haven at pushed it because I am trying to respect his decision, but part of me still has questions. Is it realistic to think adding another medication could help the hallucinations go away completely? Am I overstepping by worrying about it or trying to encourage him to be open with his psychiatrist? And looking to the future - I love him dearly and we are planning on getting married. What will his future look like? Is it only going to get worse from here?

I would never have known he had this dx if he hadn at told me, and when I started doing research online to see how I could support him the best, all the advice I found was extremely negative and basically leave him while you still can which is not at all helpful.

When I saw my GP this week, I check in with her monthly, we were talking about stuff &amp; she asked if I had ever been diagnosed as schizophrenic ... and to mention everything I told her at my next appointment at the hospital (next week). 

My question is;
Is there any one who has BPD & Schizophrenia?
or, previously diagnosed with BPD but it was changed to Schizophrenia?
or has BPD with Schizophrenic symptoms?

Thank you for any answers or insight. 
And to everyone who reads this, please try to take care of yourself ",Schizophernia
"Am I schizo? Iv'e noticed loss of cognitive abilities and disorganized thoughts since my sophmore year and I didn't know what it was so I orginally thought it was my brother smoking weed in the house, bad posture, and menningitis all of which are pretty much incredible because I got a neck x ray which came back normal, and I didn't have mennigitis and the weed thing doesn't make too much sense logically. But even now when I'm around weed it's very hard for me to think and when I hunch I get dizzy and very disoriented and cannot concentrate or think well. This leads me to believe i'm imagining these symptoms kinda like charles mcgill from better call saul, and I'm really scared.  It got really bad today even though I was feeling better, then it suddenly got very bad and I was contemplating sucidie but I didn't because I didn't have enough money to buy rope at home depot. I could hang myself with a belt but then my mom would find me, and I can't really think of any other ways other than jumping off a cell tower which I imagine to be traumitizing. Can false beliefs of syptoms just be pychosis, and even if this is just phychosis what had been causing my mental deficits in the first place? I had a four point until junior year and now im failing a bunch of my classes and I took like four aps bc I thought I would get better if I worked hard. Im really sad. Im sorry that my post was bad and the main idea of it was kinda jumbled, I just want someone who might be expericing something similar to give me some insight.",Schizophernia

"What is the name of this weird thing that keeping plaguing me? Hello everyone, I need help figuring out the name for the thing that has been plaguing me for over 10 years.    

started small when I was in 5th grade, seemed to skip 6th had a great year, then came full force in 7th grade causing me to go to hospitals and eventually dropping out, despite being a good and bright student, it was just too overwhelming for me to bear.   

Id never had a normal time at school since.

I thought when I would leave school Id leave the ""weird thing"" behind me. 

Enter: college 

On some mornings, Like mostly in a classroom setting, maybe its the fluorescent lightning, I start to get loud intrusive thoughts. Embarrassing thoughts. like soandso is so cute! and I don't even think that, it just pops up. It gets so loud I think everyone can hear it, which causes me to get anxious and start to sweat and want to pass out.    

This only seem to happen in the morning. Ive been told I have schizophrenia, or paranoia. I also believe I have BPD. but I just want to know the name of this weird thing that happens to me.    

It just makes me want to run away from everyone and hide.  It can happen at home, but it mostly happens in school settings.

"Am I developing Schizophrenia?  

Hi everyone,

Recently I am worried I may have triggered Schizophrenia after going to the counselor to talk about health anxiety, which included those fears. The counselor, who had a masters in psychology and worked in counseling many years - said I did not have Schizophrenia. Later that night, I was really tired, I had like 4 hrs of sleep the previous night and the night before and I was still thinking about Schizophrenia and all of a sudden I heard an intrusive thought that said something negative. However I never heard this thought the next day. And the following day (saw the counselor on Tuesday), I was able to complete a research study, parts of my assignments, watch an NBA Game and talk with my parents.

Today was a bit weird though. I woke up and my heart felt a little funny and suddenly I wondered ""what if something is eating my heart?"". I had this same intrusive thought a few days ago but it went away. I said to myself multiple times ""No, its not. if there was, would I be alive right now? its not a belief based in reality?"". Still the thought stuck in my mind and I kept repeating to myself that it was not true. I understand the feeling is probably anxiety, or gas and nothing is eating my heart as I would not be here typing up this post.

And today I do not know if I am smelling phantom smells. I woke up today and I thought one of the rooms smelt a bit like Disinfectant, I did notice that our beer pong table was wiped. A few minutes ago when studying, I thought I smelled a sandwich. I looked around and saw a few sandwich and food wrappers that were already eaten but it did smell closer to me and when I walked around I found the area it was coming from, except the person did not look they had a sandwich but I am not too sure. I worry cause I heard Phantom smells could be a first symptom, but I am taking Omnaris to clear my nasal passageways to get rid of fluid in my ears.

Part of me kind of realizes it is a bit improbable to think that I triggered Schizo right after visiting the counselor who said I did not have it, but I worry my lack of sleep or visiting the counselor could have triggered it. Im just worried. The counselor said I had health anxiety and I found the counseling session helpful.",Schizophernia

"medicine changes? my daughter was diagnosed a couple years ago. but, i just wondered how many medicine changes are normal? or how often? this just seems ridiculous and idk if its like this or not as the medications i take for health conditions have been the same for years and aside from adjustments at the beginning, havent changed.

how long did it take to find one that worked well? do they generally take care of all the hallucinations or just minimize them?

just a quick rundown... in the past two years shes been on:

Abilify, Saphris, Latuda, Zyprexa, Seroquel, Risperdal, Geodon, Haloperidol

and many others, starting at the minimum dose and maxing it out generally within 3 or 4 months. honestly dont know how she stays awake sometimes, for example she was at max dose of geodon and haloperidol at the same time, taking each 3x a day.

it just seems like weve done every combination of drugs and worked thru the list and started over again and again. shes also autistic and younger in age so, while shes stopped hiding that she has hallucinations, i cant help but wonder if theres maybe a misunderstanding in how well the medications will treat them. that maybe they dont make every hallucination or paranoid thought go away but rather easier to deal with but she has the idea that they should all go away and everything will be normal and thus reports the medications as not working because a thought still comes to mind.

or as shes young enough and has other illnesses that shes mistaking what a normal worry or fear is and attributing it to this.

i really only have those concerns because weve tried what seems like every combination of medications at every dose and multiple inpatient stays and done the gene testing which says what medications should be effective. (anyone have experience with that? are they normally accurate or way off?) but it seems like those are some of the least effective for her.

so has anyone else had a similar experience? ",Schizophernia

I just watched this video/interview with this dude who suffers from schizophrenia and he at one point says if the interviewer were a hallucination he wouldn't be able to tell it since they are always so real. 

I was wondering, if he were experiencing such a hallucination wouldn't it be possible to find out it's not real by simply trying to touch it? Would your hand just go through?

"Are these symptoms psychotic? Hi I have an appointment in a month or two to get tested. I've been in therapy for many years now but could never find the cause of my problems. However, I know up until this point I've always been careful about what I tell people because the idea of this scares the shit out of me - and at the same time doesn't. As a preface I have experienced childhood trauma but do not have any known schizophrenics in my family, though have multiple people with BPD.

Anyways some insight into my symptoms would really help me. I plan on working up a full list before my doctor's appointment but don't really know what's anxiety and what could be more (I certainly overthink). Thanks. Also most of this stuff happens when I'm stressed, if I feel good then I don't really experience this.

- a constant state of fog and unclear/jumbled thoughts
- sudden spikes of extreme anger for seemingly no reason - this is especially true if I take my ADHD medicine
- if I'm stressed I often lose track of time and just sit there daydreaming in a fantasy world for hours or days on end, I still function but am only partially there
- I have looping panic attacks (sometimes) where my entire mind dissolves within itself seemingly. I seemingly entirely lose my own identity and more or less forget who I am.
- I see sparks in light and my vision becomes very hazy for seemingly no reason, especially when in public, this is in conjunction with all my other senses including touch becoming very numb and sometimes oversensitive.
- when I'm out in public I think people are looking and talking about me. Sometimes it goes as far to where I randomly start fights with people (never been in a fight though but I do just get like insanely angry for seemingly no reason).
- I have a god awful memory and can barely remember anything. Amplified when I'm stressed.
- I have a lot of conversations with myself... Like constantly, I feel like I'm in control of the voices but the reality is the only real way for me to stop talking to myself is if I just ignore the thoughts. Which isn't always possible.
- I feel like everyday I have a new pair of glasses on. Like with rose tented glasses everything just sort of shifts - as in my identity, asperations, what I enjoy etc. Randomly shifts.
- my sleep is terrible (probably just the anxiety)
- I often get delusions of grandeur where I think I'm some special deity , though I know this is not the case I for some reason cannot reason with the belief that I am.

Anyways, the list goes on and I certainly have some weird experiences in the past that may actually have been delusions. Though I haven't had any psychotic breaks or anything. would love some feedback on this as I seriously don't know what to think, hopefully the doc will be able to help me more...

I am a trainee clinical psychologist passionate about learning more about peoples voice hearing experiences. I am completing research exploring predictive factors of voice hearing distress and loneliness. It is hoped that the findings from this research will have implications for clinical practice.

I have put a brief description of the research here: 

Hearing voices is a relatively common and normal experience. We are interested in learning more about how people feel about their voices and the beliefs they hold about them. The study will also ask about  childhood adverse experiences, mindfulness of voices and emotion regulation.  It is important you are aware that for some people answering questions about their early childhood may be distressing ( support numbers are provided at the start and end of the research survey).

"I had a strange dream, my dead mother diagnosed me with schizophrenia This dream i had, it was very strange. In my dream I was trying to sleep on a park bench in an old town i used to live in, next thing i know im running. I get to my old house but it looks very different and weird but of course you i never realise this when im dreaming. My mum was there and hung out like she never left and she expressed some concern she had. And told me i had a type of schizoid/phrenic mental illness, she had a paper with three different mental illnesses on them, with two of the words crossed out meaning she was worried i had some sort of disorder and was trying to diagnose me. They seemed calm but worried at the same time by her facial expressions. And she also said that i have an inability to realise i have these symptoms , therefore unknowing to the fact that i have mental illness.

there is also reoccurring themes in my dreams that im always running. Whether it be running home, to my friends house, or just running aimlessly to nowhere. Ill be running for ages without stopping.

"How to get my psych to take me seriously Hello, all. I'm a lurker and finally got the courage to post. I'm not diagnosed with SZ, nor am I trying to self-diagnose, but I have a strong family history of psychotic disorders and feel my my symptoms more closely align with the SZ spectrum than anxiety so I thought you all might be able to give me advice with my psych.

I'm currently diagnosed with PTSD due to childhood events and other things. The flashbacks and major symptoms have been managed fairly well by medication (20mg escitalopram once daily), but other symptoms have shown up in the last few months and even my husband has noticed something isn't right. My sleep schedule has been funky, personal hygiene has been severely lacking, no motivation, hard to care about anything. And in the last month I've heard mumbling occasionally when there's no one there and (most worryingly) I've had visual... Blips, as I think of them. Walls look shimmery, spiders where there are none, a faint image of Our Lady of Guadalupe on my wall (and I'm not religious), and a shadowy figure occasionally lurking out of the corner of my eye. These blips happen at random throughout the day, not just on waking/sleeping, and not just when I'm anxious.

I've mentioned all this to my psychiatrist, even broke down crying in his office because of the distress this is giving me, and he seemed sympathetic but attributes it all to anxiety? He added bupropion 75mg once a day, and said I should start feeling better in a week or two, but so far the symptoms are still there and feel like they're getting worse. I sent him a message telling him how I've been since our appointment, but he hasn't reacted yet. All my friends are kinda worried and even my boss has noticed something is up. I just want some advice but I don't know what I want. Anything really, to let me know if this is normal anxiety symptoms or needing more psychiatric help before it gets worse.",Schizophernia
"Can you help me understand my uncle better? I am prefacing this with a warning. Murder, strong language, and suicide will be mentioned in this post. Please do not read any further if you are uncomfortable with those subjects. 
I ad also like to say that my uncle was never formally diagnosed, and my grandparents didn at treat mental health very seriously.  Please let me know if this isn at the right place to talk about this.

In 2017 my grandpa had missed an appointment with a customer, leading one of his employees to contact us. She hasn at heard from him either, and it wasn at like him to not show to scheduled meetings. We sent a police offices over to there house for a wellness check, but after an hour we couldn at wait any longer and started to drive to their house. Halfway through the drive, the police officer notified us that they found three deceased persons in the home. 
Going back a few weeks my uncle had been beginning to act off. He was a heavy weed user, so the thought was that his mood was explained by that. He was depressed, had been for quite some time, couldn at finish school with only one class left, and stayed locked in his room most of the day. 
When my parents and grandparents, along with my uncle and a few of his friends took a trip down to Las Vegas two weeks before these issues really began to rise rapidly. His friends informed us that while they were walking around Vegas with my uncle, he would say he overheard people on the street threatening them, and calling them pussies, faggots, even though his friends were standing right next to him, and didn at hear any of that. They also admitted to other drug use while partying down in Las Vegas, specifically mentioning ecstasy. He continued to hear these types of conversations around him, his friends having to calm him down after each instance. 
Things started to get out of hand even faster, and my grandma decides to finally reach out to my dad to ask for advice. 
My uncle had supposedly heard a conversation in the middle of the night had by my grandparents, to which he immediately woke them up as asked about. What he had heard was that my grandmas brother was giving them a million dollars, half of it being specifically for him, and when he woke them up after hearing this conversation, he demanded his half. My grandparents were confused to what he was talking about, and told him it didn at happen and to go back to bed. He insisted he heard it, and was getting angry and accusing them of stealing the money from him. He continued to hear these types of phone conversations between his parents and his uncle, confronting them about it each time, sometimes seeing them talk about it in front of him, and seeing other things that didn at exist.
The day before it happened, my dad met with my grandpa to get some drinks and to talk about what was happening, because my uncle had been getting angrier by the day. He got a spam letter in the mail, which he was offered to invest in some big opportunity, he claimed that this was because the company knew about the money that was supposed to come to him, and he was going to invest it into the company that sent him the letter.  My dad advised my grandpa to take away the gun my uncle had in his possession, but my grandpa didn at think it was that serious of an issue. 

He killed my grandparents the next night, and then himself. 

What I am hoping to take away from this post is... just to get a little closer to my uncle. though, like I said he was never officially diagnosed, it as just a speculation held by me and my family given everything that lead up to the end. As his niece, I can at help but feel like I failed him by not being able to see these signs, we were very close as children being just 4 years apart, I wish I could have done more to help.

"Disability and Marijuana in WA state Diagnosed somewhat recently with sz and with PTSD and clinical depression a long time ago. Had sz symptoms for around 4 years but was too scared/ didn't accept it or seek help until recently. My main question is how does the process for applying for disability work? My doc thinks returning to work is unlikely and i haven't had luck with antipsychotics + antidepressants. They either don't do much of anything or make things worse. In the past before diagnosis limited marijuana use helped a great deal except of course that it could become addictive and does make me hallucinate a bit more, though they're not violent or paranoid kind of hallucinations, depending on the thc strain. I'm scared to bring this up with doc though because not sure how it would effect disability if I would rather use thc extract over these other options. Some meds have helped some symptoms but always trade off for other bad side effects that still keep me from functioning fully. I haven't had thc in many months or even alcohol but this anxiety is getting worse and suicidal thoughts/ voice has come back with antipsychotic. Im just wondering if anyone knows more about this kind of situation im in. It feels ""wrong"" to me that I felt better consistently before I stopped thc for antidepressants and antipsychotics. Thc doesn't stop voices or hallucinations but made them ""good"" if that makes sense. Ive been reluctant to go for disability benefits but I have no other options any more. I just want to know if I also have to stay on meds that aren't helping or stay off meds entirely until i am covered. worst case ill probably drop the meds and drink alcohol to get sleep and dull voices until disability is secured. Any input, even dissimilar experiences are welcome.

The hospital I was at was pretty nice. I had my own room and bathroom, but I had to keep the door open all of the time, unless I was changing. They checked on me every 15 minutes. They also let us sneak dogs in, so there were dogs all the time! My dog even got to come for a visit! It was such a nice treat. But not being able to go outside was making me go crazier. I ended up staying for two weeks. They told me to just take it day by day, which made it go faster for sure. I spent a lot of time socializing.

After that, I went to a house full of suicidal people and only had to be checked on every HOUR. I stayed there two weeks before being transferred to one of the few residential treatment facilities available. Some were apartments for long-term folks, and some were co-ed. I ended up at a women's only house that focused on trauma. 

I'm in a day program now. I go into a center 3 days a week to learn about coping skills. The routine and the coping skills are supposed to help me stay out of the hospital. I have a good psychiatrist and psychologist, plus the therapists at day program. 

I don't have rich family members supporting me, though, like the other people in the program. At some point soon I'm going to have to switch day program out for an actual job. Hopefully I do that before I lose my apartment. :D

"What to do with the rest of my life? [Advice needed] Greetings folks.  

I'm in a bit of a predicament right now.  I have been diagnosed schizoaffective/bipolar with PTSD.  
I have the means to support myself for the rest of my life.  I am currently in school but loosing my drive to finish.  I began at a state university this spring semester and have been put off by the work load.  The work load basically tripled from community college to the state level.  

Question is - what the hell do I do with the rest of my life?  I have a plan in place, but it's not really academia based.  I have filled my days with the gym, and church activities four days a week (for about two hours per event) just to get me out of the house.  I have many unread books that I have collected over the years as I either liked the subject or thought it was something I could learn a lot from.  I have been tossing up the idea of getting a part time job but fear that will only interfere with my mental health as last time I was employed I experienced a stress induced psychotic episode and was hospitalized for a week, this event took place before there was a diagnosis or medication in play.  After the medication and receiving benefits I gained about 70lbs and I am planning scheduled exercise and diet restrictions to loose the weight I put on.  The problem is I don't have the motivation to keep any type of schedule.  

I'd love to hear any input about this, as I am perfectly happy to resign my life to that of a hermit.  

Peace and love folks, 

Toph.",Schizophernia

I am not sure how to deal with this situation and I am hoping I can get some advice. 
My boyfriend was diagnosed recently, within the last 6 months. He has been taking his medication on and off. The longest he took it consecutively was 2 weeks.
He just told me he hasn at taken his meds in 3 days and he refuses to take them anymore.

"Don't mix I take a certain medication for my depression that shouldn't be mixed with drugs, Unfortunately I was taking weed almost everyday before I got the medication. Only those who have taken drugs understand how hard it is to stop. I remember the doctor telling me that mixing my medication and weed can cause Psychosis. I tried stopping but I lack self control and continued taking my daily hits along with the meds. At first I was fine, but slowly I started to lose touch with reality. It almost feels like I'm looking at my life through a television screen. I lack any sort of empathy, emotion or motivation to do anything. On the plus side I no longer feel depressed, but I almost miss that feeling because at least then I actually felt something. I feel detached from my own body. 

About a month ago I had my first hallucination. I was walking down the road to my local 7/11 to get a snack at around 10pm. That's when I noticed a figure standing at the very end of the road. I find it hard to describe him so bear with me. He was unnaturally tall and completely black despite the street light shinning on him. He looked like a shadow and he just stood there. I couldn't tell if he was staring at me or had his back turned to me because of how far away he was. I stared at him for an eternity. He would randomly teleport every couple of minutes to a different spot on the road witch was sometimes closer and sometimes further away from me. His posture never changed. Since I don't feel emotions anymore I didn't feel scared and decided to walk down the road. The closer I got the lighter the shadow grew till he vanished. Since then I randomly see him in the corner of my eye or standing behind people for split seconds. Emphasise on the split seconds its just a flash then he's gone. 

Basically I think my weed mixing has given me psychosis but I haven't officially been diagnosed and I'm not entirely sure what happening to me and I have no one else to talk to.

"Just an observation I thought this might be an interesting bit of info regarding potential treatment of negative symptoms. I have pervasive problems with thought formation, the primary manifestations of which are: no thoughts, having only fragments of thoughts (thought blocking), word retrieval problems (anomic aphasia), feeling like it's really difficult to think, zoning out when thinking or talking, brief, vague thoughts and phrases (alogia).

What I noticed is that whenever I quit antipsychotics after taking them for at least a couple of weeks, my thought/speech problems COMPLETELY resolve and I am able to hold long-hour conversations about whatever (even philosophy). It goes on like that for about a week, then it goes to shit again.

My rudimentary knowledge on biochemistry allows me to theorize that dopamine levels somehow change during that period, since antipsychotics interfere with dopamine, but that's all I can say.

"I don't think I'll ever be able to drive. To preface, I lurk in this sub frequently. I don't know if I necessarily belong here. I apologize if I don't.  They haven't actually pinned down an official diagnosis or anything. I mostly experience auditory and visual hallucinations, paranoia, delusions. I don't know if there is a word for tripping over, mixing up, and not being able to think of words. About 60% of the time I can handle it. Not all the symptoms are constant.  But onto the point.

 I'm 24. I have never had a driver's license or even a permit. I've probably driven/attempted to drive about 10 times. The couple times I managed to do so with out panicking were at night with no one else on the road. I've been in 6 car accidents ranging from minor to one that was pretty bad. I wasn't driving in any of them, of course. I have days where I can hardly keep my eyes open while riding in the car. I'm constantly afraid and jumpy. 


The fear of crashing due to another driver, my hallucinations, just anything that could happen is too much. 


I know I need to learn to drive. I'm so sick of hearing that everyone is nervous at first. I'm not nervous. I am terrfied. I won't get used to it. It feels like it's only getting worse.

"Really think I'm schizophrenic or have some sort of thought disorder. Been diagnosed with ocd and anxiety since I was 10 (im 22 now). The last year I started having more intense symptoms where I thought I was going crazy... I started doing research on schizophrenia and it's sparked a new obsession of mine. Soon enough after that I started to hear different voices in my head and had got dissociation. Last summer around July I got prescribed geodon, I took it for a little while and got seizures on it. Taken off immediately. I then went through weeks of laying on my couch convinced I was psychotic. The world had never seemed this weird to me before. I'm talking about what I thought were delusions which started happening more and more. Then I told my psychiatrist and was put on Lexapro. At first it was making me feel super manic and was getting me feeling weird. Eventually got prescribed klonopin, taking it would knock me out and actually calm me down a bit. I took that for a couple months and then started to enjoy life again having less and less problems... 

Until: a woman I worked with had a mental breakdown I started getting really worried again after that and developed another fear of schizophrenia.

It felt like I was losing my mind again. Soon it moved into Panic attacks, derealization, now I'm having thinking problems and even dissociation at times. I struggle to think coherently and constantly have flight of ideas, (where my thoughts just race from random memory to another after seeing an external stimuli). My behavior has been incredibly disorganized lately, I've been unable to really remember basic things throughout the day that I need and often jump from task to task without being able to complete them. I was smoking alot of cbd weed the last couple weeks since I got freaked out from the woman who had a breakdown. It helped me relax but when it wore off I'd start feeling nervous again. I don't know if maybe it messes with the ssri I'm taking? I've been having a hard time reading and understanding words. I've also read that a big thing in psychosis is seeing faces in objects. If I stare at the ground my mind scans and does that too where I see faces sometimes in like patterns, apparently my mom has this too and she's an artist, she told me it's a trait from that. My mood has been all over the place ranging from extreme happiness and confidence and other times feeling worthless. I haven't ever seen a real hallucination or heard voices externally though. So I know that's the biggest thing to schizophrenia or psychosis and is the most common symptom. That's why I have no idea what the hell is going on. My psychiatrist has told me he doesn't think I'm schizophrenic and my therapist who had worked at a psychiatric hospital for 15 years also said ""there's no way you're schizophrenic"". The thing is I just don't know how to explain these symptoms. Something just isn't right in my head. The disorganized thinking and quasi mania is really what's not making sense to me. I've been feeling fucking awful and I really want my mind to feel better but I haven't reacted well to antipsychotics. I did take abilify at one point and it did help for about 3 weeks but the side effects were awful. It did, however clear my mind entirely and I could think clearly. Do they prescribe ability for add too? Or ocd?? 

I have a history of taking stimulants quite alot too. I was said to have had add, but I was wondering if the hard time focusing just came from psychotic thinking.

Was on 40mg of Vyvanse for 3 years daily, then 2.5mg of dexedrine daily for 2 years. Came off of it in 2017. Haven't taken those meds ever since. 

I'm currently 20mg of Lexapro at the moment. It helped for a little bit. I was bumped up from 15 to 20mg. Which caused me to get more side effects and bring out more of the starting effects I had. ",Schizophernia

"Arrested and undiagnosed My friend has been experiencing what we believe but has not been diagnosed as schizophrenia with paranoia. It has been a tough six or so months and things have escalated. His delusions/beliefs have him convinced he is being targeted by a growing network of 200+ people using electronic torture and EMFs to frame him for all manner of things. He now believes my husband is being blackmailed into helping this network torture and frame him. His girlfriend is one of our best friends and she is blown apart by all of this. I have read the sticky post and have forwarded her the information, but I digress.

I am posting because last night, our friend was arrested for criminal trespass. It as the second time in the last few months that he has been taken in for this charge and it all revolves around the place he used to rent - the place he believes this all started. 

My question and reason for posting is ultimately trying to gain an understanding of what an arrest could mean for him. His last arrest, his behavior was more muted. Since then he has progressed significantly into his beliefs and has taken to a lot of behaviors that, frankly, scare us a little bit. 

He has not been diagnosed. He refuses to go to the doctor and we are not able to get through to him. I do not understand if the county can force him into observation or medical treatment. I do not know if this would be good or bad. Mostly I am just trying to prep for what he needs when he is released. I realize that without an official diagnosis (and even with one), we may be of absolutely no use at all.

"33f with my 32f that differs from schizophrenia.. how can I better manage her moods, or not take the things she says to heart.. etc We matched on tinder back and forth over a 3 year span. She never thought I ad be into her.

Cue this August and we see each other, spent the evening together, had sex at my place and that was that.

We became official late October and that as when I learned she has herpes. Even when I said it as illegal to knowingly have sex with someone without telling them your status and she said she all take the misdemeanor mind you,  this is coming from an attorney or whatever it as called when you went to law school but didn at even try to take the bar.

I all save you the ups and downs.. but one day after a disagreement she showed me her phone... it said schizophrenia and listed a myriad of symptoms. Honestly, she fits in to almost all of those categories. She has even admitted she has persecutory delusions.

I have surveillance cameras installed (stealing my amazon packages) and my home is VERY clean and organized. I also know Uh lot of people so that too convinced  her that I am an an undercover cop. She told me if she hadn at met my family for Thanksgiving she would have been 100% sure I was. She even asked me to do some fire consulting.. only to find out months later, it was just really to see if I am actually a firefighter or an undercover cop. 

Other things she added to her undercover cop narrative are ancestry kit  she asked for (she got it, and that means I am definitely an undercover cop because I am tricking her into giving the gov her dna. Her brother is schizophrenic and according to her, the way her mom handles her brother is by ignoring him.

I have much more to include, but basically I have been in the dark while she as pissed of at me for no reason (dna tests, private flying lessons, a Tile so she can track her belongings) and I am hurting wondering what I did to merit this aloof and angry demeanor.

I started seeing a new therapist in nov. I go once a week. Even my partner came to do a couples session with me.

She doesn at want medication. She doesn at have health insurance and frankly I love this woman. She as my best friend, my lover, my favorite person.

There is no doubt I will marry her.

But reddit, how can I approach this? She as said she need mood stabilizers but won at see a dr. She as been to therapy 3 times.

I am losing the one I love because of her mental illness (I believe it as schizophraffective because she has INSANE mood changes..

When she as off her cycle/episodes, which is every 4 days) she is loving, funny, my best friend, and just the coolest person I ave ever met. She gorgeous and I hate that she doesn at see what I see. She yells that I should just leave; she doesn at know why I want to be with her...

She has this thoughts that I know will eventually kill her if she doesn at get help.

I said if you were born needing insulin, you ad take it everyday for the rest of your life because that as what as needed for you person to live.

She goes back and forth with getting on meds.

"Schizophrenic brother and tips to cope If this is the wrong place to post this please delete it. Last weekend my brother 19M paranoid schizophrenia diagnosis, went into some kind of psychosis, not sure. He has been struggling with symptoms progressively getting worse since he and his gf broke up about 2 years ago. She had a lot of the same mental problems too. Somehow she got him onto this group called TI- targeted individual. Not sure if anyone is familiar with that. He thinks that everyone is a clone, or working with the government against him to kill/hurt him. He lashes out at my parents and I frequently because he doesn't think we are real. He also thinks he has implants in his head and a camera in his eye. Any people walking around or cars driving by would set him off and put him in a panic. He finally got on some medication but was not taking it frequently enough to have any effect. 

He left the house about 9pm, no shoes on, in shorts and a t-shirt 40F weather. He ran barefoot for a few miles, somehow got into a store, cut himself up, and then got into a vehicle and crashed it. He said that the voices in his head told him he was in imminent danger and about to be killed. I guess he cut himself on purpose and his ears/face are hurt. I am at a loss and have no clue how to even begin to process what happened. I'm so upset for him and keep crying. 

I guess my question is, what is the best way I can support him? He is in involuntary mental health ward at the hospital and will probably face legal consequences. I know to watch what I say, be kind, and not engage when he gets angry. I can't imagine what he is going through. I hope now that he will have time to cool down and get the professional help he needs. Until now he has kind of been off the rails and my parents had no clue how bad it was or what to do.

"Help me to understand I (29f) have been with bf (38m) for about a year now, it's been a lot of stress. I often find myself in abusive relationships, I don't know why. It's gotten a little bit better since the beginning, but still feels like a helpless/hopeless situation. 
Bf was diagnosed with paranoia schizophrenia back when he was 21, so about 17 years ago. He doesn't talk about it because he believes there's nothing wrong with him. He hears Jesus and God, or ""feels them"" I'm not entirely sure, and satan as well. He was in mental hospital off and on between 30-37. He's outpatient now and hasn't been taking his pills for two years or so he says. He refuses to take them and if I mentioned taking them he'd go into a rage. 
I feel helpless. I work and rent apartment, he lives at his parents, and stays at my place which is an hour away for long periods of time. Refuses to work because its working for Satan, so gets his monthly cheques, but it's not a lot. I'm now struggeling to make ends meet.
Back story: he was once marrried, had a son, and had his own business. Lost it all. He isn't allowed to see son, and is divorced.

This past weekend: we went on a long walk around the city. We usually do, but this time as we were stopped at the lights he pointed across the street to a random photographer dude and claimed he was working for satan and we had to wait. We then crossed and that photographer was walking up he same street we were. Bf kept saying he was taking photos of him, etc- I tried to reassure him that he wasn't and to try to calm down... but he kept arguing and stating he knows he's satan. Long story short, I was getting really anxious and walking fast, bf was trailing behind and ended up confronting the photographer dude and swearing at him etc. Later in the day he apologized, but its just so stressful, nothing I do even helps.

He firmly believes all these things. He talks to himself all the time and completely believes god and Jesus are talking to him. Wonder if anyone here has dealt with this, can I help at all? He is completely against getting better, thinks everyone is working for satan.

"Sleeping problems and hallucinations on medication Hi guys,


I'm 23, male and I've been diagnosed with Schizophrenia about 5 months ago. I have a history (starting 2014) of psychotic episodes.
Currently I'm taking 600 mg Seroquel XR.
I work as a software developer in a small start up.
I'm working 20-30% at the moment but would like to work 100% (full time). However I'm unable to do so. It's because I can't concentrate for more than 4 hours and my sleep is irregular too. (Sometimes I sleep for 8 hours and sometimes for over 15 hours. X( )
I'm wondering if this is normal when having schizophrenia or not. My therapist said I shouldn't experience hallucinations on medication. What I recently discovered is when I'm not working (vacation) I practically have no hallucinations. My sleep is still irregular though. 

I'm wondering if some of you can relate and maybe guide me to the next steps I should take. (New job, another medication etc.
In the end I want to live my life as normal as possible.",Schizophernia

"Saying goodbye to alcohol due to triggering of symptoms. Anyone else? After going on a bender for a few weeks of too much drinking everyday I started getting schizophrenic symptoms, on top of the typical anxiety caused by the hangovers. Delusions, paranoia, social anxiety and self-hatred. 

I'm two weeks sober now. The only drugs I used to do were alcohol, weed, tobacco, and caffeine. Well, I quit tobacco for health reasons and weed because it makes me psychotic. I never thought alcohol could trigger psychotic symptoms in me, but I guess I was wrong. I've been trying to quit alcohol for quite some time but I think this time around it's gonna be different because now that it's triggering my symptoms I really don't want anything to do with it. Could be a blessing in disguise because I definitely hate life when I'm symptomatic and do everything I can to avoid triggers.

I asked my psychiatrist to give me some medication to help me quit and now I'm on gabapentin. It really helps with the cravings.",Schizophernia

"Afraid of developing mental disorders Hi guys 

I don't want to go into too much details because of that fact, there is too much detail haha but basically I am a 20 year old male who has experimented with drugs (weed, psychedelics, alcohol) but have been totally clean of every drug for about 3 months now. I am pretty afraid and paranoid that I might develop/be developing psychosis or schizophrenia. 
I am pretty self conscious and aware at times of my own thoughts because I want to make sure if there is any changes or signs/symptoms I catch it. Obviously since I scared myself with the what if thought one day, this behaviour has gotten worse. Sometimes I even question my own conciousness or reality. I believe I am being hyper paranoid about it. Is there any guidance or counsel anyone can lend me? Thankyou ",Schizophernia
"Not sure? I don't know if this is right to post here or anywhere but I'm just not sure about what is real. I seen a psychiatrist and he said I could potentially be schizophrenic but I feel like he didn't actually believe what I was saying and has prescribed me placebos. I know that sounds exactly like what someone would probably say but I just don't know. Like he knew I had been reading about it and was condescending for that, and he said things like ""we're going to batter you with testing. We'll do so many tests on you"" and I just interpret that as him trying to scare me into admitting im not being truthful? (even though I am)

I don't hear voices, I hear other people around me say things but I don't think they actually say them, I think I make it up in my mind when I don't fully hear what they say. But even knowing that, I can't shake the vividness of the experiences. They've caused me to think I smell bad almost constantly when around others. I have grand ideas that dissipate in interest in a matter of days. I mumble my words a lot if I'm feeling social pressure/anxiety at the time. I cant think of anything else but there's been more shit like this.

"My cousin who has paranoid schizophrenia, was arrested at his assisted care facility yesterday Hi redditors, 

I don't know where else to post but this I'm hoping a kind soul who knows or who has been in similar circumstances can provide advice. I am trying to gather numbers for possible places where my cousin might be at. He was arrested yesterday for what I would assume is battery(took a hammer and attacked a person) at his assisted care facility but there was no record of him at the local city police station/jail. I found his incident number and it said ""Mental Health"". I'm wondering if he was directly was put on a 5150 hold at the nearby hospital. There's also the possibility that he was directly transferred to the county jail but again I'm really new at this stuff. 

Does anyone know if it's possible he might be a hospital rather than a city jail? My second question is could he have been sent to another city jail or just automatically sent to the county jail? He is currently off meds, addicted to meth, and malnourished so maybe they took him to the hospital. ",Schizophernia
"I think my cousin might be schizophrenic, I don't know how to help him Two years ago my cousin's (22m) personality completely changed. He used to be a funny, joyful guy who was great to be around. Now he is humorless & emotionless. When he does laugh, it's usually weird and not in response to anything actually funny. He started sending me strange, cryptic messages all the time. These messages would be LONG and usually involve things like spirituality and supernatural sounding stuff involving nature. He started using big words in all of his speech and writing, like he was trying to emulate what he thinks an intellectual sounds like. It makes communicating with him really difficult because you can never understand anything he's talking about, and if you press him to explain what he means he'll just say more meaningless cryptic stuff. He wasn't into anything like this before he changed. At first I thought he was acting strange as a joke but after months of this behaviour it's obvious this is just his personality now.

He's frightening to be around. It feels like he could do anything at anytime and there's no way to influence his decision making. He frequently ignores other peoples boundaries. For example, he'll decide he wants to come over to my place, and he'll pester me about it for days until he eventually just decides to show up. He came over to my place on new years eve and ended up staying for a couple weeks, without any sort of communication with me about it. I was okay with it, but I did have to kick him out so he would finally leave - it didn't matter how heavy my hints were, I had to straight up tell him to leave. And while he was here there was an absolute laundry list of weird shit he did. Like, opening the window in the guest room in the middle of winter and leaving it open after he left! He also went into one of my friends phones and sent my friends gf an insane text as ""a prank"".

Another example of him being scary: I was driving with him a couple months ago and he'd randomly start speeding like crazy. We're talking double the speed limit and he'd just do it, despite it obviously scaring me. 

I really have no idea what could be going on. Schizophrenia is the only lead I have at the moment. I've thought about calling my aunt and talking to her about it, but I don't even know where to start with that.",Schizophernia

"Immigrant issues Hi all, new to the sub but it seems like you guys have an incredible community here and hoping to ask for your help.

My mother is a wonderful, sweet lady who immigrated from south India with her family to the USA about 15 years ago.  She had her first symptoms while here and, as commonly happens in the Indian community, they went untreated for a long time.  She finally found a psychiatrist and her symptoms stabilized on risperidone.  For the last 10 or so years, she has gotten by, but (as expected) is somewhat detached and disengaged from the rest of us.  She does her very best, but the medication and her symptoms have left her unable to improve her English, hold a steady job, or find a hobby she enjoys.  She recently had a backslide after a medication change and some symptoms returned, causing her to alienate many friends - thankfully she is now improving and will hopefully be back at baseline soon.

My question is: any suggestions on how we can get her help with getting a bit more integrated and finding her something to do with her time?  I imagine many immigrants have similar issues.  She does speak English but not extremely well, can't drive, and is willing to try anything.  Anyone we can hire, services we can look into, organizations that can help?  We are happy with her psychiatric care for now, just want to help her get back on her feet.  We are willing to pay for the help as well.  If it helps, she's located in the St. Louis area.

"How to connect with someone with schizophrenia I'm 20 y/o male in college. My Dad is a paranoid schizophrenic. He has always been disconnected from reality a bit, it's never been too bad except for a year or two when I was younger and his meds stopped working and he was put in a clinic twice for awhile. Otherwise he usually reserves himself to focusing on tv or reading, usually blocking out (or not being able to see) everything else, and often misses stuff happening around him. Because of two bad parents, I've grown up pretty socially awkward and have some anxiety from it, but up until now I haven't shown any signs of having schizophrenia yet at least.

My question is about how I can connect with someone who has schizophrenia, such as my Dad? We've never been close and I only see him a few times a year. I've never acknowledged him having schizophrenia and honestly the only reason I know he does is because my mom told me when I was younger, a little bit after his first episode. He's never seemed like a bad guy (My Mom has talked a lot of shit about him, but she's also known for lying a whole bunch so idk how much I can believe it.) He and I were never close when I was young, part of it is because my Mom told me crap to make me hate him which I feel terrible about because he didn't deserve it. I've been trying to change that when I get time (On top of college and working, sadly it's not that much time.) I would like to talk to him about having it, to see if it runs in the family or when he got it just to satisfy my curiosity at least, but I don't know how open he would be to talking about it, or if it could trigger some attack or something.

"Hearing Voices Groups and Other Strategies I Use Hey all,  


It's been a while since I've been on this sub, mainly because I think I was getting better (I wasn't). I wanted to share what has been helping me lately.

For the past month I've been attending my local Hearing Voices group at the hospital. It was offered to me as part of my attending a clinic here in Melbourne. So far so good. I've made friends with everyone in the group. We share about our voices, delusions and anxieties in a non-judgemental safe space. Everything is confidential, which is why I'm not going to tell you about my friends' experiences and we can trust in each other because everyone in the group has been through a similar journey. There is a clinician who attends the group just to monitor if one of us is in crisis. 

At group lately, I've been sharing my poetry and songs, and it has helped me so much! I'm writing songs almost every day and singing all the time to drown out the voices. I also have been listening to lots of new music to inspire me and keep me focused.

I have been smoking cigarettes a fair bit though and I would like to cut down - the HV group is full of people who smoke but they all understood when I told them I wanted to cut down. Today I found out there is a link between tobacco use and psychosis, which is a very good reason for me to quit.

I hope you can find a hearing voices group in your area - if not, you could start one if you talk to the clinicians at your local hospital or ward. Finding a group of people so similar to me has helped me in the best way possible this past month.

That's not to say that I'm cured or symptom-less. This week I was really unwell and crying almost every day because of my delusions. It makes it easier to keep on living just to talk about it with my friends at group though.",Schizophernia

"Diagnosed with schizo but symptoms seem unique So I'll try to make this short 

I was diagnosed with schizophrenia last year at the age of 23 after a psychotic episode that ended with the psychward. After doing research and talking to some medical professionals I have noticed differences in the voices I hear and when I hear them.

To start with I mainly have psychotic episodes when I am at home, and a few other times at work or out just walking around. But mainly just at home. When at home i hear three distinct voices 1.evil woman voice that resembles my step mom this voice is the instigator of terror always making me paranoid. 2. My step sister who can be good but is usually also judgemental and causes paranoia. 3. My father who tends to stick up for me but can also just as equally get angry depending on what the other two voices tell them. The voices all communicate together in their own specific way though that usually ends with me getting put down and paranoid. 

I guess where I'm getting at is the 3 voices in my head(at home) literally have conversations about me non stop. Now if I'm in a completely comfortable situation  with best friends or certain family the voices can almost completely die out. But say I'm alone in my room, the voices can break me down. 

Does anyone else experience this? Obviously anxiety and even white noise has something to do with this but I'm not even sure general schizophrenia is a good diagnosis. I know you all probably can't legally diagnose but thought I'd see if anyone else experiences similarities.

I tried a few anti psychotic drugs but to be honest did not like how they made me feel in general thanks

Tldr: i have developed three voices that reassemble the people i live with. They talk to each other but seem to be situational and definitely environmental. When i am comfortable with the situation these voices can die out entirely until i become anxious or paranoid again. Would this still be considered schizophrenia?",Schizophernia

Has anyone had positive experiences from going on medication? What kind did you go on? 

I practice yoga and (try) to mediate. I do so daily, for the most part, and have for almost 2 years now. I have been very confused lately if my symptoms are getting worse or if I am just experiencing symptoms of spiritual enlightenment. I think they're very related though in a way. Do you guys have insight on this? 

I am also left extremely confused as to what I should do for my future. I want to protect myself from any suffering that can be avoided and take care of myself, yet live freely and surrender to what's supposed to happen. I do not want to live my whole life fighting and live a double life, as I know I could do easily, yet, suffer greatly. What kind of jobs do you guys have? How do you support yourself financially? I have a bachelor's degree in communications, but find the jobs that I would get with it are too much for me in a way, that I wouldn't be able to dedicate enough time for processing the things I go through, therefore leading me to stress and then leading to a lot more disfunction and a less sustainable lifestyle. I don't need much. I've dreamed about living in my jeep but don't think she will be alive for much longer lol. 

I currently live with my parents. Living here makes the symptoms worse because I feel more isolated as they seem to forget or somewhat deny that I have it or am suffering.  I have an Instagram account (@victoriamaceachin if you're interested, message me and say you met me through this!) that I've used to spread positive words and things that help me vent, in a way, and let it out in a positive way. It's helped with my mainframe a ton, but has also added other stresses too. I've shared that I suffer from STPD on there, which gave me a ton of anxiety but also feel like it set me free too in ways. In some ways it feels like its word vomit, and sometimes feels good; other times not so good, so I've been pulling back and trying to just find other outlets. But they're not as satisfying as actually connecting to people.

I don't want to live this way - unable to live freely in a place that's supposed to be a home, or not able to talk openly to the people I live with. I feel like I lose my mind the second there is resistance, and then tend to get very very distressed and stuck.

I want to work on living on my own. I have in college and know I can do it again - I enjoy taking care of things very much. I just don't have the means to support myself in America right now. I have a job online teaching English as a foreign language to kids in Beijing. I will be traveling soon and have been considering living abroad permanently, but cannot decide where would accept me and wonder if that's what I really want. Do you have any advice?

And anyone become diagnosed with STPD whose developed schizophrenia? What's the transition like? I'm trying to brace myself, if that's my future. I feel a pit in my stomach, every time I think about it coming true and am very scared.

Also, if anyone out there who is reading this is seeking a positive (yet realistic) outlook on their own situation, whatever it may be, I'm most definitely here for you &lt;3

"Not sure, very confused I don at really know much about schizophrenia but I don at have hallucinations but I smoked weed the other day and I have been for about 4 years but for some reason I come home and it starts hitting me hard.

"Advice on friendships? These past 5 or so years I've found it very difficult to make friends or keep friends.  I often feel like people are laughing at me or think that I'm creepy.  It doesn't help that for a 2 year period I went without talking to anyone and no one really seemed to actually care that I wasn't connecting with anyone.  A couple of years ago I was stuck in this weird emotional period where I didn't really even feel like I had any emotions.  Which worked out for me a little better since at least then I didn't act ridiculous.  (I'm diagnosed schizophrenia with a mood disorder)  People would compliment me on how great I was at managing my emotions, but really it was just me not feeling anything most of the time.  

Recently I've just found it extremely difficult to keep people in my life.  No one seems to really care if I'm around or not.  I've found that those who claimed they will be there for me no matter what have turned their backs on me.  I've reached a point where I really don't trust anyone.  I've stopped trying to be friends with people because it always feels like I'm the only one trying.  I'm not even sexually interested in anyone/anything (asexual).  

To be honest, I just really don't know what to do.  I feel like I'm really lost with myself.  I haven't been sleeping almost at all recently, which hasn't really been a big big deal but it I think it probably makes things worse.  


Any advice would help, really.  I think I just need a direction to move in because I clearly don't make great decisions for myself.  I think I kinda moved off my main question, but it's all kind of relevant I suppose.  Sorry if this isn't something people should post and what not...",Schizophernia
"Please send hugs to my son aka alphachopsticks. He's on his way to EPS. It's been building for several weeks, but tonight the command voices got to be too much to bear. I call him my hero, and tonight I am beyond grateful that he trusts me enough that he asked me to call 911.

He was diagnosed almost exactly 3 years ago, after a years long prodromal phase. We have learned to recognize the warning signs of danger and have managed to stay out of the hospital for about 2 1/2 years. Tonight the voices were too insistent, but thankfully, he had enough insight to know that he couldn't fight this one on his own.

"Possible schizophrenia in my 56 year old mom. The past year my mom has gone down hill pretty bad. She went from sweet, funny, talkative and happy to scared, delusional, paranoid and angry. She swears she hears us talking bad about her when we are not talking at all. She swears im in the other room when im really 6 hours away. She thinks the fbi live next door and their goal is to make her crazy and kill herself. Sometimes she willa agree that the voices and delusions aren't real and then 10 minutes later she is very determined they are 100 percent real and there is no way of talking her out of it. She got to the point where she kept calling and saying she needs to kill herself to feel better and then my husband who she is living with while he goes to college in another city, found her in the middle if the night trying to slit her wrists. She has been in the hospital since monday. She refused to put me or my sister on the contact list for the doctors because she heard us in the next room talking bad about her. I cant get info on her condition from the dr or social worker because of this but I can still call her daily. She was refusing medication to help with the voices because she believed they are real. But she agreed to take them today. She did tell me that when she was taking a shower this morning that the nurses put a video if her showering on the big screen for the whole hospital to see. She also swears we are pressing charges on her for a very terrible act that she thinks we said she did. Which we didn't and know she didnt do.

I developed schizophrenia/schizoaffective two years ago. I was super depressed about it and gained 100lbs but I ave been stable on meds for about 5 months now, refused to take them before. 

At first I was on trilafon 16mg, abilify 50mg, lithium 1200mg, 200 amantadine, 10 mg selegiline. 

Now my doctors at UCLA want to lower the lithium or get rid of it all together, not sure and do this 

Cariprazine (vraylar)
Selegiline 
Amandatine 
Galantamine 
Modafinil

I know this is like a dream stack for a lot ig people, my docs are very open minded 

I also wanna do hormone therapy so I am upper normal for estrogen (I am a woman) and hgh because those are neuroprotective 

Also take fish oil, multivitamin 

I wanna also ask for contrave (diet pill with wellbutrin and nalytroxene

"My boyfriend is schizophrenic, I am not. We see the same figure. I have been with my boyfriend going on three years, and have known he is schizophrenic for the past two. He kept info about it to himself up until we moved in together, and a new hallucination gives me the heebie jeebies.

I will catch him staring off into the dark or at dimly lit areas for seemingly no reason, with a terrified look on his face. He finally explained to me last night that he has began seeing a new figure and he as scared. He as been seeing the same things for most of his life, so he as grown to cope with them, but not with this one yet. 

This new creature is a dark six-seven feet tall figure that likes to lurk around the corners in our apartment and stare at him. He describes it as an almost bird/humanoid with red glowing eyes that just stares, nothing else.

This would normally be terrifying to think about alone, but I ave been seeing the same thing. 

I don at know if this is even the right sub for this, but I just need advice from somebody. 

Sometimes I all see it at the same time as he does, but usually when I am home alone. It will be peeking at me by our closet door, only it as eyes visible in the dark. I all catch a glimpse after I shut off my hallway lights. My cats will stay away from the areas I see it in. 

I have been seeing it before he told me about his experience with it. It is new. I pushed it off as my medication messing with me.

"Dating with schizophrenia This is you.

Dates guy last year, stays in 5 month long relationship with him.

Is cheated on twice (that we know of for sure, yet sources from dating apps say way more then that).

Forgives him because he was cheated on before in his last relationship (bullshit reason for a shitty thing to do)

Booked vacation down south, nice place to go visit, recommends it well. Booked in cash so no way to cancel vacation with ex (This is approximately 3 months in the relationship, I stay with him not to make the vacation shitty)

Breaks up with him because of apathy (not knowing the other times I was cheated on).

Does he pay me back? (Because I paid for it by asking my dad for money) Yes! Quite nice of him actually. 

Is he currently owing me more money? Yes. Does my father want his money back from when I asked a loan from him? No. So technically my ex shouldn at owe me anything because the original dept from my father is forgiven. Have I told my ex about this? No. Do I feel bad that he as working 3 jobs trying to pay out his debts (not just my debt but from phone and credit card bills)? Not really no. Do I work full time for a minimum wage job that is very demanding? Yes so I can relate.

Did he (my ex) take advantage of me for the fact that my dad has a lot of spare money? Yes. Making extra money for a trip that was basically free, do you feel guilty about it? A little bit, so maybe me and my ex are even in that way. Hard to say(but I still want him finish paying me up). 
    
Today, my prospect of love with someone is low but there is hope, but you know (bitch better have my money because I am saving for my next tattoo).

In short I don at feel like dating due to this, it kind of sucks in its own way.

"Confusion about my mental case Family has a log side of mental issues my grandma is fully schizophrenic and has to be monitored and My father is bipolar with borderline schizophrenia. I am currently 19, diagnosed bipolar type one with extreme anxiety. I was diagnosed when i was 16 cause thats when the depression really hit was that year but the anxiety was always there it was just always regarded as me being shy. But im on the line of thinking i have schizophrenia or have it coming. When im alone i always feel like something is watching me and i truly believe it. But if you ask me about it ill shrug it off and say your right nothing is there. I have had experiences as a kid where i just felt evil in the room and spiritual things happen that make my body chill. Even as im typing this right now i have a feeling someTHING is watching me just out of my peri feral. I know schizophrenic people hear voices but that only has happened to me a couple of times and hasn at happened in months. Only voice i hear tho is screaming banshees just women yelling as loud as they can, the last occurrence was last year around September. I also only have one friend, reason being is because ill talk to someone for a while, then completely cut them off like not even answer text and i feel ok with it no remorse. There is a little remorse ill get sad every now and then about it but my head says they cant backstab you now they are gone. And when i meet new people anymore its not meeting its me analyzing the entire time, me analyzing if they are a threat to me if I befriended them or (even tho i know its wrong as fuck) if i could use them to my advantage and then cut them off. Lastly the thing that worries me is, i act like a good person, i get along with everyone just fine and im friendly at work, but dont get on my bad side. I think about hurting people way to much. The other day someone pissed me off at work and i argued and cursed for about 10 minutes before he walked off i have a really explosive temper. But after that i was thinking about cutting his throat. I think about vulgar stuff i know is wrong. I think about killing people daily, cutting their throats, hanging them by hooks, literally cereal killer stuff. And my head says hell yes fuck them cut their cutting throat and let them drain almost like im... hyped for it?

"Schizophrenia is the result of ENHANCED brain function  

Schizophrenia results from enhanced brain function.

What is keeping people from understanding this state-of-consciousness is the belief that schizophrenia is the result of reduced brain function.

It is the OPPOSITE.

In the case of schizophrenia, all of the delusions and hallucinations that are reported are not delusions or hallucinations at all. They are actual existences in the visual and audio fields that are not perceptible to normal brains operating at the default, much-lower-function level at which you are currently operating.

There is a solution to the problem.  

The answer lies with N,N -dimethyltryptamine (DMT), an endogenous neurotransmitter that is active predominantly in infancy and childhood and which presence is gradually diminished as puberty approaches.  It is practically inoperative by early adulthood.  DMT is very similar to serotonin.

In schizophrenia, the endogenous production of DMT continues, which is why schizophrenia gets reported in early adulthood.  In the few people who's bodies continue to produce DMT, ""childhood"" continues, and parents and friends and teachers cannot understand why this is so.  So parents and friends and teachers try to ""force"" the schizophrenic to ""grow up,"" but the schizophrenic cannot grow up, because they have DMT in their brains.  Eventually parents and friends and teachers get frustrated with the schizophrenic and tell them they have a problem, and the schizophrenic feels horrible about constantly being told that what they are seeing isn't there and that they have a problem.  This spirals into a horrible situation where nobody around the schizophrenic believes what he is saying, when everything the schizophrenic is reporting is the god's honest truth.  

Consider this and see if it aligns with your own experience of schizophrenia.  The question becomes, what are you going to do about it?  I'm happy to answer more questions here.  Dr. Rolland Griffiths at John's Hopkins University has studied DMT and may be headed in the right direction.  Eventually he and other researchers might verify this discovery, and the problem of schizophrenia may be solved.  ",Schizophernia

"How can I help my mom? My mother has recently been diagnosed with schizophrenia. However, she doesn't trust the doctor and refuses to take her medicines. I, my sister, my dad, the psychiatrist and a few other relatives tried to persuade her. We even got a religious 'Guru', who my mother has extreme respect for and recently met to tell her to take her meds. She just refuses. She's very religious and thinks she isn't some ordinary person, and believes that God tells her not to take her meds. She has some delusions and is very suspicious of people in general. She thinks our house is bugged and has a very weird Google search history, like she's having a conversation with Google. My sister and father are having a hard time with her in the house. I'm studying engineering in a different city, and therefore, cannot go home to help except on vacations. The psychiatrist had told us to slip in the meds in her food, but due to her suspicious nature and the bitter taste, she found out about them. We managed to convince her for a short while to take the meds and that her condition was better (which it visibly was) due to the meds, but now she's again refusing. This is causing my sister a lot of stress. Is there anyway in which I can help my mother/ convince her to take her meds?

I understand that it should be a personal choice to take medicines. However, her behavior was quite troublesome when she wasn't on the medication. She used to tell everyone to whisper so that their conversation couldn't be recorded and write some stuff on Google that leads me to think that she might behave self-harmingly, maybe not physically, but at least mentally.

I was taking Aripiprazole , Escitalopram and Naltraxeone back then. A few months ago, I went to another psychiatric facility and they did some really oldschool tests on me ( Rorschach, TAT, MMPI)  and said that I might have Schizotypal personality disorder with schizophrenia unspecified (non-organic psychosis)...but finally decided that I am on the high functioning autism spectrum... this has changed a lot of things (aripiprazole with setraline) and even though I was skeptical of this too...my [RAADS](https://www.aspietests.org/raads/questions.php?show=b3b3eac9356348&amp;locale=en_GB) results say I might be on the AS...

I can't tell if I'm reading into things too much or actually just being openly mocked. Hallucinations aren't super common. Sometimes it's music, sometimes I'll have a thousand voices on repeat in my head and one slips into my ear (from thought to actually hearing), and most common is I hear the TV when it's off. Off and unplugged, no one else home, no noise from neighbors, but I hear the general cadence and tone of voices. It's usually sitcoms. I've sat and stared at an unplugged TV ""listening"" to a full episode of Friends. I also smell things everywhere I go, not from any direction and always a bad smell, it only lasts a few seconds but I've seen others cover their noses and heard them attribute it to me.

"Bringing my spouse to psych appointment My therapist mentioned it but I also thought maybe it would be beneficial for my husband to come along. Mostly because he has been pretty reluctant to hear any diagnoses.
The problem partially because lots of ones were mentioned as the doctor's figure it out.

My family doctor told me to mention Bipolar to my therapist/psych, I did but hadn't looked into it. 

Then I went into psychosis. Then had my Abilify increased. My brain continued to trick me for about 6 more weeks then my psych mentioned he thinks I am schizotypal but not ruling out schiziphrenia. It's been a month since my last appointment now. And since then I've done lots of reading as well as self reflection. And I don't feel very sure about schizotypal.

What symptoms aside from hallucinations and delusions were noteworthy to your diagnoses?

I just want a diagnoses so I can start moving forward. This last six months have been hell.

How did your spouses and family react to your diagnoses?

My husband doesn't seem to believe what I am saying so I figured if I brought him to an appointment maybe they could repeat what I've said but in a man's doctor voice then he will take it seriously. But at the moment he thinks my mental health is a joke.

"State Guardianship so early? My loved one (35m) has been delusional since Christmas 2018. He's only gotten an official diagnosis two weeks ago. In the last few months he's been hospitalized 5 times. 3 of those times were against his will. The last 2 times have been his decision because he's suicidal. His delusions are triggering his suicidal thoughts because his delusions involve people killing him in truly horrific ways, so he feels if he kills himself he'll save going through all the suffering and terrifying shit. Anyways! This doctor in the BHU of the hospital is telling him she's going to file for state Guardianship. He's only been going through this for less than 6 months!? During this time he's not been medicated consecutively for any real amount of time because, once  again his delusions had him thinking the medications stopped him from communicating with God. We are past all that now and hopefully for good but he's still got the paranoid delusions about people wanting to kill him. He's managing that as best he can in the hospital and I feel like things are improving but the doctor is now pulling this crap on him and us. He doesn't have ssi or ss yet but I'm trying to get him planning and making goals. This is all so new and scary but I just can't imagine them stripping him of his rights without even giving him time to stabilize on his medications?! His father is paranoid schizophrenic and that's what they've diagnosed him with. He doesn't want to hear it though but he is complying with the treatment now with support from me and his family. I have a child with him and only want the best for him but I can't be his guardian and I really don't think he needs one.

"I need a little guidance. First things first I'm not diagnosed with schizophrenia but I am diagnosed with BPD. But I've been seeing and hearing things that I know aren't real but at the same time I'm not so sure. I've tried to find information with hallucinations tied to BPD but there wasn't a whole lot I could find. 

Something I experience a lot is seeing things in the corner of my eye and when I go to look, it's gone. 
I also experience hearing multiple voices in my head that tell me all sorts of nasty things about me, convince me I'm being watched when I'm in public and tell me that people only want me around to use me,  hurt me or pity me.

I also experience very strong auditory hallucinations with things away from me, like for example yesterday I heard 6 different planes fly over my apartment building. It's common to hear one plane fly over and you can see it when you look out the window and it'll also shake the walls but I couldn't see them yesterday and they didn't shake the walls. But I was convinced 6 different planes flew over one after the other. And I was mad no one else in the apartment block were as concerned about it as me. I could hear the neighbours laughing and chatting on the ground floor but no one sounded concerned or questioned it. Im convinced it happened.

I also have episodes where I have tactile hallucinations. It's usually a paramedic that I feel is there (I dunno why) or a human male like figure. I've never seen him but I could tell you exactly what he looks like because his presence is so damn strong.

Something else I've been experiencing a lot very recently is not feeling like I'm apart of my body. Like I know I'm blinking or moving my fingers but it doesn't feel like they're my eyes or my fingers. It's if like my ""soul"" is 90% detached from my body and every movement or thought I have is foreign. That also includes where I am at the time, like my room isn't my room or my bed isn't my bed. 

I've also shut out all of my friends and acquaintances, I deleted all of my social medias a month ago, changed my number and have tried to go off the grid as much as possible.

I'm worried this is going to get worse but I'm so incredibly scared that if I told a medical professional what I'm experiencing they'll say that it's all a delusion and I'm making it up. I'm scared they'll say ""oh but people with schizophrenia don't know they have it so you're lying"". But I know that's not true? Is that true? 
For me personally I sometimes know what I'm experiencing isn't real, I don't know how I know that but I just do. And sometimes I'm convinced it's real and my partner has to tell me it's not. 

I'm scared of being labelled as crazy or a liar and I don't know what to do. 
I'm sorry if my post is in the wrong subreddit or I'm crossing any boundaries. I'm just so scared and I would really like some guidance on what I should do from here. 

Thank you for reading and I hope you all find something to smile about today.

"Just finished from another visit need someones input please! I have been suffering for a long time of paranoia , depression and voices in my head. It has been a struggle.

I started taking drugs, heroin, meth, lsd, weed and so many others but now I'm almost 1 year clean. Even though some drugs helped and others worsened my condition severely but I'm done with that now. 

I was on paliperidone 6mg for some time and olanzapine, antidepressants (duloxetine) and xanax

But got no improvement whatsoever today he increased my paliperidone to 12 mg and gave me 90 mg of duloxetine , 2mg xanax and he also removed olanzapine completely. 

What do you guys take and what has helped you and how long would i feel any improvement and will i ever have some peace in my mind without all these conversations in my head!?

"Help playing the role of a paranoid schizophrenic? I'm playing a kind subservant family man who, through the incredible power of tabletop RPGs, has quite literally been injected with schizophrenia. Specifically paranoid schizophrenia.

Personality wise, he's a hard working family man. He lost his wife recently, and still mourning the end of his marriage, is determined to provide for his only daughter as best he can. The character is heavily inspired by Walter White.

So, any advice on how his illness will impact his decision making? I expect a buffer period before he starts listening to the advice of his paranoia in earnest. But when will that be? What if again through the power of tabletop RPGs, the voices in his head turn out to be right on several occasions? Will that increase or decrease his trust in them? Will his love and trust in his daughter override any feelings of suspicion towards her? Will his drive to protect her be abandoned when he doesn't feel he can trust her anymore, or will they become twisted into a ""protecting her from herself"" mentality?

"Delusion of Unreality Since January, I have been extremely anxious about developing psychosis or schizophrenia. I have been going to a therapist, havent yet begun any medication, but it doesnt seem to be helpful. Hes just a free university therapist who seems great at helping those with stress, but not those with anxiety disorders, OCD, let alone psychotic illnesses. I go through phases of feeling good, like I have control of my obsessions, other times, for a week or two at a time, im 100% im developing schizophrenia, and ill spend hours a day reading stories, taking tests, and looking up symptoms. My most recent wave of OCD came from a story my good friend told me about his brother, who is currently experiencing his first psychotic episode after taking LSD for the first time. He believed he had to start a business, or else the mafia would come kill him, and he got incredibly obsessed with all the different businesses he had to start. He was hospitalized, and his positive symptoms are improving, but negative symptoms are still affecting him gravely. Anyways, I have this constant feeling(?) or thought(?) that the world doesnt exist. That im in a dream, or simulation, or something. Just that nothing exist, nobody but me has consciousness. I havent ever firmly believed this one, maybe a product of just reading too many experiences, but that others are just actors, or put there by God for me to live in this world alone. I get this feeling, or thought(?) even when im feeling calm. And normally I have just attributed this to depersonalization or derealization, but I looked through the CAARMS test, which psychiatrists use to calculate an individuals risk of psychosis prodrome. Most of the questions I dont score on, no hallucinations, not really any delusions, but the one that I would consider that I fall under, is nihlistic thoughts. Thoughts that the world or one's self does not exist. And it is scored based on ones insight, whether they shake it off immediately at a 0, up to a 5, where the person firmly believes it, and it causes much distress. I rated myself around a 3-4. I tried googling around for this type of delusion, which is what brought me to this page. Not certain whether this is just derealization, existential OCD, a slight indicator of psychotic risk, or even just normal human experience. I smoked weed around 5 times a week from ages 14-16, tried K2 Spice, MDMA once, and was drugged with something (think PCP?) around that age. I quit doing all drugs around 16 after getting panic attacks when smoking, and had developed contamination OCD that people would drug my drinks or food as a joke. (another possible indicator of psychotic risk?) Now 22, Male, a month away from graduating college. I feel quite social, I am in a fraternity, I have friends, I have a job lined up, but I cant shake the fear that I will lose my insight, and lose everything. I guess the only thing anybody can really offer, is to just visit a psychiatrist, and/or try some medication, which I will do once i graduate and begin making money. But for now, I get to just ruminate. I just wanted to know if anybody can relate, or has some information/education, since everything I read on my own is ""the worst case scenario""",Schizophernia

"Some things to help someone deal with schizophrenia living alone? Hi there, i didnt see this specific information in the sticky so i hope its okay if i ask. Before i start, i am going to help her get therapy and medication if she'll let me. And im sorry this is a long read,

 tldr; what tips for someone living alone with schizophrenia and how can i help? Will technology make it worse with someone who is hearing voices on a phone?

Ive posted before, when my mom was first developing schizophrenia and was showing capgras symptoms. 

Now, due to financial and housing issues, she moved away from where i live, and i cant afford to move with her. She has family out there, and my sister helped her move but they dont understand mental illness and i dont think its helping.

Shes called the police multiple times, is losing medication and thinks someone is breaking in, and is getting phone calls from people that arent calling her, including a version of myself. She ended up walking to a gas station alone today because of a phone call from someone she didnt know. My sister had to call family to pick her up. And i worry shes going to get into trouble and my family is talking about forcing her to get committed. I DO NOT want that, she has begged me before not to let anyone do that and i refuse to unless she is absolutely going to hurt herself.

Im saving up to go visit asap, and i want to help her. She has depression as well and cant stay motivated enough to take care of herself. Ive been there and wanted to show her some of the techniques that help me on my bad days. (Meal prepping, meal logs, and general information about food and healthy eating, and also caffeine alternatives because she drinks 8 glasses of coffee a day and is not supposed to with her medication)

But i was also thinking, she sits in silence alot and i know it doesnt help with paranoia when youre home alone. I was thinking of getting her an Amazon echo, and setting her up with her favorite music and some podcasts about stuff she likes. Is this an okay idea? Im scared that it might make her nervous, shes a little scared of technology and her phone doesnt seem to be helping. 

She was also talking about getting an animal to adopt, she has chronic pain so im not sure a dog that needs to be walked would be okay. Would a cat be a good companion? 

Shes also very defensive about all of this and wont talk to anyone about whats really happening on her good days, which worries me greatly cause i cant tell if shes actually okay or not

Im sorry if any of this seems unfair or insensitive, im just so worried about her and i want her to be okay. I love her very much. If you have any tips or advice i would greatly appreciate it. ",Schizophernia

"I can't feel any emotions, is it unique or common? I have seen it listed in schizophrenia symptoms but I don't know if other people are experiencing the same thing. All my emotions, like feeling happy, angry, sad, or feeling empathy are gone. I used to feel those when I watch movies and stuff like that, but nowadays it's all rational for me. 

I went to my psychiatrist and told him what happened to me: A voice told me to say a sentence three times and something changed in my brain, just like that, and from that moment (back in 2017) I stopped feeling emotions. Sadly I still feel emotional pain, but without sadness attached.


My psychiatrist said they may never return, and after two years I am still in the same situation. It sucks because you need to feel emotions to feel satisfaction, without them the world is bland and I am filled with a sense of apathy everyday. I also see that I have grown to be colder with my opinions, now it's very easy for me not to give a shit about other people even though I still remember I am supposed to. 

I don't know, at first I thought it would be an advantage for me but the only thing I can think of is that I am not as suicidal as I used to be because now I am too rational to kill myself even though I sort of feel uncomfortable with the idea of living past a certain age.

"What to call myself / my mental illness? So I had my first psychotic episode last year and ended up in the psych ward but I did not receive a diagnosis of schizophrenia despite being put on an anti-psychotic for about 8 months. Now that I am off medication my life as improved, however I still struggle with what I ad describe as negative symptoms of schizophrenia as well as cognitive issues. If I smoke weed I get pretty fucked up and depressing thoughts rushing in and none of the enjoyment I used to have before my episode, so I ave stopped that, especially being off antipsychotics it as too risky. Although I maybe wouldn at call it a voice (and I have had voices so I know what that as like) I pretty much live with this impulse or maybe it as like an intrusive thought? to attack people when I am in social situations or even just walking past people on the street... it actually makes me flinch when it happens and I often feel like I have to clench my fists or put my hands in my pockets. Goes without saying probably but I would never act on these thoughts. I also get startled on occasion by things in the corner of my vision, but my hallucinations are extremely light, more like momentarily misreading things around me.

So that as me, and I know I don at have it nearly as rough as a lot of people, but I do feel I am living with something that impacts my life. But without positive symptoms rearing their heads unless I am high or worse tripping, and without an actual diagnosis of schizophrenia, I don at really know what to call myself. I thought of psychosis survivor but it sounds more than a little dramatic, and to be honest it really would just be easier to call myself schizophrenic or mildly schizophrenic, but then again I don at want to be diminishing the experience of schizophrenic and schizo-affective people who ave had multiple episodes, live with frequent voices and visual hallucinations, are taking heavy doses of medication, dealing with tardive dyskinesia from said medication, etc.

I guess what I am asking is, is it okay for me to call myself schizophrenic? Also, I am wondering what you guys think of using the word schizo to refer to yourselves/ourselves.

I am highly aware that it isn at healthy for me, and that it as probably not nearly as bad as I think. But is it? 

I ave never visited doctors about it until recent. I am almost 19. I am on HRT with planned parenthood, and during those visits with the psychologists there, they heavily suggested that I have autism. But, this isn at an official diagnosis. 

I feel like it as true. I have extreme sensory problems. I have intense meltdowns. But the funny thing is, that I feel like I have never struggled socially until the last year.
I have lots of memories as a child of doing weird things, but I was never checked for autism. I almost think these symptoms came up recently.
I don at think autism can just manifest. 

I have confirmed from outside opinions that I have delusions. I feel like everyone in the entire world hates me. Every other peer at my school, I truly believed in my heart that they are PRETENDING to like me.

To be fair, the recent meltdowns happen in private. Maybe I didn at lash at school because I ad be labeled a tard. I don at know. (Thinking about it mid-writing, I can barely remember my life at all. It feels like my memory consists of 3 years total.)

This past year, I have had extreme outbursts of screaming, kicking, clawing, bashing my head... But these NEVER happened at school. Or before at all! Unless I don at remember them. I don at know. They are almost always triggered by something menial, something any other human being would never react violently to. Such as misplacing an item, and failing to find it at all for an extended time. Or being forced to return to a place/situation where I previously had a meltdown.

I go into this intense, cyclical, infinite mindset of want the world to die. I want everything to suffer. I am in agony. I am dying. Kill me. Kill me. Kill me. It hurts. It physically hurts. I literally feel like I am physically dying in those moments. I feel the intense drive to tear my body apart. I wish I could put into words how truly intense this experience is. 

I need SOMEBODY to tell me, does this sound serious? Am I just crazy? Does just crazy exist!? Am I just autistic? 

I am sorry if this is the wrong place to post this. But I really do feel like it set in, and is getting worse. I don at have money to visit 20 psychiatrists. I am desperate for answers. Help. Any insight is appreciated.",Schizophernia
"I have no goals in life When I was younger, I used to take part in modelling contests etc., got featured in the school's newspaper, used to dance on stage for major performances. I also play the piano and the harp nowadays. I have this delusion, or whatever you call it. I always had the idea of live streaming to hundreds of people, becoming a famous singer like Britney spears and shaking my ass on stage like Rita Ora. I started having this belief since I was 15, and was subtly trying to become famous till I was 21. Now I am turning 24 soon, time is running out, and I don't seem to have any concrete/realistic goals in mind. I have a college degree in media/communications and I am making some progress on the piano and harp, so I could do something front-desk and whatnot. But secretly I am harbouring the thought of becoming famous and performing to large crowds. I have mood swings, and I think my pdoc might be giving up on me, since my problem is bigger than it seems. My personality and unshakeable delusion of wanting to chase fame. I think I lean towards the histrionic side, personality wise. Jobless and sad. I think my paranoia, anger etc can be managed by cbt etc., but the core part of me and my delusion is impossible to change. I really have no clue what else I want to do besides become famous and dance provocatively on stage.",Schizophernia
Suicidal I feel very paranoid lately. I feel like people mean me harm and their thoughts stick to the back of my head and make sick and miserable. This makes me feel isolated because I have noone to keep me safe and the feeling of isolation and hostility makes me feel like I don't deserve to be loved and kept safe. I want to harm myself to purge this feeling. I'm starting to get suicidal impulses. I don't know how to cure myself and noone cares for me enough to help. I feel like just giving up. ,Schizophernia
"Terrified that im going backwards. When I was a teenager from 12 and onward, I was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder with psychotic tendencies. I heard things, saw things and so forth.

I'm almost 30 and have been off meds for years with no issues. Two days ago I overheard my fiance saying some things that broke my heart. I confronted her about it and she says that the conversation I heard never happened. Yesterday at work I had a feeling like everyone was saying things to me and would hear them being very negative to me and when I asked them to repeat what they had said thinking I misheard they told me they hadn't said a thing.

Today was worse. My self confidence from the things I thought were said to me is at an all-time low. I'm terrified that these things I dealt with for so long are coming back.

I can't sleep, I can't eat. I really don't know if this is something I can deal with again.

I'm getting married in two days and maybe I'm just under an immense amount of stress but honestly it's not a very large or traditional thing we're doing so I haven't felt any actual stress about it.

I'm afraid to tell my fiance about this as she has an anxiety disorder and I don't want to scare her.

"Symptom progression during the week? 
Hello friends, 

I ave lurked this subreddit for some time now, just want to say thank you for being open, transparent, and encouraging.  It as helped me feel not so alone. 

I debated on asking this question, but really needed to get some feedback: do any of you feel that your symptoms become more intense as you go through the week? 

A little background: most of my bloodline has had history of multiple mental/behavioral health diagnoses. So combine that with life as crazy and occasionally traumatic circumstances, I ave been living with (what I believe to be) schizophrenia for years. I never quite acknowledged it growing up, but this year has certainly gotten much more severe. So I ave finally made the decision to get help and see a doctor.  

Anywho, I don at know if this relates to anyone, but it seems like I get more instead symptoms as my week progresses. I am assuming it as stress induced, but it makes no sense to me that I ad experience waves likes this weekly. I all do my best to explain: 

Mondays - I am a little on edge, but not too unrelaxed, cautious at work because I am fearful of how my movements will be perceived, not a whole ton of voices, no visuals. 

Tuesday - feeling okay, still cautious but glad I made it through Monday without freaking out. Voices are rather persistent, but I am a little more focused on meeting work deadlines. 

Wednesday - the workload is really piling up and I just can at seem to focus or organize my thoughts. Nervous my boss will notice that I ave been on the same file for 2 hours, but damnit if only he knew I was doing my absolute most darnedest best. F*ck. Voices are incredibly antagonizing and I am starting to see shadows in my peripherals. 

Thursday - omg, the voices are a little louder, inaudible but damn it as loud. I start to get a headache and earache almost. The shadows have now moved closer and they follow so closely behind me. They are also 109% behind the bathroom stall, which is annoying. Thankfully they don at stick around while I pee.  I have to finish my work, I need some sort of progression.  Just have to do my best and ignore the psychosis. I still have today and tomorrow to get through. 

Friday - I am really on edge. I can at wait for the day to be over so that I can go home and not focus so much of my energy on looking and acting normal. I. Am. Binge. Eating. I am talking everything under the sun. I don at know why but I have to do it. Work is almost impossible to do, my brain is out of wack and my hallucinations are so distracting. But I continue acting and find myself counting down til clock out time. I pretty much I feel like a corvette being continually revved up behind the starting line just waiting to go.  

For the past 2 almost 3 weeks, I become completely unhinged Friday night when I get home, and my hallucinations are absolutely haunting. I lock myself in the a room and I just let loose. I am screaming, I am crying, I can at control my facial movements, I am pacing or in a fetal position, and my voices are so loud it as deafening. The shadows are behind my back and every time I turn to catch them they disappear to another part of the room.  After praying for my life I make it out of the room and my husband is there to keep me grounded. 

Saturday comes along and I have to put my entire life on pause so that I can decompress and prevent another episode. By the end of the night I am feeling more lucid. 

Sunday is my favorite day because I get to go to church.  My voices at this point sound suppressed behind a closed door and just sound like white noise at this point. I like to think that as God holding them back for me. My visuals ??feel? residual, no shadows, just spiders at a distance. I can function enough to finish off my chores and get my meals prepped for the week. 

Monday comes around and I start the process again... with caution. 

Sorry if that was long and dragged out.
TLDR; symptoms are manageable at the beginning of the week, full blown episode at the end of the week. 

I ad really like to get your thoughts. And also, thank you for never giving up on yourselves and others.

"Getting worse again Hello. 

So I was doing relatively OK in January but since then I feel like I'm slowly getting worse.  It finally got really bad this weekend.  Hallucinations are back. I started having some delusions (which I know don't make sense but they still feel real) and I have a feeling like I'm not really a person but rather a voice in my head and someone else is the real person. 

I have a test for an exam tomorrow and I don't know if im gonna do OK. Part from that it's the second time I've gotten worse while at university and last time I had to drop my classes to only take 1. This can't keep happening. 

I haven't called my Dr because it just feels like it won't do anything. He's not a bad doctor but what can he do. It's not like he can give me something to get better at once. Medicine too like why am I taking medicine if its just gonna keep getting worse.

It just feels so hopeless. If I'm just gonna be feeling like this the rest of my life what's the point of going through with it. It doesn't seem like I'll get better permanently. It doesn't seem like I'll ever graduate.

"Geodon For the most part, this drug has changed my life for the better. It's gotten rid of all of my most troublesome schizophrenic symptoms and I actually feel like a normal, functioning human being.

I still have my minor auditory and visual hallucinations, but I consider those to be hard-stuck so I'm okay with them.

So I'm on 120mg once a day and I take it with 1000 calories of food which is a hassle because it's taken away my appetite, but I don't consider that to be a bad thing.

The only bad part about taking this drug is the fact that near the 24hr mark of taking my regular dose, my paranoia and anxiety return and are almost worse than they have ever been, so I take a valium to offset those symptoms.

It goes like this: eat, take dose, sleep, wake up, feel amazing until it's almost time to take the next dose, pop valium, and repeat.

I am productive and happy during the time after I wake up and throughout the day.

I am making an appointment tomorrow to see if there is anything I can do about this but in the mean time, I'd like to know if anyone else has had/is having a similar experience?",Schizophernia

I've been talking to a guy on tinder and we've really hit it off and we're planning to have a date on Tuesday.

He sees a therapist I think but he doesn't take medication for it (apparently he doesn't like how he feels on it.) I don't have an issue with it and it doesn't turn me off from him. I don't think a mental illness should define a person and what does defines him is great. I do really like him.

"[PROJECT] Lethe - An interactive story about psychotic disorders Hi there!  


I'm working on my college final year project. The idea is to create an interactive fiction story, in which the user is also the protagonist. I've always been so interested in how people with psychotic disorders perceive the world, and I thought this might be an opportunity to show people what it can be like living with hallucinations and delusions. I want people to empathize and get to know mental illness, rather than staying in ignorance, making assumptions and feeding the stigma.  


I've made my research in fiction, and very often people with schizophrenia are portrayed as crazy, brutal, violent, insensitive and dehumanized beings. On the other hand, I stumbled across Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice (a videogame which I believe treats mental illness in the right way) and I was fascinated. I want to get close to that game's vibe.  


So I'm about to begin writing the actual story, and build the fictional world's imaginary, and wanted to ask people that suffer delusions and hallucinations your experience. My idea is to try to depict all of these experiences through video and audio, to create a compelling and ""real"" atmosphere around the text that the user will be reading. I hope I have explained myself clear enough. Any comment or suggestion would also be much appreciated! I'll leave some questions that might help:  


What do you hear? Are voices clear or distorted? What do you see? Are your visions kind of blurry or defined? What triggers your hallucinations? What delusions do you have? What is your perception of the world?   


Thank you very much!",Schizophernia
"""What lead to Psychosis"": Kinda Long For me, it has been hard going back to normalcy after experiencing the other side. I have always believed that I am an intelligent person (like many of us are) who unfortunately lacks motivation in many daily mundane activities. As a result, I have developed an[ impostor syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) that has been hard to shake until I am experiencing another psychosis. I have never really told anyone what my experiences are like, not even to my therapist as I feel they will hear it but not be able to understand it. This post is more of what happened before a major break from reality.

When I am under psychosis, I feel connected to nature and all life experiences around me. Life transitions from being a TV show that I am watching to one that I am actively participating in. I begin to have enormous amounts of energy and work out to a point where I get in shape almost night and day (lost 20 lbs in two weeks).

My brain starts to click and I see connections that others don't notice or can imagine and I initially become ""uber objective"" in the way I conceptualize my environment. If the connection is absurd to others, I will find credible theories via Wikipedia and go down a rabbit hole of information and begin a new journey of understanding. I become an addict to information and need a fix as much as I can and begin to seek topics that I am not or have not been interested in the past.

Once I have reached my capacity of knowledge for the ""day"", I'll meditate in a dark room and process all the information and try to seek meaning and connection from it and apply it to predicting how events will unfold.

In this meditative state, I become ever increasingly objective, which results in widely accepted aspects of life become irrelevant such as the 24hr time period. I realize its usefulness; however, conclude, it has no intrinsic value to the grand scheme of the universe. Time as we know it only has any value on this earth.

I begin to think of the universe beyond what I have experienced, and in my mind, I attempt to visualize how the universe began and see it through the pitch black that have enveloped me. Sometimes I see it and sometimes I don't.

My meditative state is usually broken when I cannot imagine a concept as a result of lack of new informational nourishment. At this point it usually hits me, ""How long have I been here in this dark room. What have I missed and what am I missing."" I will start to feel alone and feel like as spec in the cosmos that has no knowledge or care for my existence.

""The anxiety, the shallow breathing, the adrenaline, it all overwhelms me. I feel something in my chest. A rhythm a beat. I snap out of it and have to get out of the darkness before it consumes me. Before I fall into the void. I am not an objective machine.""

""There has to be a purpose. I have to have a purpose.""

As an aside, there has been two common themes throughout my delusions my view of the other side. These themes are two people. The situation has always been strange for me as I genuinely care for them even though I really don't know them. Hearing these people during my episodes confuses me, motivates me, and ironically relaxes me. Whenever I am not going through an episode I will try my hardest to ignore them and not look to see what they are currently working on. I have never done anything that would affect them in anyway, at least I hope, it is more of knowing how I felt so connected to them when I created a reality where they were involved in were at the center of it.

With that said, a few months before my last big break from reality, when I was doing okay, but in retrospect was really slowly sinking, I looked on her Instagram. She looked as beautiful as ever. I could sense a sadness though. I felt as if something was wrong and thought I couldn't be the only one who is noticing this. Since it was the first time I had looked in what seemed like years, I tried to find out. I did some simple googling/searching and concluded there was nothing wrong and nothing to support that there was. I felt alone and got wasted. For a month that continued, and I really don't remember much during that time period. I still had the feeling that something was wrong and the spiral continued.

I did have something wrong with me, besides what is related to this sub, and more of less focused on that. In the past two years I had gained 40lbs, extremely passive, and apathetic. Life was miserable for me. One medication I was taking made what ever went into my stomach feel like acid and come out like acid. And even after 6 months of transitioning away from that medication that side effect didn't go away.

My thought process at the time began to focus on the mentality of ""If I'm going to feel miserable no matter what I do, I might as well be in control of the misery."" Thus I was drinking almost out of control. I was only in control enough to barely make it through work a day and continue the process of living in hell.

In a drunken stupor, I looked on her Instagram and my worst fears became reality. There was in fact something wrong. She had a disease analogous to what I had. My heart sunk. My world faded in. I felt a genuine emotion for the first time in such a long time and it happened to be one that I never want to ever feel again.

I felt powerless and felt so disgusted that I was complaining of what I had when she was dying and almost died. Seeing and knowing that the photo that she posted could have been her death bed.. I finally woke up to a new reality.

I stopped drinking and tried to do it cold turkey (I know its stupid). As I am sure many of you have experience, besides the physical agony of going through withdrawal, it was the mental aspect that really got me. I was having constant nightmares and hearing voices... again.

Somehow, I made it through this phase and ended up feeling better with more energy (probably hypo-manic). It did feel like no matter how good I was doing and how I was starting to get my life together.. it always ended up with a bit of sadness. I knew that at any moment one of the shining lights in my life (at a distance) could be gone at any moment and I was doing nothing to make it better for her.

I again lost hope and posted something on a twitter account that I had created with no followers or friends, which accurately represented how I felt about life at the moment. There were people in real life that I would regularly hang out with but never fully divulged what I have been through in the past as a fear of being misunderstood and stigmatized... They probably would have understood.. but I guess that is neither here nor there.

What I had posted was something like this ""I hope we appreciate and love ""her"" this time around before it is too late. ""She"" has the exact name to someone that passed away that I had always felt no on fully appreciated her till she was gone. ""I just want her to be loved.""

Fast forward, a month, and I began to focus on my personal health issues again. I went from taking a medication (unrelated to this sub) that went from twice a day (the one that fucked up my insides), to one that was once a month, to the new one I am on that is every six months. The new one that I am on is nice since I frequently would forget about the underlying issue that I had and why I was taking it for.

On the flip side, all the pressure and knowing every six months everything has to go right for me to get the infusion really got to me a week before. I stopped showing up to work and was having severe anxiety issues. When I finally got the hours long infusion, I began to reflect on how she must have felt when she was going under for her surgery and the shear fear the must of overwhelmed her.

I had decided from that moment that I was going to take it all serious and since I knew that I could not go to work for a while that I was going to stop taking all the medication that at the time I viewed was holding me back mentally (was not a good idea in how I did it and don't condone it. It is just how it happened).

I was taking a few medications for my mental well-being. The medication that I did not realize would send me into another break from reality was the steroids that were used in my infusion. It crazy how it is always the lack of sleep that compels me into another reality.

So from earlier, after my infusion, I had went through that process of becoming super rationale to realizing that it was not solely for me. What followed , no matter if I want to admit it or not, was probably the most interesting parts of my life.

To this day it is hard to talk about what actually happened during this episode. Mostly because a lot of it actually happened, parts of it were hallucinations, and some of it I don't actually know.

I'll probably post what happened later sometime. It just feels good to open up a little bit even if though this will probably go to the birds. ",Schizophernia

"In need of advice I hope this is okay, but I need some advice.  My brother in law is going through something, and after hours of research I think he may be schizophrenic.  A few things that have happened are:

-Put on administrative leave at his job after saying he feared he would be shot there (this happened in October, so it as been about 6 months now)

-Thinks he is going to be the president 

-Accuses my sister of being a coke snorting, gay prostitute and invents scenarios in his head with her past coworkers or friends 

-Thinks there are cameras in their house 

-Tells everyone who tries to reason with him that they are sell outs 

-Told my parents to watch out for my sister because she may be suicidal now that she is being exposed and tried to convince my mom to meet him alone in a parking lot with their daughter without telling my sister 

I am probably forgetting stuff.  My sister left in the middle of the night with my niece about 7 weeks ago, and is on leave from her job and pregnant, but her husband refuses to seek help because it as all going to come out that he was right.

I know I could be reading too much into all of this, but I do know there is something wrong with him, and he needs help.  My sister called the police twice on him after she left, but they said he seemed okay, although now I understand that they would probably not do much since she was in another state when she called.  

I don at know what I am expecting with this post, tbh.  I know that no one is a doctor here, but if you have anything to say I greatly appreciate it.  I am afraid he won at be able to come back because he is letting it go on too long.

"I had the worst day at work yesterday and need to vent. So I am a waiter at a restaurant and worked last night. When I woke up that day I knew it was going to be a bad day. I recently added a new anti psychotic to my meds and have been feeling strange since I started it. I figure it takes a few weeks for my body to adjust to the new medication. Anyways about an hour before work I started having visual hallucinations and felt depersonalized. It was awful but it was too late to call in sick to work so I go anyways. I proceeded to have the absolute worst day. I was hallucinating constantly at work and hearing people scream my name. It was very busy at work and I was super stressed out but had to keep calm. I fucked up one of the tables and forgot to put someones drink order in. The table then berated me for forgetting and told me I need to write stuff down. Well I do write stuff down but I was having trouble concentrating. So i get this guy his drink and say sorry and the lady says ""If you're sorry then you need to comp this drink"". I'm like ok sorry and comp the drink but they were nasty to me for the rest of the time they were there they tipped me 5%. It was just awful, I was already on the edge of a panic attack the whole time and seriously considered just leaving mid shift because I could barely deal with my tables. I didn't though and finished my shift with 1.1k in sales. It just sucks when you have to work while you are hallucinating. Like its fucking scary and the job is really stressful already. I don't know it just sucks and I wish people would be more understanding when their waiter messes up. Like I'm human too and I make mistakes. I'm feeling much better today and have the day off, but I know that I'm going to have to work and eventually I'll have another day like this. It stresses me out so much.",Schizophernia

"Well I unsuccessfully tried to have my girlfriend committed. She had been hurting herself and was threatening me over my thoughts she was hearing because her telepathy. She said she has sneeze tourettes which usually comes out as fuck my life. Today it change to I all fucking kill you. She thinks I been fucking my dog and I found marks on him today like she as been hurting him. I recorded some of her ramblings for proof to try to get a hold. She as been up for like 72 hours, she said she is sleeping but I think it was a lie.

She was rambling how the neighbors are watching her, friends in the FBI who been tracking what I am doing, how her friend in FBI gave her a murder pass. Her New Years Resolution is not to murder anyone but she doesn at think she can follow through with it, a friend of her supposedly wants to murder someone with her.

Called the hospital I stayed at for my attempted suicide. They told me to call 911. She calls her dad when the cops are here. Play the recorded of her talking about punching herself repeatedly in the abdomen to miscarry (she wasn at pregnant according to any test but always thinks she is) and her talking about murdering people. The dad tells them he is taking her to a hospital out of state and they let her go so that plan failed to get her help. She is on no meds at all and progressively getting worse and worse with delusions of demons trying to tell her to kill people but also some angels have been helping her out. 

I wish her the best, I doubt her family takes her to get her help though. They kind of suck and enable her. I still worry, she left me like two weeks ago for not even 24 hours and told me she almost kills some guy because he was going to kidnap her and put her in the sex trade in California. Luckily she got picked up by her dad, her sister was there and didn at hear them talking about the sex trade thing. I am afraid she is going to get in legal trouble for hurting or killing someone or hurt herself. Sucks it is out of my hands now.",Schizophernia

"Activities With Your Hallucinations? Hi, all. I got really curious about this, and wanted to ask as many sources as possible. 

Do you do activities with your hallucinations, if they aren't malicious? (I just plain don't acknowledge negative voices.)

For example, I have 5 main voices that are typically pretty chill. If they get bored, they argue, so I prevent that by painting with them, making collages, etc. 

I ask them to pick between activities. Typically they pick finger painting, as they can tell me what they want on paper and it doesn't have to look good.

Is this a healthy or unhealthy way of dealing with them? My last therapist thought this was a good idea, as long as I didn't get carried away, but I'd like some input from outside sources regardless

Note: I'm on meds, they just aren't helping very much. Trying to find some good ones.",Schizophernia
"Communicating with parent who has schizophrenia Some background: My mom was diagnosed with schizophrenia seven years ago. She had been showing symptoms for quite a few years before that. She also was a meth addict (along with other drugs) for quite a while until the symptoms started. She eventually quit, and then the symptoms got much worse. She then got court ordered to go to a mental facility where she got diagnosed. For a court order, there had to be proof that she was endangering herself and/or others (sad). Once she was out and on medication, you couldn at even tell she had schizophrenia. She and I had the best relationship we ave ever had. Of course, that came to an end once she stopped taking her meds. Now she as back where she started (and possibly using again). On top of that, her dad died. This lead to much worse symptoms. She inherited some money and his house, but she only gets $400/month through disability. She as definitely in no condition to work right now. She can at afford any of her bills with this small amount monthly. I would help, but I am a broke college student struggling to pay my own rent. 

She as currently living by herself in an old farmhouse with no water, gas, or electricity. She as also way behind on her taxes so she as likely to lose her house at any given moment. 

Me and all of my family members have tried various approaches to talk to her. She won at listen to us though. I really just want to find a way to get through to her. She also holds a grudge against my uncles because they were the ones that got the court order. I KNOW the meds were working because she was so happy, conversational, and not showing even the slightest symptom.

She as also in denial that she even has schizophrenia. 

Any advice from people who suffer from schizophrenia or have experience with it would be appreciated. I just wish I could talk to her. I want my mom back. I know there isn't much I can actively do. But if anyone can help me find a way to communicate with her would be super helpful.",Schizophernia

"Regarding diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia, what constitutes ""two voices conversing with each other""? I regularly experience auditory hallucinations, often consisting of what I call ""radio chatter"". It usually manifests as what sounds like a radio playing in another room. Sometimes it's music, sometimes it's the ""hosts"" commenting on news or the music. It's rarely distinct enough to distinguish exactly what's being said or what song is playing... just barely clear enough to make out that it's a radio... and it often seems as though it's an old timey radio show, like something from the 1940s.

These arent my only hallucinations, nor are they my only symptoms. I'm just curious as to whether are not this symptom, on its own, is sufficient to classify as a significant Criterion A symptom. Have any of you experienced similar symptoms, or had experience with similar symptoms in others (patients, friends, family, etc.)?

Included with occasional, mild visual and tactile hallucinations, social withdrawl, and long-term employment impact, would this still warrant a schizophrenia diagnosis despite not having a ""running commentary?

"How to Help I would like to know what is the best way to help someone with a mental disorder. 

I believe my nephew, 15 years old, may be schizophrenic. He has not been diagnosed. We have been waiting for a year to find out if he has Autism or something else. He has incredible difficulties learning, communicating, understanding basic concepts, understanding basic human interactions and expressions. He is also extremely lazy and his parents do not help him. He plays games and is on his phone all the time. 

Last year, he had a breakdown and was taken to a children as mental hospital for two nights. It was the most heartbreaking thing I have experienced. He was suicidal and was hearing things. He seems to be having another episode. Last weekend, he said he felt something in his heart like he wanted to hurt someone. I took him outside and told him to breathe and try to calm his thoughts and brought his notebook for him and told him to draw the sunset. That seemed to help him. 

Yesterday, he was texting me asking weird questions (what is an alpha, beta, omega; what as a wolf pack; what as a black sheep and white sheep) and last night he was pretty worked up. He was saying things that didn at make sense at all that he was trying to understand them but he can at say who them is. And a lot of other things that don at make sense. I spoke to him pretty sternly and told him that he needed to sleep so he could think better in the morning. I said when he doesn at get sleep, he doesn at think clearly. To stop worrying and go to sleep and tomorrow will be another day and he should wake up and try to make it a good one. 

In the past, I ave told him to try to think whether the stuff he is thinking makes sense or not. And if it doesn at make sense, he should stop worrying about it. But the thing is that I don at know what makes sense to him because of the way his brain works. I don at know if saying what you are thinking is not correct. Think of it this way helps him or not. I just read on another thread that someone was upset because their family goes along with their delusions. So is correcting him good?

Also, he had a doctor visit today and she said he was having a paranoia episode. 

Also, it is so hard to try to help him. I feel awful and I don at know if I can. He is not on meds. He was last year but it was terrible, he was a zombie and had drooling and other bad side effects. They changed the meds a few times and overall, it was the same, no improvement. In fact, when he was on some meds, he had several panic attacks (he constantly worries that he doesn at know the future and can at see it anymore; also he worries about dreams he has).",Schizophernia

"I visited my best friend (who has Schizophrenia) at a psych ward and she said really hurtful/mean things to me. What do I do when she gets out/returns to normal? I (23yo female) have been best friends with a girl (24yo female) for the last 10+ years. In the past few years it almost feels like I ave kind of taken on the role as her secondary caretaker (after her parents of course). We spend a lot of time together and I help her with regular adulting things (e.g., I taught her how to drive, helped her start classes at comm. college, apply for jobs, budgeting, basic computer skills, etc.), but also fun stuff like dating, exercising, etc. She had her first manic episode (and psych ward visit) at 18yo and they diagnosed her with bipolar disorder. Last year, she went to a new psychiatrist and they also diagnosed her with Schizophrenia based on her symptoms (which seems more accurate since she was adopted from Russia as a baby and her birth mom had Schizophrenia). She has random periods where she goes on/off her meds, and we can usually tell, but it just got really bad the past few weeks after she dropped her classes and wasn't working/doing anything, but being alone with her thoughts. 

Two weeks ago, she ended up back in the psych ward for the first time in 7 years and after a week of being there and being off her meds, I decided to visit her, along with her other friend. I never visited her the first time she was there, so I only heard some things about it through her mom, and she did warn me it could be bad. 

It was the worst experience of my life. I sat down with her and she flipped me off immediately and ignored me. However, she smiled/laughed at her other friend visiting, so that was strange. When I tried to talk to her, she would turn her head towards me slowly and stare creepily into my eyes for several minutes before breaking the glance and turning back to her other friend. She looked like she wanted to hurt/kill me, so I was getting scared and so was her other friend. Her lip would shake a little, but she just had this flat stare/expression and wouldn at blink or say anything. I was absolutely horrified. Then she told me she hated me and that she never knew me. She told me to get the hell out, so I left and called her parents. My heart was literally broken! I was crying and very shaken up, I still am. It was so scary to see her like that and for her to say those things to me.

When she gets out and back on her medication, what do I do?  Do I just forget what she said to me and pretend it didn at happen? Is that fair to myself or to her (to not know the truth)? Also, I am kind of scared to be alone with her now. Seeing how she was off her meds and how she quickly turned on me, frightened me. How do I know she won at act like this again the next time she randomly decides to go off her meds? I really don at know what to do or how to react when she gets out.
