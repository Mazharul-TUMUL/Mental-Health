"This may sound off topic but I'm really scared by how technology 3d graphics are more and more realistic, thinking in how in the future, violent games will be extremely realistic makes me extremely anxious.",Anxiety
"I have to say Im a big fan of Mortal kombat, obviously I don't have a problem with violence in games but games being more and more realistic really scares me.",Anxiety
Darn you anxiety. I know it?s just a thought but I hate how my brain tries to convince me I?m always on the brink of death.,Anxiety
Does anyone else ask them self's this question when they are feeling great and anxiety free then all of a sudden BAM anxiety and fear swoops in and ruins your day !!,Anxiety
I could be playing with my 4 year old son and that voice in my head will just be nagging at me..,Anxiety
"My partner could go to me whilst sitting on the sofa... babe do you want to meet up with such and such this weekend for some food....... then I ask myself ""But what if i get anxiety when I'm there and it zaps me of my energy and I can't enjoy myself and I might freak out""",Anxiety
Whats everyone's thoughts on this and have you managed you shift your thoughts so it doesn't effect you??? Teach me !,Anxiety
This world/society often is a harsh place. It's not your fault if you're unable to cope with it. It's not your fault if you're more sensitive than others. Take time to rest and practice self care. You're not alone.,Anxiety
I'm starting a new job and today I had a 2 hour online orientation where a manager talked to me and the other new hires about the job.,Anxiety
"I've been wondering when my start date is, and at the end the manager said ""questions?"" Well ofc my social anxiety had me book it out of there and I left the call. But then I realized I really shoulda asked my start date because I'm anxiously waiting about that, afraid I won't get an email about it and miss my start date and get fired before I ever even start work. I know that's ridiculous, this place has a bunch of employees and they all started the job just fine.",Anxiety
"I can't stop hating myself for not asking the question though. It would've been so simple and I would have known the answer so I wouldn't have to sit here anxiously waiting for the mystery email not knowing when. Now I'm regretting not trading the social anxiety for this long term waiting anxiety. I can't relax at all. I can't get it out of my brain, both the anxiety about waiting/not knowing/missing my start date as well as the hate I have for myself for not asking the question. I don't know if I'll actually be able to sleep tonight because of it, I'm going to check my email first thing in the morning. I know that I'll check it when I check it and the anxiety won't change that, but it'll keep me up like that'll change something regardless.I feel like I'm being eaten alive from the inside.",Anxiety
I feel like I'm being eaten alive from the inside.I have really negative thoughts about not making money.Its caused me to save about 100K over 4 years. Weekend work and over time. And I am now in corporate business to business sales and I feel burnt out from the targets and feel I cannot do the job.,Anxiety
"I didnt start earning proper income until 25. Before that I was university, travelling 1 hour back and fourth each way and then visiting the doctors clinic 3 times a week for my medical treatments. I was not able to earn much apart from the holiday casual jobs. I dont know why but I feel worn out from all the time spent studying, traveling to campud and doctors clinics and not being able to work. To the point where I ended up working a shit tonne to save because I felt like I had to make up for lost time. And now I am in a career I dont like. Too mucj pressure and targets and I resigned on Monday.",Anxiety
"So im postponing to start new work. Im so scared. I was working in one company about a year and they suspended me cause i didnt want to do something which is against my will. So I moved back to my city took some break and want to go back to dancing/stripping job (which I was doing before)  but then I realised I'm kinda traumatised if i can call it this way and im terrified to go there. Honestly I dont know what happened. Through many years Ive been a stripper and changed clubs never had that problem. Ofc I was nervous but not to that point that I cant make decisions and Im completely paralysed. That corporation work gave me anxiety, panic attacks etc. I was working overtime, they were pushing me hard and I also was agreeing with that. Isnt that crazy, that working in stripclub was more healthu for me than office job?! Now I regret that bdcause im so devastated. I have no idea how im going to live if im so afraid to go work. Im. Just postponing telling myself next week, next week...",Anxiety
"I took an exam and I'm having really bad anxiety over how I did. I'm panicking as I know that is worth a lot of points and I know I got a lot of questions wrong.  I can't stop thinking about it and it's preventing me from moving on with my other assignments. Once I know the grade, I can plan for the next assignments. Thus, do you think I should send an email?",Anxiety
"I seem to get anxiety when it's almost time for work, almost time for lunch break, almost time to leave work, when I first step in the stores and when it's time to check out, and sometimes talking too much.",Anxiety
"I have no reason why but I just get these weird feelings that come and go. I get hot and a bit dizzy, heart racing and sweaty hands and just want to quickly get my tasks done and rush home.",Anxiety
It started a long time ago when I went shopping for a car battery and couldn't even pay because I was having a anxiety attack. One time I went with my brother in law to ToysRUs when we waited in line for a Nintendo Switch. Waited outside for a while and when we finally got in and I was paying I got anxiety.,Anxiety
I also get anxiety and light headed after talking too much when really into a conversation.,Anxiety
It's weird because I don't have any social anxiety or fear of shopping. I'm a very talkative and outgoing person but I get these weird anxiety moments out the blue that i learned to avoid now as it comes and goes quickly.,Anxiety
"I was given GERD meds, anxiety meds, lower anxiety meds, blood work and ecg test all normal. I quit my meds a while ago but I'm thinking when I got covid in Nov it just made my anxiety come back. I went from the past couple years to cigarettes, to hookah, to vape and I couldn't even vape after covid I nearly passed out while driving. I quit vaping but that's when my anxiety started.",Anxiety
"Hi guys. Would it still be possible for me to get a drivers license if I was diagnosed with GAD and Insomnia? My country states that people diagnosed with mental disorders may not be allowed licenses and I am not sure how to go about it, as I have already taken driving lessons and I do not experience any anxiety on the road. I would appreciate any advice. Thank you in advance.",Anxiety
"Hi, I'm sorry if it doesn't fit here but I'm really anxious rn. So I knew that I have a dentist appointment this month just didn't know when. Also I wanted to cancel it because I'm ill. And few minutes ago I realized I wrote the appointment date in my notes and I found out it was supposed to be yesterday. What should I do? I'm really scared to tell someone because they will be mad and the dentist will be mad for sure.",Anxiety
"Im diagnosed with anxiety disorder and ptsd from things i barely even know happened or if I'm just seeking validation. Probably a mix. I'm just tired of feeling my heartbeat from my stomach up to my neck 24/7. It's fucking exhausting and annoying. Always trying to combat it with drugs, alcohol or a healthier alternative: running and lifting weights. Nothing works in the long run. I don't want to die but I feel like I'm not capable of putting up with this much longer. I think about suicide every day. I could live with panic-attacks and depression but this? No one can live like this. I can't at least. I've done so many check ups. Nothing is wrong. It's apparently just a constant pound of anxiety and adrenaline. Fuck this fucking shit with a brick.",Anxiety
I?ve had anxiety/depression since I was 14 or younger. And I?m looking to go on disability for myself. I?ve lost over 10 jobs because of my panic attacks and I?m at the end of my rope. I?m tired of failing. I?m 29 years old and I can?t even hold onto a simple job. I heard it?s really hard to get on disability but I?m willing to try. I also live in California.,Anxiety

"Hey! How you guys exercise with anxiety and panic attacks? I am afraid to do it because during exercise my heart rate is up and etc. Today I did low impact aerobic for 30 minutes and got dizzy anxiety and etc. Any tips? I did running for a few years but stopped 5 years ago because got panic attack during one run.It feels like this can?t be anxiety. I?m so detached and not with it, that I feel completely numb and not real. But on the other hand my limbs always feel really weird and I feel like I have so much internal pain that I obviously am real. Panic attacks make me feel like I?m dying even though I already feel dead. I hope this makes sense to someone.be in a nice cottage close to forest and unlimited food supply, watching tv shows and movies and be in bed until I start feeling better and try to develop healthy habits and make well thought plan while being in a calm surroundings when nothing neither no one will cause my anxiety or panic attack. I think I would need at least three months to recover. I want to stop feel anxious, I want to be like I was before. But it's just not possible with overwhelming environment that is my life. I need calmness, silence, space, nature. I want to learn to love myself and my life but I can't do that when I feel really unwell every day. Then I would get back and no one would know and wouldn't ask any questions and I would have space and wouldn't be scared to get help. I know it's more daydreaming than venting. However, that's the only good thing that I have left, because everything is dull or scary and I am tired to ""live"" on the sparks of happy moments that rarely last longer than few hours until my anxiety or depressive thoughts ruin them.",Anxiety
I?ve had a lot of stress recently and the last day or so have been feeling feverish (no other symptoms) however when I have checked my temperature it is normal.,Anxiety
"Hello everyone, I was wondering if anyone has any experience with alcohol triggering their anxiety, but not while drinking but a day or two later. I stopped drinking about 6 months ago for a good reason, I was never drinking in moderation and it became an everyday thing that I lost control over. I noticed my depression and anxiety were out of control while drinking like that(i was drinking heavily for a few years to be honest), and considered the alcohol to be playing a huge role in that.On Sunday however I decided to have some wine and champagne for a Valentine?s Day, and I got a nice buzz. Spent all of Monday in bed and hung over, with a little anxiety creeping in but nothing too bad. Today however I had two full blown anxiety attacks, that seemingly came out of nowhere, completely unsure of any trigger.",Anxiety
"I was wondering if this could potentially be from drinking? Or maybe my anxiety is just on one today. Thank you for any input in advance. ?? Also if anyone has anything that works for them to help soothe and calm them down, please feel free to share!",Anxiety
"I had an intense panic attack last night. I woke up suddenly because my cat was fighting with another cat and I started getting hot flashes, trembling and a racing heart beat, I thought I was dying or something. When I recognize that it was a panic attack (because at first I thought I was having a bad reaction to the paroxetine I'm taking and I was literally dying, i lived bitch lol) I calmed down and felt back to sleep. But then I woke up again because I needed to feed my cat and I felt the same again but less panicky because I knew I was safe. But now during the day I've been getting random hot flashes, I don't panic but it's annoying. Does anyone have tips on how to make them go away or make myself more comfortable?  I feel like every time I start to think about the future I get anxious and get one ?? I try to distract myself but I can't help it.",Anxiety
"I?m in 11th grade (16 years old), and I have been focused on going to a certain college since freshman year. I used to have good grades, and ever since zoom days, my grades are averaging B?s and C?s, my willingness to work is only decreasing, and so is my will to live. I?m terrified of the future, of growing up. I feel like I?m only going to be a failure. I can?t be what my parents want me to be, I?m not smart enough to please them. The idea of going to college and being independent is killing me. I worry about my future all the time. I don?t know what to do or how to fix my anxieties. I just want to die.",Anxiety
"It?s happening again. I?ve got a new task at work and I have no idea how to do it. Usually I get anxious and think ?how am I going to get through this?? But this time I actually feel defeated. I actually feel myself have given up and I don?t know what to do. I?m sitting here, wanting to cry. I can see it when I look in the mirror, I look so drowned by work that it hurts my heart. It wouldn?t make me feel so bad if I had some help to go to with my questions but really it feels like I?m being left to drown. I really really want to go home, crawl in bed, and not have to deal with the world for a couple weeks. I?m genuinely scared of what?s going to happen when my manager checks how my assignment is coming along and I?ll be struggling to show them any ounce of progress. I feel like a failure, I got an engineering degree just to come work and realize I suck at it. I?m so scared that I won?t get better at it and then I don?t know what I?ll do.",Anxiety
I need to get my homework done but I keep getting overwhelmed and I should have done it in class but I had a huge panic attack and couldn?t do anything and my friend calmed me down but I?m getting overwhelmed again and fuck I hate the way my brain works,Anxiety
So I have this friend but sometimes I question whether he's a real friend but am not sure if it's just my anxiety that is making overthink things. At first he was always trying to include me in his friend group but since I always deal with anxiety I had a hard time opening up to him but he was always patient with trying not to push me to talk. Which slowly I started feeling more comfortable with talking to him and we did ended talking with each other a lot more. I even told him the reason why I wouldn't talk so much when we would all hangout as a group which he told me that he never expected me to ever force myself to talk which made me so happy to hear that he understood what I was dealing with. Sadly lots of the times we all hangout as a group it felt that he always had something to talk about with the rest of the group and little with me and I never understood why when I talked to him about my hobbies and things I enjoyed with him. So I didn't get why it felt as if it was so hard for him to have something to talk to me about. I don't know I feel my anxiety just making it very hard for me to have a friendship with him to the point that I question whether he is my real friend or that he just keeps me around because he feels bad for me. I also feel that I have to face the reality that because I didn't talk most the time that people will not feel comfortable talking to me because I can be very quiet. Which I can understand because I don't really feel comfortable talking to the group but I don't understand my friend doing it to me.,Anxiety
"Basically just being poor in America and in between jobs. I suffer from anxiety and occasionally panic attacks. Although I don't know if it arises to the point of GAD, it's definitely impacting my life.My living situation and my life only compounds my anxiety. I'm in my early 30s and I'm poor, no job atm (and when I was employed, I always hated the jobs I had), I haven't had a real irl friend for over a decade, never dated and don't have a gf, living with family, had to turn in my lease (car) because I'm poor, I'm introverted and a bit of homebody, etc.",Anxiety
"She told me she wasnt able to come with me tomorrow because shes babysitting and there is literally no one else who can take my little cousin tomorrow. I've asked all the people I trust and they all have work/other commitments. The only person who is free is my gran, who I havent even asked as she is very one sided and believes my fear is ""overdramatic"" and would actively make me worse if I brought her along.ll the resources I've found online are just ""dont look at the needle!"", but just knowing there is one actively coming towards me triggers my flight or fight so bad I wont let anyone even touch me without lashing out at them, making me a danger to the nurse and myself.",Anxiety

"Hi there, i tested positive last Monday before I was supposed to have my first day at a new job in the office. I wasn?t that sick on Monday so I started remotely but yesterday and today I am feeling really bad, so I called in sick. They are understanding, but I do feel guilty because it?s such a bad start. Did anyone experience something like this?",Anxiety
Anybody who has taken Prozac for anxiety - did you get any bad side effects? And how likely are bad side effects? I've been prescribed Prozac but I'm very nervous about the potential side effects it can cause. I don't know if I'm ready for antidepressants but my doctor did prescribe them to me so... I don't know. My anxiety is making me not want to take the thing that might help me.,Anxiety
Can anyone help me out? I used to be prescribed Propranolol and sertraline (predominately for depression). But once I aged out of my parent's insurance I basically just stopped taking.,Anxiety
I know things like GoodRx exist now and the prices really arn't that bad. but I still don't know how to go about getting written prescription. I also want to consider other medication because I'm not sure sertraline was actually helping my long-term anxiety. Is this something I can do online? I no longer live near my old doctor and really really don't want to pay $100+ for 15 min with a doctor.,Anxiety
Would also appreciate any suggestions on medication for both social and general anxiety.,Anxiety
Anyone else experience this I know I?m not my thoughts but she was being condescending I think and I had intrusive thoughts of violence but to be fair we aren?t our thoughts but still upsetting,Anxiety
"I've been trying to get into dental school for close to 3 years now (I've been rejected multiple times) For thr first time ever I made it to the interview stage and well I was expecting to have a panic attack and cry as soon as it started and it was one of the things I dreaded the most about the process, I was actually proud of myself for actually making it through and being able to actually speak and say things(not exactly the right things), I could tell I wasn't saying the things I wanted to say but I kept going. The hardest part is that I am so passionate about dentistry and I've put in so much time and effort into it and each time I get told you're not good enough. Its so hard to be seen the way you want to be seen but I guess I wasn't able to get that across. I've been told by people that I don't deserve to be one and today I actually believe it. I got my interview rejection and I've spent most of the day crying  just noticed this went way of topic I'm sorry",Anxiety
"I've battled with crippling anxiety and depression these past few years and it hasn't made any of this easy, I have a really awful home life which is another problem in itself. One of the reasons I got into dentistry was because I used to suffer from dental anxiety and wanted to be able to help people with similar problems but maybe I'm not the person for the job but I would still like to know for those who suffer with the same problem what kind of dentist would you want to treat you?",Anxiety
"My anxiety had gotten so out of control in the last two years. I cannot find a therapist that works for me, can?t quite figure out the point as it just feels like I?m paying someone to vent to for an hour with no real direction ever provided. I can never justify paying for that when I have friends and family that?ll listen to me for free.",Anxiety
"I know meds would likely really benefit me but I?m currently breastfeeding and just can?t bring myself to do it until I?m done (looking to wean at the 2yr mark end of May) so I?m so close to being done.But even then, knowing the meds are likely going to help my anxiety, I?m SO anxious about even starting them and experiencing side effects.",Anxiety
"How do I get over myself and the anxiety of worrying about side effects so I can just feel a bit more normal?

"Had my first job opportunity in a year. I was nervous for the interview, but that's to be expected. Everything about the day was going smoothly. I was anxious and jittery and really dreading it, but I was pushing through and prepared to get it done. I arrive at the place, I go inside and everything is closed down for the day. I know the time, date, and location were absolutely correct. I wait for a few minutes before the panic sets in and I feel like I'm about to break down. All that stress and anxiety and preparation building up to this. I hurry back to my car and just sit there. I'm in full freeze mode, I'm upset, I'm angry, I don't know what I'm going to do next but all I want is time to stop and everything to stop. I know the interviews a bust at this point, I'm too frazzled and upset and I just want to get out of this situation.",Anxiety
"Now I have to deal with the next steps. Calling the interviewer back, setting up a new date, dealing with the fucking embarrassment and shame of it all. I'm just irrated and angry that it has to be this difficult, that things couldn't just go smoothly. I'm just dreading everything and I hate it because I don't have any coping skills for this and I never have. That's always how it is with me. I'm good until a hiccup and I have to change course and things aren't smooth and simple anymore. It makes me feel really depressed because I'm finally on a medication that I think works, but I guess only to help my day to day level of anxiety. It can't give me coping skills to deal with this. I wish I was still in therapy but I can't do teletherapy so it's not really possible at the moment. Anyways. Thanks for listening to me rant. It's been a shitty day.",Anxiety
For those of you that live in cold climates and go to gym to help with anxiety. If you can't make the gym for a week because you hurt yourself or your on vacation.

"Once again I am coming to this sub. Thanks for always being there <3 So my anxiety developed alongside with a lot of stress at work. After not working for three month now and being in therapy I am finally starting to feel better. I didn?t even have a panic attack this month and the first symptomless week I?m about two years? until today. Tonight I met with my dad for a few beers and we had so,e fun. The pub we went to was a very traditional one for my area. My dad doesn?t live in my hometown anymore but he was in a nearby city to visit. The town I live in is one of the biggest in Germany yet everyone knows everyone. So we met these guys at the pub who knew a lot of people from my childhood that I despise. After we left the pub I walked my dad to the station so he could catch his train back to the hotel. While I was buying a ticket for him he went to the bathroom. He didn?t come back so I decided to wait for him in front of the restroom. All of a sudden a lady nearly ran into me. This could only be avoided as I jumped out of her way. When I approached her she went back to where she came from. A few seconds later a guy left the restroom. The lady shouted something at him and seemed scared. She then approached another guy waiting in front of the entrance and they talked about something. But I didn?t pay attention and looked at my phone. Another few seconds later the lady ran towards me again and asked me if I was a private inspector working with that other guy whom she had talked to before. This moment I realised that she was highly psychotic and went into ?work-mode? (I?m a social worker who used to work with mentally ill clients). So I talked to her until my dad came and I could walk him to the platform. Once I dropped him off I went home and had a panic attack.",Anxiety
Why am I even telling about that? Probably because I?m too anxious to call my therapist at 11pm and being kinda drunk. And I feel really ridiculous for having a panic attack about an encounter most people would just mark as strange and not think about it anymore. Ugh :(,Anxiety

I'm horrified.",Anxiety
"i know the obvious answer is something along the lines of ""well since it's going to happen no matter what, cherish them more and have more experiences with them"" but won't that make it hurt exponentially more when it inevitably happens, more experiences to grieve?I think I've struggled with this for a majority of my life, but now as I'm waning off of 60 mg of prozac I think that my health anxiety is getting worse and worse to the point that anything I feel I'm terrified of either having some rare disease or having cancer. I'm going to stay on 40 for now (up from the 20 I was on) but I have these feelings everyday in the afternoon that I'm sure could just be caffeine crashes, where my whole body kind of aches and I feel super anxious I'm going to pass out or end up in the hospital or have cancer.

"It seems like now at the age of 40, anxiety and depression are just constants. I used to be able to say ""This is a bout of depression."" Or ""This is a panic attack."" Over the years it has only gotten worse and I've been on all of the drugs that have existed up until now about it. Now I just live 100% of my life in the place where younger people are probably feeling they exist now.

My heart is beating so fast and I?m crying My anxiety has been really high all day and I feel like I'm constantly on the verge of a full blown panic attack. I can't focus or eat and I feel very shaky. My mind keeps going to worst case scenario...My dad is older and has a lot of health issues. Today he fell down, hurt his leg (which he's had clots in before), his arm, and his ribs. He can't take a proper breath and has been hurting for hours but refused to go to hospital until now. He took ALL of his meds and nothing helped, he couldn't even lift his arms. He has cancer, clots, and circulation issues among other things so I'm worried how bad a fall could be for him.",Anxiety
On top of all that our hospital has one of the WORST on call doctors ever. The doctor is the reason I have medical anxiety. There are so many local horror stories about this doctor and I'm so scared he'll see this doctor.,Anxiety
"I won't hear anything for hours probably, wait times are ridiculous here in ERs.I've never been officially diagnosed with anxiety, but my therapist thinks I have it.I started going to therapy for the first time a few months ago, because I was too stressed to eat or sleep. And it was interfering with my work, including affecting my productivity and memory.",Anxiety
"Therapy has been helping somewhat. But every two weeks or so, I spiral into an anxious mess and can barely function for several days in a row.",Anxiety
"The past two weeks have been the worst. I've been panicking about things that aren't important. And making rushed decisions out of fear, that come back to bite me. I ended up taking two days off as mental health days because I literally couldn't sleep and couldn't concentrate at work. The day after, I had an appointment with my therapist and she gave me some new techniques to try. And those help, but now I'm spiraling again and I don't know what to do.I scheduled an appointment with my primary care provider for Friday, to maybe try to get an official diagnosis or medication. But then I felt guilty that I've missed so much work lately (between mental health days and therapy sessions), so I canceled it.",Anxiety
"I don't know what to do. This is affecting my work and I'm scared that it's just going to continue getting more unmanageable. And I'm sure my supervisor or coworkers can guess that something is up. I know I'm acting weird. But I can't talk about it, for fear there will be stigma about it. So I'm stuck trying to function as best as I can, while pretending everything is fine.o, a little background on me. I started taking sertraline for anxiety about three months ago, after dealing with worsening anxiety for the past 10ish years. My doctor started me on 25 mg and I'm now at 50 mg. I absolutely feel better on this medication - I feel like I have more control over my anxiety and have the ability to stop myself before I get to a panic attack much more often lately. That doesn't mean it's completely gone, but it's certainly better.",Anxiety
"Which leads me to my question - how do you know when you are on the ""correct"" dosage of a drug for anxiety? Obviously, the ideal situation is the lowest dose that is effective. But how do I know when I've reached that point? I've had pretty severe anxiety for a long time and I can't really recall what ""normal"" feels like. Do I just keep upping the dose until I feel like it's too much, or not having any additional impact, and then go back down? Do I just stick where I'm at, since I am feeling better than I was? I've tried to look this up online without much success, so I'm hoping some of you will have some experience with this or some advice. (I do plan on talking about this with my doctor when I see her.) Thank you in advance!",Anxiety
"I?ve stopped taking antidepressants completely a week ago after tapering down for 6 months. I am doing ok, but I do take a small dose of beta-blockers when I have to go to work because it?s quite intense. After years of therapy I started taking antidepressants to help with my hypersensitivity and panic attacks. It helped tremendously but I really dislike the side effects so after about 3 years I decided to quit.

It?s not really a social thing, I?m an introvert but function perfectly fine in conversation and work. I am very bad with confrontation though. It?s more an overall hypersensitivity to noticing everything when I?m in public. It?s like antidepressants gave me the filter I needed, no longer noticing everything and just feeling more relaxed.

"Hello, I wanted to get some feedback on what people would do in my situation. I'm someone that has dealing with ongoing anxiety for the past 4 years. I have a job that I really like, and last month I had to take time-off because I got sick. After being able to manage my anxiety for a while, I got trapped again.  All my past experience with depression, worry, and feeling bad everyday happened in my home. It made me think about how I haven't made any progress to get better. I started working as a distraction to lessen my negative mindset. All I can remember feeling for the longest time is stress and worry. I finally made the choice to make an appointment with my doctor to prescribe me medication. I started almost 2 weeks ago, and I've never felt anything as good as it before. It scared me that I can actually think clearly, and it's something that I haven't felt in years. Now, I  don't know what to do about my job. I talked to my manager about taking time-off to see a counselor for behavioral health. I really want to tell him if I could take maybe 3 months off to get my anxiety in control. Honestly, I'm tired of feeling unfocused, and anxious all the time. I'm just worried that he'll tell me that I won't be able to come back. I really wish I could change the way things are.",Anxiety
I?ve recently noticed that when I?m getting all stressed and my anxiety gets really bad I automatically have a tingling feeling in certain parts of my body. Does anyone else experience this?

"Hey there, I would love to get some insight from people who recovered. I'm basically recovering myself as I never experience physical symptoms of anxiety anymore.But I feel like my emotions - in the present and also when I think about memories from childhood/ teenage years - are not as intense as they used to be before anxiety.It's wired because my memory is incredibly good, I can recall the slightest details from past events - but as I said, those emotions don't come up really.Now I wouldn't concider myself numb, because I'm able to experience joy and sadness etc. But it's not that intense.Is this something that someone experienced?

"I feel VERY alone with this. I really feel heavily drawn to true crime podcasts, documentaries and books, I was always really interested in the psychology of the perpetrators and the police work. But since I deal with anxiety (it started 6 years ago, after having my 1st child) I have a feeling it triggers my anxiety and panic attacks.Whenever I consumed true crime I have trouble sleeping for several nights, can't be home alone - especially at night -, can't deal with silence because I'll start hearing strange noises in and around the house and sometimes I'll have nightmares that can trigger panic attacks. I also noticed I started getting really paranoid of people not just for my own safety but for my kids safety as well. Pretty much every other person looks or acts suspicious in my mind.",Anxiety
"I still feel very drawn to true crime content and struggle to stay away from it completely but I think I need to make the choice to not consume this content AT ALL anymore for my own well being. That's one reason I stopped consuming daily news, which was much easier for me to quit.Whenever I tried to talk to someone about this people don't really get why I feel influenced as heavy by things like that and they don't really get why I'm even interested in true crime while also feeling triggered by it so I feel pretty alone with this problem.In the end all I would like to know is: am I alone with this or are other people triggered by true crime in that way just like me and started avoiding it completely?",Anxiety

 Not trying to make this a long post since it's 5am and I need to sleep. But I'm laying here with a bad feeling in my stomach and mind and I just need help trying to figure out what's wrong with me because it's ALWAYS on my mind.

My issue is that every time After I meet someone (usually a person I don't know well) and I like that person, and I want that person to think good of me, I get a strong feeling of insecurity and I always think about things I said or did that were less good. Even if I know a person likes me I still put myself down with thoughts about how that person dislikes me or thinks bad of me. 

 This happens so often I can't take it anymore. I'm tired of feeling this way every time I meet someone I really care about, I even get this feeling with some of my close friends, after meeting that person I think Hm he acted differently around me, maybe he doesnt like me anymore or similar thoughts. I understand it probably has something to do with insecurity but I'm not really an insecure person, in fact I am very outgoing and (act) sure of myself. But I also get nervous meeting these people because I care so much about what'll happen. 

It's so hard to put into words exactly how I feel but can anyone tell me why I constantly feel and think this way? Is this anxiety? I know a doctor would be better to discuss this with but I really cannot afford one and I figured reddit has alwayd been a great help. Thank you.",Anxiety

This feeling came around I would say at least a year ago and I kind of thought that it would pass as everyone does go through periods in their life were they feel low however it seems to have stayed and feels like a black cloud hanging over me which feels worse some days more then others , I come from a very loving family and live with my Mother and Stepfather as well as my younger 3 half siblings, I am very grateful for the luxuries I have in my life however there is so much going on within me some days I often wake up feeling very down for no reason at all feeling very worthless and lonely even though my family are very supportive and caring I couldn't ask for a better family. 



I believe my mental health has worsened due to finding out through family members that my biological father has been diagnosed with cancer and I guess this has made me realise that life really is so short, as a youngster my biological father was unable to be there for me and my mother due to his lack of love or care and the biggest blessing was my mother marrying again to a man who I can happily refer to as a real father, also a very close family member to me who I once spent a lot of time with has  recently tried numerous times to take their own life and being so distant from them for so long has not been a good feeling and has made me feel quite lonely as I am already an individual who does not really have true friends as I struggle to trust people, there have been many times were I have been invited out by others and have had to make up excuses for reasons not to go. There have been times were I have contemplated taking my own life as the feeling of worthlessness and sadness was at its most high, this feeling is very hard to explain and I am just looking for a bit of clarity on maybe why I am feeling this way or if others have experienced something similar I really would appreciate any help at all.

To individuals at work and university and others I meet I am often commented on being a very outgoing individual with a lot of confidence however deep down I often feel as if inside I am a totally different person which really does make me wonder how I became to be like this. I feel as if I lack the routine I once had in my life before and some days waking up feels as if I am just going through the motions, not long ago I would read everyday and would love to keep a journal to put my thoughts to paper, I remember heading to the gym 5 times a week running twice a week being full of energy living life to the fullest appreciating each day with those around me, where has the old me gone?. Often I have been told by others I am a very good-looking individual and in playful ways people have said"" You love yourself don't you"" or "" you are so cocky"" as I very much take pride in my physical appearance and enjoy doing my best to look as good as I can, the truth is recently I have been struggling everyday to keep a positive mindset and do the things I enjoy, having to put a mask on everyday is a task which I have become very familiar with I just want to know if others have felt the same and I would really appreciate any help which can be given I don't want to give up I don't want to carry on feeling this way I want the suffering to end or at least made easier. Thank you for taking the time to read this I apologise for any grammatical mistakes it is quite late in the night right now. ",Anxiety

"My anxiety goes through the roof when I at home living with my parents when I'm on breaks from college... So I thought going to college would be the peak of my anxiety with the coursework, rough  and unpredictable hours, and being away from home.  At first it was.  I've been struggling a lot trying to keep up with everything (it's been doable) and I thought I would get a break when every time I am able to go home and not need to even think about school.  It feels like almost the opposite effect.

I've developed my own schedule being in college and it's been the most comfortable I've felt in a while.  Going home though I feel so pressured and anxious about conforming to theirs.  Sleeping at an earlier time, being awake at an earlier time, no napping, going to the grocery store early (along with other outings) and if I'm not up I miss out, watching tv at a scheduled time with everyone, etc.  Not going along with it comes with disappointment from my parents, ridicule, and occasionally harsh words.  It just feels like so much I need to fall in line with that makes my anxiety freak out.  Because of my anxiety I struggle sleeping and I lose a lot of the oomph to actually get up and out of my room to do things which of course leads in to a snowball effect of me not being a part of their schedule, getting scolded, becoming more anxious, and repeat.

I get so anxious that I can't wait to go back to school and be stressed out and anxious over there than be at home.  I hate going home for breaks; and I don't think I should feel this way but my anxiety proves it for me.

I get so exhausted trying to deal with it all and I just really needed to get this off my chest.",Anxiety
"Looking to get help but not sure where to start I've been on venlafaxine for a couple months now and I've definitely noticed some progress, but I'm finding that I still experience pretty severe anxiety and depression. These spells are typically triggered by issues I'm having in my relationship with my gf or due to school related stress. I know that the issues are caused predominantly by my tendency to overthink and react unreasonably when I become upset and disappointed, and I really want to seek professional help in order to get back on the right track. I'm tired of having anxiety attacks and bawling my eyes out whenever I feel like something's wrong in my relationship or my life is going nowhere. Only problem is, I have no idea how to find a psychologist to talk to. For those of you who have successfully found a good psychologist, how did you do it? 

TL,DR: struggling with anxiety issues lately even though I'm on a med that has been working for me, and looking to seek out a psychologist to talk to. Unsure how to find help.",Anxiety
"WHAT TRIGGERS YOUR ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION? When we experience an unwanted intense emotion, be it anger, depression, anxiety or something else, often our reaction is more intense than it should be because something has triggered us. The result is an overreaction or disproportionate reaction. The easy way to know is to imagine if you had an absolutely perfect life, and if this was the first time that something bad happened to you, would you have reacted the same way? 

What is your trigger? Often it's not the situation itself but the feeling it generates, uncertainty, worthlessness, powerlessness etc. The subconscious remembers the pain of those feelings in the past, especially from trauma and especially from childhood trauma. When it gets triggered, the overreaction starts because the subconscious is telling you this is a life or death, fight or flight situation.

Get to know your triggers, just being aware of them takes away their most of their power over y",Anxiety
Alcohol Makes Everything Better--Then Worse I've recently turned 21 and started drinking because it took my anxiety away for the few hours I was drunk. It's great-- until the next day. I drank quite a bit last night and today my anxiety has been through the roof. I've had a severe feeling of impending doom all day and a few hours ago I got hit with derealization. Now it feels like nothing is real and I'm still feeling dread. Does this happen to anybody else? ,Anxiety
"Am I Dealing With Anxiety? I've talked about this before, but I'm in such a confusing, scary point of my life. I'm someone who's never dealt with anxiety, up until a medication I took back in May. I took two days worth of methylprednisolone and experienced my first ever panic attacks. The panic attacks continued for some weeks after, and since then just constant (most of the time) anxiety. We're in January now, and I still have these symptoms of anxiety. Sweating more than usual, increased heartbeat, muscle twitching, and the worst of them being occasional depersonalization. I've made it a priority to continue going out and living my life normally, but it's just not as enjoyable with all of this going on. I'm questioning whether or not the anxiety is natural, or if there's something else causing all of this. Some additional info: I'm a 22yr old male, pretty active, drink about a cup of coffee a day, and a weekend drinker with friends. ",Anxiety
"Chest tightness and nausea. Anyone else get anxiety from thinking about it? I've been feeling the physical symptoms so much lately.

Anyone else get anxiety just because you were worried about anxiety? I know it sounds stupid but I don't know what to do.

"How do I stop stressing about money I'm a teenager and I am super scared that my family will go broke/ not be able to live.

Therapy costs a fuck ton and I feel guilting for having to go through it. It's not even my place to worry about this because I don't even know how much my parents make. My dad is good at economics and says that we can handle it but I know we can't.

My mom has a minimum wage job, my dad works in an office, and we're paying for my brother's tuition. I'm so scared that my treatment for mental illness will be the reason why we go broke.

Is there any way I can just forget about the situation? I know worrying doesn't fix anything but it's constantly in my mind.",Anxiety
"I don't know how many people here can relate to this but it's worth a shot... So Im a 21yr old Black guy, and I grew up in a family where my dad speaks pretty much like a stereotypical Black man, and my mom speaks like a stereotypical White women. My dads family (who all speak like stereotypical Black people) lives in the city I live in so I grew up with them, and my moms family lives across the country and I have very little contact with them. I grew up being the only Black kid speaking like a stereotypical White kid (including within my own family), and I was never exposed to other Black people who spoke the way I did, so I have always felt a little awkward. 

How should I cope with this?",Anxiety
"I know I am annoying, I am really trying not to. But how? I hate it when I get a friend and then start behaving like a clingy fuck. That's why I stop talking to people, because I know that once I get attached I won't be able to leave and they always leave first.

Why won't people understand that I worry for them? That I want to talk to them and share ideas and listen and just have a good friend? I know I am clingy and I know I am annoying, I am just worried about people leaving, I worry about their well being, about their health, about wether or not they still like me.

It's hard as fuck trying to pretend you can be cool for other people when you feel yourself consumed in worry.

"I don't know what I have, or what to do if I do have anxiety I originally posted this in r/ADHD because I have that and I thought people there could tell me if I was just expressing symptoms of ADHD, but I feel like people with actual anxiety could help me loads more on this


I would hugely appreciate it if a few people read and responded, I'm sorry it's so long I just have a lot of thoughts. I don't know where to post this at all so I hope that by posting this here I might get some help from some people who think a lot like me. Ok so here's some vague background information. I'm in high school (male) and I haven't told anybody that I know that I have ADHD. I have known that I have had it since I was 8 and am medicated. Nobody knows except my parents. I honestly don't know if I am ever going to tell anyone ever. I used to have no friends up until about 2 years ago. That is when I met my current friends. Up until then I was really unlikable and got bullied a lot and often. Around that time I started caring what people thought about me and I think that is why people started becoming my friend. Fast forward about a year and I have good friends, but I worry a lot. I kept a journal too and I wrote down that I felt like it was for the better and that it was good to worry because if you didn't worry than people wouldn't like me. Around that time one of my close friends told me that he genuinely thought I had autism before he met me because I had an IEP for my ADHD (they would take me out of class 5 minutes early and check to see if my work was done). This made me worry even more about how people saw me. Around 2 years ago I also started often putting my hand in my hair and touching my face a lot without realizing it. I also kept digging at my nail beds too when I got nervous. I just thought this was my ADHD. This year has been very different for me. I feel like I totally changed. I am a quiet kid now when I used to be the one who tried to talk the most. I find myself knowing answers but not raising my hand because I don't want the attention on me. I don't know what to do though. I have a girlfriend and have a bunch of friends, but I always feel like kinda weird. I don't think I can describe the feeling fully. I always just feel out of place unless I'm alone. I also have kind of highs and lows where one day I'll feel good and confident and the next I'll be a mess and have lots of self doubt. I still often tough my face and put my hands in my hair and crack my knuckles and shake my leg even though I have tried many many times to stop. I have had this feeling that I have something else  than ADHD. I have trouble talking to people too because I don't know what to say. I find myself a lot happier when I am not face to face with people. I can't tell what it is though, I read a lot of articles and I think I might have generalized anxiety disorder too but I'm not sure and I don't know how I would tell. I don't feel comfortable telling my parents, or telling anyone for that matter. I just don't know what to do. If you read this far, thank you and I'm sorry this was just a huge rant",Anxiety
"So who else is dreading work tomorrow? *possible TW: self harm* 

So I am going back to work tomorrow after a nice few days off for the holidays. Due to some stuff that happened right before Xmas as well as over the holidays at my workplace (not situations that were my fault or anything, just stuff that happened within the company that will negatively affect my day-to-day; I am more anxious than ever about going in. Additionally, when I have anxiety it sometimes goes into suicidal thoughts. I was in a super manic state earlier and tried to cut myself (husband stopped me). 

My main problem with work though is that I am unhealthily attached to my work. I find my worth/value primarily in my work and I am a huge perfectionist to the point where my work is amazing but I am driving myself insane.

"Question about clonazepam/potential withdrawal side effect So I've been taking a low dose of clonazepam (half a milagram a day - sometimes an extra 0.25 if I need it) for about two years now (I'm also on Pristiq and a low dose of a generic version of topamax). I take it to treat anxiety, depression, OCD, PTSD, and PMDD.
In November, I thought I was good enough to go off my clonazepam because honestly it was hard to tell if it was doing anything after being on it so long. I didn't quit cold turkey but I don't think I tapered well. I skipped some days and other days I didn't and just...didn't do it right.
And I was wrong anyway - the clonazepam DEFINITELY helps my symptoms and I want to be on it. So now I'm getting back on it (taking .25 at breakfast and .25 at night). I've noticed recently my heart rate has been a little funny - it seems like it goes up and down a lot depending on whether I'm sitting or standing/moving. It's not severe, just strange. Has anyone else had this side effect and does it go away? I don't know if it's from withdrawing from the clonazepam or now going back on it or if it's totally random.
I'm seeing my psychiatrist in two days, but thought I'd see if anyone had any answers in the meantime. ",Anxiety

"On New Year's Resolutions I'm subscribed a meditation app and I saw a great suggestion for New Year's resolutions:

They suggested not setting yourself hard goals which you can fail and beat yourself up with, but rather on what kinds of qualities you want to have as a person.

This will give you room to improve, even if it's slight, you can say you became slightly more x(organized, respectful, kind to yourself, etc.).

I think those of us with mental health issues can easily struggle with failure, and then we tend to make a hard commitment and when we fail once it twice, we tend to think of ourselves as failures. I love the idea of making progress towards becoming who you want to be, growing into your desires rather than setting harsh limits on what you're allowed to do.

"Death anxiety, nighttime, and the flu I used to have anxiety about a lot of things, but with therapy I've managed to mitigate most of them. One of the remaining things I have is death anxiety.

So I haven't really slept much since I got this flu. I'm sleeping when I get so tired that I just pass out. If I try to sleep any other time, the anxiety just sneaks up on me and I end up getting short of breath and having to stand up and walk it off.

"Eating with anxiety I don't really know how to start this post so I'll just jump into it:

Whenever I feel anxious for whatever reason, I feel sick - sometimes bad enough to actually make me throw up. Of course when this happens I have absolutely no desire to eat anything but I'm always told (by parents, doctors etc) to keep eating because 3 meals a day is how to stay healthy and that its good for me but it makes me feel worse at the time.

Sometimes this isn't a big problem if the thing causing my anxiety is early in the morning because then I can eat normally for the rest of the day. If its later in the day however this could make me miss breakfast and lunch which is a bigger issue. 

For example, today I went on a trip out for most of the day and I've been feeling anxious about since I agreed to do it (maybe a week ago), I've been eating fine until today when I couldn't eat any breakfast at all.

My question then is first of all: what is your experience eating with anxiety? Second, is skipping breakfast actualy bad for you - could I have my 'breakfast' late at night instead? And finally does anyone have any suggestions of what to eat that is good in a nutritional way but in as few bites as possible?

(just to be clear, I don't have any kind of eating disorder - just have problems because I feel sick. Thanks for reading of you've made it this far ????) ",Anxiety

Restarting sertaline I used sertraline 50mg for about a year. The effects were that i was a calmer and more [concentrated](https://concentrated.No). 10 weeks ago i dropped it cold turkey.

"Trouble relaxing on days off Who else here really struggles on their time off work? I'm a floor nurse so I work 3 12-hour shifts a week usually and those are great.

What's worse is that I have a lot of things I've wanted to do since nursing school - getting back into playing piano, learning to draw, tons of movies/books/games to catch up on - but I just can't enjoy any of that except the first couple hours of the day and then when nothing gets done I just feel even worse lol.

"Why do my fathers tantrums get to me so much My (f/26) dad (m/70s) has (fairly minor) anger management issues. He works himself into screaming/swearing tantrums over things like his computer not backing up successfully, or his printer not giving the correct output, or not being able to find his sunglasses.
He's been this way since I was a kid, he's prone to moods where any and everything will set him off, and goes into the pessimistic everything is screwed etc spirals during these moods.

He's pretty good at not directing the tantrums at my mom and I (i also just avoid him when they start). However, he is also pretty routinely displeased with his life (he's an extrovert without many friends in a family of introverts - and my mom is nearly reclusive) and he's a perfectionist, so he never seems to be satisfied with anything in his life for long.
He's not willing or interested in pursuing therapy and has pretty much stated he's too old to change. Which is his decision. 

Unfortunately, even though I know these tantrums only last a day or so max and usually concern the damn printer, they trigger my anxiety like almost nothing else. I don't live at home anymore (in school) which helps, but being home for the holidays is difficult because Ik he loves me and misses me, and is hurt by my avoidance of spending time with him. But honestly his moods exhaust me and make me feel sick to my stomach when they start (I'm on an antidepressant which helps but not a ton in these situations), and over the years I've found it easier for my peace of mind to avoid being super close to him because I end up weathering fewer of his tantrums.

The issue is we've discussed his tantrums and how much they stress me out but he just can't understand why I take them so personally, and honestly he has no idea how else to express himself at this point (and is unwilling to learn). But he is also supporting me financially during school (which I am so thankful for) so me saying if you can't find a different way to express yourself while I'm home I won't have a relationship with you isn't an option (plus id miss my mom and it would cause problems between them).

So very (sorry!) long story short- how do I cope with the anxiety increase while I'm home, and feel less guilty when my dad is hurt that I'm avoiding him?

Tldr: dad has tantrums and gets very loud and upset which triggers my anxiety. How do I deal while I'm home?",Anxiety
"My least favorite thing about anxiety I try to mitigate the emotional effects of my anxiety disorder. I cannot control the hand I've been dealt so the best thing I can do is suck it up and deal with it. 

Some days I am better at that than others.

But the worst  thing... the worst fucking thing about anxiety is the heartdrop moment. I can be going about my day completely unaffected and then something to be anxious about will pop into my head. 

My heart drops, I get dizzy, I feel weak, my mouth dries up. 

Normally I can calm myself down, practicing a coping mechanism to prevent myself from spiraling into an uncontrollable state.  

Even then, though, the instants of anxiety are draining. My body takes a good 5~10 minutes to normalize again, and it roots itself in the back of my mind. I cannot feel safe until awhile later. This happens constantly to me. I cannot ever relax because it feels like my brain might betray me at any second and flare up my anxiety, forcing me to, once again, spend the mental energy calming myself down and ignoring the nagging feelings that I cannot fully escape.

"Anxiety and Panic about work. Physical symptoms approaching I have always had anxiety about work. If it was my part-time highschool job to my post college career I am in now. There has always been anxiety, the pieces have just been shaded a different color.

I have recently been encountering physical symptoms. My right arm, leg, and body have been tingling and stif for a number of weeks. have been had ER visits and my general practitioner has referred me over to neurology. I am concerned about what the entails, and even more concerned if my anxiety could be the cause of it. This leads to more anxiety over worrying about the symptoms. (Very spiraling I know)

"Anxiety and nausea/vomiting? I'm curious as to how some of you have effectively treated this. 

I'm wondering if this is simply one single problem or two separate issues. The main problem is severe reoccurring episodes of intense anxiety, severe nausea, intermittent abdominal pain and frequent vomiting. Could be once a year, could be 5 times a year. Symptoms can last a day or several days, leading to restlessness, lack of sleep and dehydration. 

Stress and menses could possibly be a trigger of sorts but otherwise there seems to be no pattern other than a ""feeling"" of an episode coming on followed by a slow build up of symptoms. 

Most oral antiemetics don't work when it becomes a full blown episode and then once the vomiting starts, obviously nothing will stay down. Taking stuff like Zofran, promethazine, Compazine etc may slow down the effect but generally doesn't abort it in severe cases. 

We've basically been to numerous doctors, a GI specialist. Lots of things have been ruled out but there was never a definite diagnosis. Everything is essentially normal medically speaking. 

So my question is: has anyone experienced similar symptoms and what proved to be the best treatment?

"Need Reassurance - Frightened I Will End Up Like My Dad, who has PTSD/Schizophrenia In the last 6 months, I have really struggled hard with derealization and anxiety; in the last few weeks, more of the latter.It is accompanied by obsessive thinking about fearful, intrusive thoughts, random spurts of heightened tenseness and panic, a general feeling of doom/emptiness, and more of that fun stuff.

Anyway, most of my life, my dad has lived with PTSD, earlier diagnosed as schizophrenia, brought on by a horribly turbulent, abusive and traumatic upbringing in his earlier years. His most predominant struggle with the illness(es) is that he hears voices (auditory/verbal hallucinations) that appear very realistic and are hostile and aggressive, and he is also paranoid/suspicious about random things. I have lived through some of his darker episodes and periods of these illnesses and seen and heard and experienced him doing some crazy, worrying, heartbreaking and infuriating things, and I believe as a result of being subjected to a prolonged and continuous amount of that stuff, it has left me with some mild anxiety issues over the years, however, in the last 6 months, out of nowhere, it has gotten immensely worse, along with my derealization. He has been in a comparatively far more stable state now for the better part of 2 years, but now in recent times, I have this obsessive, frightening, horrible fear that I too will start hearing things that aren't there and basically end up like my dad. It's causing me unbelievable distress and panic, and I'm constantly plagued with this ominous feeling and question the reality of subtle, more quiet noises, in fear that I am imagining them (i.e. little noises, like creaks in the house, high frequencies, etc.).

"Less procrastination, less anxiety, less depression Im a student now in the third year of college. Last autumn 2017 (second year of studying) i was trying to catch up with missing courses from first year, but i got very depressed and couldn't study at all and failed my courses again... I stayed home and got isolated since i had no social context or friends to hang out with, spiraling my anxiety and depression. I was sure everyone hate med. Things like going to the supermarket to buy food was extremely difficult. All the anxiety and failing to study made me feel like shit and worthless. This made my anxiety and depression spiral downwards.



In januari 2018, i began new courses, this time i went to the lectures and didn't stay home. I joined a procrastation support group, for students which have the same problem. The group meet up once a week and you set goals and evaluate yourself and e.g. get plus or minus if you met the personal goals for the last week, you then set new goals for next week. It might sound terryfying and harsh, but everyone in the group is very friendly and supportive. You set your own goal and noone judges, cause we all struggle with the same thing.  In the group i got new friends to hang out with and realised im not the only one struggling with procrastination and anxiety when studying. This combined with other things in my life like finding new friends, and joining activities made me feel way better this year. The spring was hard, but i got a little better at studying. Eventually this fall i progressed alot in procrastinating less. I made and followed my schedules and structure which have shown results in my studies. The structure makes me being able to relax when coming home, knowing i studied enough today. The result is my stress and anxiety go down alot. Compared to 1 year ago, life feels feels amazing.

"Positive escitalopram (Cipralex/Lexapro) experiences for high-functioning individuals I might be starting 2019 off with my first anti-depressant. My GP has suggested escitalopram based on my symptoms. Over the past 3-4 months (out of no where) I have experienced a few panic attacks and very high baseline anxiety. I also experienced mid-level depression that has fluctuated to periods of major depression. 

Essentially I've begun to get anxious in normal situations (talking to co-workers) and have experienced a strong diminishment in enjoyment of normal activities (my job, sports, etc). 

I believe that multiple life events in a short timeframe have created this situation (marriage, new home, new job - within a 12 month period). 

I'm looking for any experiences that high-functioning individuals have had on this anti-depressant. What I mean by ""high-functioning"" are just people that are actually working full-time jobs, have a supportive family, have friends and interests outside of work, are eating correctly, are working out and taking care of their bodies, are not abusing drugs, etc. As the research I have done suggests that SSRIs work significantly better for those in a high-functioning state (but experiencing a depressed/anxious disorder).

Anyway, this guy started throwing punches and I'm very lucky that my roommates got involved because this dude grabbed me by the shirt and threw me in my room and closed the door behind him. I'm also glad he didn't think about locking the door because if he did this would've been very different (I would've gotten mercilessly beat). Eventually I had to call the cops because the fight ended up involving 10+ people, and all because I made out with some dudes sister. My anxiety has been killing me. My poor neighbors saw the whole thing, him and his sister got taken away by the cops and I feel like their gonna retaliate to me. My night which I worked so hard to make everyone happy and satisfied, got ruined because I decided to make out with someone. ",Anxiety
"i??ve been prescribed Ativan for ""emergency situations,"" but i've been taking them almost every day this month. i've been so anxious it's been unreal. my living situation is up in the air ((i was supposed to move in with my boyf but all of a sudden we're not getting along)), i quit my job cuz they took uber advantage of me, and i've been isolating myself a lot as a result of all of my panicky-ness lol.



i do also feel optimistic-- i have two job opportunities lined up just waiting for me to say ""yes,"" i have another good housing option lined up, etc etc. but i just feel so anxious sometimes that i paralyze myself, and by that point i'm so worked up that i need an Ativan so i don't feel like imma have a heart attack.

"Has anyone else developed a new anxiety from bad dreams? I ask because im usually always having bad dreams. (Husband leaves me, husband cheats on me, my mom gets murdered, ect.) But I had a weird one recently that sparked a new anxiety I didn't really feel before.

I had a dream I dropped a second phone (which i dont actually have) and someone took it and ran away with it. They then proceeded to change my social media accounts and gain access to my visa and debit card due to them being in the phone case. In the dream I managed to cut the visa and not the debit, and was basically watching him change all my social media and use up my debit card through the phone I had. As I was trying to call the bank to get everything cut off I couldnt find the number anywhere (this always happens in my dreams) so I could basically do nothing.

So now im basically scared to bring my phone and my visa/debit card anywhere because of the irrational anxiety someone is gunna somehow take it. I know its irrational but i cant shake the feelings.

Any advice on how to cope? Has this happened to anyone else?

"How do I get help 2018 became the year when anxiety and depression took over my life. I'm not officially diagnosed but I spend most days either sad or stressed or worried. I've had several panic attack-esque episodes and often feel a sense of impending doom. I feel miserable a majority of the time.

I mostly have been telling myself it might be because it's my first year with a career and the first year of me living in a city by myself. But it's getting so overwhelming and my thoughts keep getting darker.

I want help. I do. But I also really don't want help. I hate the idea of seeing a counselor or therapist. I want to explore meds but am afraid of possible side affects or altering my brain state. I also keep telling myself that I had a healthy mind for years so I should be able to revert back. So really my question is: how do you go about asking for help or what options should I be pursuing?

"Outlet for Essential Tremors[?] Hi. I have been recommended to post my question here amongst others. 

I am looking for an outlet where I can talk with other folks who have Essential Tremors. 

Initially I searched for an Essential Tremors-themed Discord server then looked for movement disorders and even neurologically-themed ones, and found absolutely nothing.  I thought of creating my own Discord server designed for this exact thing but it's going to take some time it seems. I also looked into some support-groups online but it appears they've been extinct for some time (some forums haven't seen activity since the early 2000s).

"2019 Is Going To Be a Terrifying Year of Change for Me. 2019 is going to be a terrifying year of change for me. 

Im 20 years old and I'm in college. It's been almost a year since I've had a job and I lost all of my friends from narcissistic abuse. Aside from that, I'm in college for a music education, so I can lead worship in church. But i also at one point want to get my doctoral for psychology, and become a clinical psychologist. 

This year terrifying in the context of change. I'm not that bad when it comes to change, and im pretty adaptive with it too. But I'm terrified because getting a job, getting a liscence and eventually taking care of myself is a really hard thing to realize. I can't sleep normally some nights, and I find myself being slumped in bed all day not getting anything done, and feeling even more worthless because I didn't do anything. So I'm in a perpetual cycle of just self loathing and self hatred and laziness. I cant tell if this is depression, or actual laziness. 

Job interviews scare the hell out of me, and I hate phone calls. I used to be better with in in my last job, but long story short i worked with my abusive ex at the time. And she was the one that helped me get the job in the first place. Ive always thought I wouldn't have gotten the job if it wasnt for her. 

I have about a month before I need to get a job, and actually become an independent adult. Im excited for that aspect of it, but everything that comes with constant pressure to perform for superiors and dealing with disagreeable people in the work place, makes me want to cowar in a corner, cry and beg to never leave and to have me shot. 

I don't know if others can relate to this. And I know I'm just trying to make excuses not to work, but working isn't the issue for me... I'm a really hard working person when it comes to giving me a task. Im really quick with it too. But its the process of actually GETTING a job that makes it so fucking horrifying. 

If I don't, I'll most likely have to leave college for a while, and live with my parents up until i actually find a job to work. I feel so useless and worthless, and I just don't know how to get over my anxiety over it all. 

Im sorry for my rant. 

TLDR: im worthless and scared of job interviews, and working in general because people terrify me from judging me, and I cant get over my fear of it. I need a job soon so i can be a real adult and stop having my parents still take care of me. ",Anxiety

I wonder how long it will last this time, since it is ever fleeting, before I start doubting myself again, doubting about the friendships I have, saying that I am not worthy enough, not good enough to have such a friend, to be welcome, to be loved.

"Had a breakdown last night at work So here's the story, me and my manager made a plan with the schedule for New Years night because they scheduled everybody in their wrong positions. Another manager decided not to follow this and put me in a position I wasn't comfortable doing on New Years as it takes me too long to do the dishes so I wouldn't be able to handle receiving them all at 5am instead of 11pm. I got very emotional and felt like nobody cared about me as I heard managers telling my best friend no you're not doing her dishes for her and telling him basically to let me struggle all night. Then I was switched positions because the manager who made the plan with me told them he didn't want me doing dishes and wanted me in kitchen instead. I said thank you to him and was in a very good mood all night until 4am, where I had to drop a bunch of product by LATEST 4:30 and I had an hour and a halfs worth of work seeing as I was doing 3 different jobs. I started to break down, I cried so hard everybody saw it, I was yelling how I wish somebody knew how to help me, as there was 5 other people and none of them knew how to help me. My best friend was so behind he couldn't help me, he's still working past his shift because my finisher didn't know how to drop product by herself but insisted on being in kitchen so she would get him to do it.

I've helped make enough to help us stay afloat and was able to help make sure Christmas was still magical for our kids.

I knew tonight (or last night) would be a big deal, good money. All the time leading up to New Years I've been debating if I wanted to put myself through it with my anxiety. I've been doing OK but what if it was too much on me? 

I fucking nailed it. I made more in one night/morning than I'd made the whole week combined. I was sociable! I freaking went places I've never driven before. I don't know.

"My panic attack and anxiety made me miss work today. (trigger warning) *Trigger warning* *Panic Attack experience*
So a little backround, I'm 23 years old. 2 small children. I was a stay at home mom for a portion of the year until recently when I got a job as an expo in a kitchen..about a month ago. I was off Sunday so I decided to go out with my sister for the first time in forever, and have a few drinks. Without delving too much into it, I'm an extremely self-critical person. When alcohol gets involved I am 10x worse. I've had anxiety since I was about 12-13 years old, getting worse and worse over the years. I've had some bad panic attacks before, but today was the absolute worst one I ever experienced. So last night, conversations ran pretty deep and I carried everything into the next day. From subjects of my past and a narcissistist ex, let's just say my mental state of in a bad state of mind. I had work at 4 and was ok until about 20 minutes before I left for work. Me being new, I have some natural anxiety on top of what I was feeling today. 
About 3:30: stood up from the couch to get my shoes on. Hands buzzing, legs wobbly, dizzy. Starting to feel the attack coming on. Rushing out the door. 
3:45: Close to work. Panicking. Making fiance stop car several times because I could not breath. Throat felt closed. Heart racing. Thought I was having a heart attack. Mind knew it was panic, body did not agree. 
3:55: Pulling into work driveway. Made fiance park car. For the first time in my life my stomach felt physically sick from panic attack. Reached for closest thing to puke. Repeating ""I can't do this. I can't go in"" over and over for fiance. 
4:00: Call my best friend. Try to see if she can calm me down. In tears at this point. Heart racing. Sick to stomach and uncomfortable. Starting to feel disassociated. 
4:05: Hubby tells me either call off, go inside and explain, or clock in. Feel Frozen in fear. Afraid managers will think I'm faking it to party for new year's. (Did not drink at ALL tonight. Pledged that I'm never drinking again after today)
4:10: Go in. Host says I look really pale. I'm shaking. Heart still racing. Fighting off urge to faint. I'm now anxious about talking to managers even though they're all nice and understanding. 
I go to the kitchen and the manager sees me and immediatly asks if I'm okay. I explain and get told I have to get a doctor's note or else I'll get points. She's nice about it. My fiance came back and picked me up from work. He was very supportive, but I for some reason couldn't stand the driving motion as it was making me sick and panic. I have never felt like this before. When at home I called my sister and she somehow calmed me completely down from the panic attack. We relieve the babysitter and I go upstairs and lay  in bed and fall asleep for a hours. I still feel panic residue but much better. I have work tomorrow and very much do not want to go. If anyone has had a panic attack of this magnitude, I give you all of my kudos.

The main cause for me is definitely the fact that I'm soon going to be leaving my job to go to grad school and begin a new career path. I can handle the occupation, but not the imaginary bullshit about the future that my mind won't stop stressing over. 

So I don't have much else to say except that this is horrible and I joined this sub just now and clearly need to seek help because I literally did not know that anxiety could feel so deep and so bad. Fuck everything. ",Anxiety
"Happy New Year. May this be a clean slate to love ourselves again. To try and overcome all of out fears. To turn those fears into strengths. To learn from the lessons we learned last year.

"I wish I never had health anxiety Hello, I've had health anxiety since I can remember, when I was 12 I thought I was going blind and whenever I was 10 I thought I had Kidney cancer. Now I'm 15 (almost 16) and can't stop thinking I have a brain tumor.

It all started between 2017 and 2018. I was playing with some friends one night and played music at full settings for around 20 minutes or so, dumb idea and I don't know why I did it, but it happened. The next day I woke up with a bump behind my ear (pretty sure its an enlarged lymph node, or could just be bone that's been there the whole time. From time to time It has a little pain, like a small shock or pulse. I wouldn't be as worried but whenever I look up bump behind ear it usually says it goes away on its own in a few months and it's been almost 2 years? I also usually only have my headaches on the left side, but also have some on the right side. I probably just make myself think I have more on the left side, but it's so annoying thinking's I'm going to get diagnosed with a Stage 4 brain cancer or some other disease.

"Im grateful for the boss I have, and I'm stressing about the girl who got away. I can get really bad anxiety when it comes from girls I like. But what I'm going through is worse than anything I had before.

There was a girl I really liked earlier this year. She means a lot to me and she helped shaped who I am. I fought my anxiety and asked her out. She said no and never said why. I had a hard time taking it because I didn't know why. I couldn't be able to go to sleep because I couldn't stop thinking about why she didn't want to go on a date. I would only sleep because of mental exhaustion. I eventually burned my self into depression. At that point it was no longer about this girl, but depression taking over my life. Depression telling me I was  worthless, no one  cared about me, and that I  was going to be alone forever. I almost ended my life. My boss was the only person who checked up on me,even though I didn't tell him what I was going through depression. He used to call me in to work but not to work, just to talk. He helped me get out of depression and told me I have to push her away to heal, and I did that and I got better quick. My boss also helped me in learning how to pick up other girls and I went on a bunch of dates. I feel like I owe him a lot for the advice and helping with my depression. 

When I felt better I brought back the girl again. Initially I thought I could just see her as a friend. I told her why I needed space and time. She understood, she is incredibly nice person. I found out she did like me back but she was scared of commitment at the time. We started to talk and hangout again. Two months go by and I started to like her again.

I was scared to be in the same situation again so I told her I can't be her friend. I told her I can't be her friend because it would kill me if I saw her with someone else and that I don't even want to know if she is talking to someone. I told her I couldn't be in a relationship because it would have been long distance and I would start filling In the blank because of my anxiety. She understood and ended the conversation saying ""you every hear stories of people who are perfect for each other but couldn't be together because of timing and situation, I think that's us"" 

The next week was weird because I kept getting stories upon stories of ""the one who got away"". I've been dating for a couple of months and I didn't like any of them. I think I went on 20+ dates this year and about 6 relationships. One of them cheated on me and no one clicked. I got extremely scared that this girl would be the one who got away, and I at least need to try. So I went to talk to her and that I wanted a date. She used to like me, she said she likes spending time with me and talking to me, she said talking to me was different from anybody else. 

She couldn't go on a date because she was talking to someone she meet in college. She didn't tell me that, because I told her I didn't want to know if she had someone because I would get hurt. I did get hurt. That's why she said ""you ever here stories of people who are perfect for each other, but can't be together because of timing and situation"" She said she almost wants me to wait for her because she does want to try something, but they are committed and she doesn't want to put me in that position. And to be honest I would put myself in that position.

I spent all day at work thinking about what could have happened, what I could have done, if I worked harder to be in same college, the fact that she was scared to commit to me but she can't date me because of commitment, and many more things. We were getting busy at work and my family kept harassing me about something too. My chest hasn't gotten this tight since a long time. I went out to give my therapist a call, but the local business got mad and was yelling at me saying I was smoking and I ruined his lunch (I do smoke but never near his business, trying to quit though) I cracked and I started to have a panic attack. 

My boss stopped the man from yelling at me, told me to take a break, and eventually went to find me to talk to me. He took me to lunch and I explained anxiety to him and depression. And he understands what I'm saying more than my friends or family. He made me realize I was over thinking a lot of this. And I guess yeah I need time to heal but he is putting me on the right path again. 

He is an amazing person. He hired me to be a mechanic even though I didn't know anything about cars and didn't have any tools but I told him I desperately need a job with flexible hours. He motivates me to stay in stay college, even when I wanted to drop multiple times. He hasn't fired me even after the countless times of me fucking up. I'm grateful that he is my boss.

"New Years ruined. Some people came over to my house today for New Years. I really dislike them, they're honestly really annoying, but whatever. My family invited them.

A few minutes later after that, a family member asked to borrow some game I had to play with the annoying kid, which I proceeded to decline the offer. They proceeded to rant me, saying ""you're embarrasing everyone."" They took it anyway, and I started crying in my room, alone.

"Happy New Year! I'm so thankful for you guys. Looking back on 2018, I realized this last year was one of my worse years recently. 

Bad Things in 2018:

\- My anxiety has reached its worse in my whole life and I had no idea what it was until recently.

\- I realized that I did not make many long term friends after high school graduation

\- I had physical issues with my body due to anxiety and it made it worse

\- I had my first diagnosis that I had anxiety and potential depression





However, I am very grateful of many things that happened last year:

\- I just passed my first semester in college with the grades I wanted

\- My physical health has been better than its ever been before due to participating in college athletics

\- I have made many new friends and I got my first girlfriend :)

\- Recently, I have found the lord and I do not feel alone anymore in this world

\- I have began meditation and my mind has been much more clearer because of it



This year I will like to achieve these goals:

\- Meditate, no matter how long or short, every day this year

\- Show more love to the people around me. Especially my family

\- Posses a optimistic attitude!



Remember guys, just like everything in life whether it is the good, the bad, or the ugly, things will come and go. Anxiety is no exception.

"New Year's Celebration is one of my triggers As the title of this post says, today I've had the epiphany that the whole New Year celebration triggers me. 

It's not the people (I've learned to deal with big social gatherings a long time ago. I even enjoy them, if all the people in the room are from my inner circle). It's not the pyrotechnics or fireworks, I love them actually. It's common to believe that what triggers me is how overwhelming all of it can be, especially since I am diagnosed with Social Anxiety. But no, it's not any of it. 

You see, I have a terrible fear of failure. I always feel like I'm not doing enough. Like I'm wasting time. Work hours are never enough. Hobbies and activities to keep me occupied are never enough. I always have too much free time, no matter how exhausted I feel. 

People wait for the new year in hope of new things, new experiences and with the hope that the year to come will be better than the previous one. The new year is perceived as a new opportunity to start over, to do better, to try again, etc. 

But to me is just a gigantic reminder of how everything I'm doing is not enough, how the time is still passing, not stopping. Another year has gone by and I haven't done enough. And don't be confused, I always have that feeling, those thoughts, in the back of my head, every day. But today, it's insanely intensified, it's burning through every other thought or feeling and I can't seem to ignore it. And I know the change of year is just another date on the calendar, my logical thoughts remind me this. But my anxiety is just standing there, tapping annoyingly on her wrist watch, reminding me: ""tik tok"" and it's so loud. 

Social media only makes it worst. Seeing all the people celebrating and expressing how excited they are to what's to come and stuff like that. I already logged out of everything for today after the first 4 or 5 posts lol. 

And that's it. I don't know, I just wanted to vent out. Feel free to coment anything. For those of you who don't have this thoughts especially and don't get triggered by this as I am, Happy New Year, blessings and good vibes. ",Anxiety
"I'm unraveling. In celebration of 2018 and all the progress I made with depression, I decided 2019 would be dedicated to coping with anxiety. For me, anxiety has always been a more subtle and covert emotion than depression, thus making it harder to deconstruct and work through. When I'm depressed, it's very obvious to me, but when I'm anxious, it can be hard to pinpoint because of how long I've lived with it (it feels normal) and how it tends to hide, expressing itself through other emotions. 



With that in mind, I decided to get to work and start brainstorming the ways I can detect my anxiety and understand what exactly causes it. I've learned that when I want to work on things like anxiety, depression, etc. I have to dig in head-on. This led me to a TED talk by therapist Brene Brown called ""The Power of Vulnerability"" and she discusses her professional and personal findings on shame, fear, guilt, lack of self-confidence, and vulnerability. 



Long story short, after some soul-searching, I've realized I have a deeply-seated lack of self-confidence and this realization has utterly shaken me to the core. It's as if I've spotlighted anxiety, hiding in the bushes all this time, and by doing so, I've elucidated how much it affects facets of my life. I realize now why I fear relationships (friendly and romantic) and affection, yet deeply long for a partner and feel pain when I see my two closest friends together, dating. I realize how much I place my own self-worth in the hands of others and subsequently, why I struggle to be content in my own company. I realize how much I live off of affirmation from those around me and how truly inferior and lacking I feel to my peers.



This massive realization has utterly ruined me for the last two days and I just ask for some support, advice, and comforting words please, at least to hold me up until Wednesday, the day of my therapy appointment. I'm experiencing so many emotions at once-- grief, shame, fear. What were once quiet hums have turned into booming, overwhelming thunders and it's so difficult to cope. Every small thought transforms into a giant spiral of negativity and catastrophization. I've had to quit playing Minecraft, a game I find calming and soothing, because simply the \*thought\* of messing up a house and having to start over makes my chest tight. This is hell.

"My job is giving me terrible anxiety I recently started as an accountant which I thought would be chill, but it's everything but. It seems like everything is a crisis, and people are demanding payments and updates constantly. The company I work in is in marketing, and the people are so high strung. I'm working non-stop from the moment I sit down at my desk to the second I get up to leave. *Everything* there makes me feel like I'm going to cry or shake, I feel as though I'm always on edge.

I'm getting a certificate to change to a job in my field, but that could take a few months. I envy the people I see opening the little mom-and-pop shops I pass on my way to downtown, or those working at a trendy thrift store for minimum wage.

This is his response almost every time that I get stressed out or sad. He questions why it is happening and when told he denies my feelings.

"Has anyone been able to stop using anxiety/depression medication? Hi Guys!



I was just wondering if anyone has been able to stop using medication for anxiety and depression and be back to their ""Normal"" self or just better self? I have had two instances were I didn't take my second dose, which led to not taking my medication at all. primarily because if I felt fine with the dosage cut in half I thought maybe I would be ok without taking it at all. not at all the case. I ended up having a panic attack at work and my emotions were all over the place. the second time I it happened was not really by choice, I was transitioning between jobs and ran out 3 weeks before my new insurance kicked in. I had the same symptoms and I was out of refills and the pharmacist refused to help me (not sure what protocol is for that but I was about to ball my eyes out in front of her, I take Zoloft and buspar, not like I was asking for a handful of Xanax..)

I am young, mid teens, and a couple years ago I indirectly went through a traumatic event. My mother was harmed in a large terrorist attack, and unstable for around 10 months. The first day was tough because I spent 5 hours with a hunch that something was wrong (I overhear about a shooting right where my mom was, teacher gets a phone call, his jaw drops, and stares at me for 3 minutes) , but unsure, until my older brother picked me up and told me the news. Anyways I definitely have PTSD, as I start crying uncontrollably during unexpected drills of any kind and will do literally anything to get information during lock downs. 

My family moved to a new town recently, and I went into a new school completely different from my old school. It is very challenging and needs a lot of work and dedication. I made a few close friends pretty quickly and got used to it, but the school is really far ahead of my knowledge, especially in the sciences. One time in chemistry, I got really nervous and shut down: looking down, trying my hardest to not cry, and zoning out for a good 30 minutes, until I could get out of the class and into my world history class, which I love.

This is the most fitting real example I can think of:

Before the holiday break, me and someone I like a lot spent our WHOLE last day together, just enjoying each other's presence as a way to say goodbye. At the end of the day we wished each other happy holidays and parted ways. It seriously couldn't have been more genuine and beautiful.

Guess what I've been obsessing over for the past two weeks: They didn't give me a hug when we parted ways. That's it. Now I convinced myself that it's over and we won't talk to each other ever again.

Why do I have to always think like this? It makes me feel so worthless and unwanted sometimes...",Anxiety
"Starting a new job tomorrow and am having intense anxiety about it and can't stop crying Don't get me wrong, I'm super excited for the new opportunity and to be employed after getting laid off a few months ago. But I'm absolutely terrified of making mistakes, co-workers not liking me, not understanding even the most basic concepts, being slow (I'm OCD and ADHD, which makes it very difficult for me to get things done in a timely manner) and being terrible/incompetent at my job. I've been letting the tears flow the past hour hoping it would help, but my fear and anxiety is just getting worse. I feel like I should be much stronger handling this.

"do i have anxiety????? fuck idk
ok so im 14.
and uh i think i have social anxiety???? idk because i know friends with adhd and anxiety and depression so i dont like to self diagnose myself because it seems disrespectful. i talked to my bff, who has adhd and her about me having some type of anxiety.

oh real quick: i HATE my having picture taken, i already have severe self confidence issues and it always makes me want to cry when my mom says ""lets take a picture of you"" because i hate it, and just like 30 minutes ago, my mom met with her cousin (we are traveling for family in NC and on our way back to texas we decided to stop for her cousin)  and she made the waiter do it, and i almost cried because i just cant. and on my birthday my mom wanted to take pictures but i completely refused and now even thinking about it im sad and upset because she doesn't have birthday pictures for this year (last year technically ig) and i feel really bad :(((

and then when we were going towards NC, we stopped in Alabama and my burger was a crunchy rock and i don't really like that and my step dad said to the waiter ""get her a new burger"" and i just died because i said quietly ""no its ok"" but he doesnt listen and i started panicking and told my mom ""im not hungry so im ok"" and she finally told the girl nevermind but i wanted to cry and got in a really bad mood right after that and when we got to the hotel and my parents were asleep i cried because igfnjdenneeknwbsjdjs idk odkfidkdkfkdkd

backstory on my step dad rq: he got into a 18 wheeler accident and it messed up his head and he turned super mean and irritable after that so ???????? 

and i always get uncomfortable around him and stuff because he's kind of an asshole and idk and my mom is super insensitive and ive asked like ""mom can you get me therapy or something"" and she said ""no, pay for ur own therapist"" and so i never asked again and idk what to do because i had a bad thing with self harm and i stopped early but i did it again a few weeks ago and stopped because idk but at the beginning when the teachers found out and she did too she would make jokes about it and it hurt my feelings really bad. ive told her once ""i think i have anxiety"" and she just went ""no its just a teenager thing"" but i finally looked up social anxiety and i have literally all of the symptoms but idk because no therapist or diagnoser person thing to tell me??m?jssjjsndiwksk

idk idk idk idk idk idk

god and she never helped me when i got bullied either 
in 4th and 5th grade a boy named anthony bullied me and just this weekend we were at my grandmas house and looked at old pictures and it made me sad because i could wear clothes i wouldn't even think about wearing back then but now i completely hate myself and have voices

I recently realized why I feel like shit most of the time. I feel bad because I believe that there is something inherently wrong with me (that I am not normal).

And I struggle everyday because I want to feel better so I try to reframe my thoughts, but then, there is a part of me that thinks: why change the unchangeable? 



I constantly feel like I am fake and unauthentic. I am constantly repeating that I am a crazy and bad person. It's exhausting.



I don't filter anything I say because I am looking for reassurance by others ... but it never works. And saying things without a filter cause me anxiety.

My head just gets filled with negative thoughts not just with jobs but every aspect of life. I see a lot of people struggle but build on success, that doesn't happen with me I've interviewed for a single job (in retail) and it got offered to me and the interview went well and I couldn't take it because of the hours but since then I'm too afraid to apply for even a retail job.

"Sudden distress and anxiety over touching any part of my body with my fingers (including one another) I don't know if this belongs here, but coming to a subreddit like this seemed fitting.



I've been feeling fearful, or nervous regarding just regular and completely harmless situations and things. I can't recall any example right now, but really common daily events like someone giving a newspaper to another (just an exemple), might make me feel that way.  


I started feeling fearful again (I'm always somewhat anxious or stressed, but it peaks several times) some time ago, and then I started feeling nervous/scared for some reason about my fingers touching one another (typing right now with hands as spread out as possible) or other parts of my body and it produces a big discomfort when they do.



This probably sounds crazy or fake, but I actually feel it. I also feel like I'm choosing to have this reaction somehow (?), and that I could snap out of it, but instead their touching is causing me distress and making me cry.

  
I've been through some really stressful times, specially since October, and I think it's related to that.

So I start uni (Canadian Uni if that matters?) tomorrow and I have never felt so afraid. Today I had a little test run because I went in to get my books and ID. I couldn't get rid of this ridiculous idea that everyone in line was watching me (as I was just wandering around cluelessy) and I finally went up to ask a question. Turned out my books weren't ready and she said it so loud I knew people heard and I just couldn't handle it. I went back to the car and drove to ship something, forgot to pay and felt more ashamed. Im kind of spiraling right now. I could really use some advice of how to go about starting school again. Its been 3 years since highschool. I just feel like im always being watched or judged.

"I want to make a short film but my I feel silly about bringing it up. I don't actually know if my particular issue deserves to be in this subreddit but here goes..

As the title says, I want to make a short horror film. I want every one working on it with me to be my friends. I have tonnes of artistic and talented friends in all departments who could help, and would help if I asked. But whenever I sense the perfect opportunity to ask, I bail. I feel silly about wanting to make a movie, especially when I have no experience or even any qualifications that remotely tie in with the film industry. It'll be my first ever project like this, and probably the biggest thing I'll take on in a long time. But, again, bringing the idea up is halted by an anxiety that really has no reason to be their yet it is anyway. 

Not sure what I'm hoping to get out of posting this, I guess I just wanted to speak my film making dream into existence but with the anonymity of Reddit so that my anxiety about telling my friends/family might go away soon. 

Anxiety has effected me for a very long time. My biggest triggers are public transport and being in crowded spaces but not knowing anyone who is there, and since neither of my triggers associate with my current issue it leaves me puzzled. If there's any methods or just something that can possibly help me get over it I'd be very grateful. ",Anxiety

"Trying to rest in my doctor's message rather than read into it. Trying to not do stupid things prior to my visit. I found what appears to be a lump or hard vein on my shoulder. At first I thought it was cool. I'd been working out (as a part of anxiety treatment), and like a dork, thought it must be a sign of fitness! Big muscles popping the veins out like on TV, RAWR!

Well, there went my moment. Then I decided it wasn't a vein, it's a tumor. Then I decided it's a vein again, with a clot. So I took some pics, put them on AskDocs, and got ""probably nothing, but could be something awful so get it checked out."" My doctor is a saint, and told me to message him on MyChart about this sort of stuff. I described it, sent a picture, and within a few hours (again, like a saint, as standard for this program is 2 business days) said ""it doesn't look urgent, if it gets much worse let me know.""

Awesome! I'm not having DVT of the arm! And then I went downhill. ""But there's a lot of bad options between healthy and urgent. Why didn't he say 'fine, nothing to worry about?'"" ""If it gets \*much\* worse? So is it already bad?"" ""Are we in a phase where it could be terrible, but we need to wait and see if it develops? After all, we don't always remove malignant tumors the same day as diagnosis.""

So I went from celebration to number of cognitive distortions telling me that what we are dealing with is something pretty bad that can wait a few days, with a potential beat the clock mechanism.

"I can't grasp my emotions Constantly I have been feeling two-sided with how I feel. When I experience something, I may feel a certain way, but my reaction would be totally different. There are many scenarios where I felt this. I have been told by a friend of mine that at times when I'm not preoccupied/distracted; when I'm waiting for the bus, eating, and such, I appear angry, though at times like that, I don't really have anything going through my mind. I decided to try to cease the angry image and relax, but instead, I shifted to a ""looked like I was about to cry"" image. Most of the time, I can't really describe my attitude, it's not that I don't feel anything, but there isn't a feeling to describe me. I simply exist.

When I was younger I abandoned my feelings. I was extremely self conscious so I tried to fit in and once I understood that I couldn't fit in, I tried to change. Despite my efforts, I was still seen as insignificant, I believed no matter what, I wasn't enough. Understanding that my efforts where hopeless, I gave up. I stopped trying to put effort, to care, to value life. I purposely separated myself from others, I tried to stop feeling.

I understand that this was a bit dramatic and this story sounds like fake self diagnosed depression, which it probably is, but the problem still stands, and I want to start putting effort into being more expressive with how I feel, instead of feeling like nothing. Of course I still have emotions but they are buried. How exactly can I regain the emotions that I've dug?

"Owning a dog again is giving me extreme anxiety and stress Long story short, About 6 years ago I lost a dog to a tragic accident that was my fault. It haunts me still and I still feel incredibly guilty.

I had a lot of stress and anxiety after that event when it came to pets and life in general. But recently I got on anti-anxiety meds and things have been feeling better.

I was tired of feeling lonely and wanted a sense of companionship so I went to get a puppy. Well in the process of that I ended up fostering 4 puppies for a week because the shelter had no room for them. I really got connected with one of them and I was set to adopt him.

Then at the end of the week he went in to get neutered (required by the shelter before adoption) he passed away. They think it was due to a heart condition.

That tore open my old wounds hard and I swore off pets for life.

That was four months ago. Now, 5 days ago my fathers friends dog had puppies and wanted to give me one of them for free. After long contemplation and talking with my family I thought maybe it would help things.

I was wrong. For the past 5 days I have been so incredibly stressed and anxious about the puppy. He's incredibly well behaved for a puppy and there's no real reason I should be but anytime he's not in my sight I just feel like I'm not being a good owner.

I worry I'm not giving him enough exercise or training him well and it feels like I have a huge weight on my chest and I can't breathe. I know this is all probably just me subconsciously worrying something's gonna happen again but I'm in agony. I barely sleep at night ironically worrying he's gonna wake up and bark a bunch, waking up my family.

It'd be cruel to give him away and give up on him now. He learned his name. He's potty trained. He sleeps in his kennel at night relatively hassle free. 

I don't know what to do but I feel horrible all the time.

"How do you deal with Nocturnal Panic Attacks? I've had this issue that has popped up over the last several months where randomly while I am in bed sleeping I suddenly just feel this rush of panic hit me and blood starts pumping faster and my heart starts racing and I shoot out of bed. But often times my legs are weak since I take quetiapine to sleep. And then its just this back and forth where it feels like Im about to pass out, I roll around, drink water, stand up, emotions are all over the place and I want to call 911 but I wont because the last 3 times I went into the VA ER for ""heart palpitations"" or whatever I was experiencing I ended up having nothing wrong with me that I needed to be in the ER for. There is no consistency to the attacks, I've gone a week without it, then I'll have one, then I'll go a month, but I'm asking this question now because I've had really severe panic attacks at night 3 of the last 5 days, last night I was on the verge of puking it was so bad.



So, what can I do outside of drinking water or trying to take a deep breath? I've read on a couple sites I should just get up and go downstairs and fully wake up by doing something for 30-60 minutes until my heart rate has lowered. I just wanted some more personal opinions from people on this.

"Does anyone else twitch a lot due to anxiety? Hi guys! I am a person who has always struggled with anxiety, and I ended up marrying someone who has just as bad anxiety as I do (although it manifests itself in different ways). While I have been in therapy and taken medication for nearly 15 years for my anxiety, my husband was never allowed to see a therapist (controlling parents) and never considered he might have anxiety himself until recently, when he started sitting in on some of my therapy sessions and talking things out with me. 

To get to my point....my husband twitches a lot. A LOT. Mostly facial twitches, but lots of whole body jerking type twitches sometimes as well...especially when eating. When he is eating, his body will jerk and his eyebrows will twitch so much that he has to stop and take a big deep breath before he can continue. This is something that his dad does as well, and one of his brothers...so I just considered it to be a learned trait even though his twitching was on a way more extreme level than either his dad or brother. 

But it seems to be getting way worse over the past year or so. We've been going through rough times lately and he's been feeling very anxious. When I have commented that his twitching seems to be getting worse, and that perhaps it's related to his anxiety...he freaks out and says that it's just a thing he's always done and it can't be anxiety because his dad and brother do it too. He comes from a family that doesn't believe in mental illness so anxiety isn't a ""real thing"" to them. So I think his defensiveness about exhibiting anxious behaviors stems from that, which is totally fair. But is this something more than likely caused by his anxiety....or could it be a more serious, medical concern he should get checked out?

"Tips on curbing stress from relationships? Long story short: I'm seeing this woman. Things are generally great when we're together, but we have a somewhat complicated history in terms of how things got started. Because of this (and other things), she wants to take things slower than I'd prefer. I'm at the point where I want to turn things into a committed relationship, but she's not there yet and wants to keep things open for now. She's open to the idea of becoming a couple, she's just not there yet.

This is causing me a ton of anxiety that I'm trying REALLY hard to cope with. After I ruined a date a couple weeks ago having an anxiety attack in front of her over it, I know I need to get a better handle on things so I don't scare her away (she was a saint about the situation and it seems she's let the whole thing go, but I can tell it added to her reservations and I really, really regret it...)

The biggest stressor right now is that she's dating someone else too. She's told me a bit about him (at my request, I also told her about another woman I was seeing but have since stopped dating). With me being at the point where I don't want to see other people, every time I think of them together my brain starts racing. 

The thing that frustrates me is that I know how irrational it all is: they're no where near as close as we are. She hasn't even kissed him yet; they've only been on a couple dates and she only talks to him a couple times a week. And it's not like it's cheating because we're not even a thing yet. 

But still my brain just goes nuts. They only go out every other Saturday due to scheduling. There's another date this Saturday. I'm looking for any advice anyone can give on how I can try and get a better handle on my anxiety over this situation. I'm usually able to calm myself down by just reminding myself what our relationship CURRENTLY is, not what I want it to be, and I'm trying to plan distractions for that night, but it's just tough.

I always push too hard and want to get to that next step. In everything I do. I'm too impatient. 

And I'm terrified that if I can't get a handle on this I'm going to scare her away. I'm absolutely crazy about her and I don't want to fuck this up, but I'm scared that me being scared of doing so well become a self-fulfilling prophecy.",Anxiety
"Constant Work Problem Induced Anxiety Hi all,

This Christmas period I've been suffering really badly with anxiety. I don't get it often and it's only ever been related to work stuff.

Last time was a few years ago, and an issue at work has brought it back again.

I have a knot in the pit of my stomach that never goes away. Even though I've had a lovely time with family and friends, this gnawing feeling is always there.

I live alone and when I'm home I'm constantly running over scenarios and conversations in my head which only gets me stuck in a loop and driving anxiety levels up. At some points it's like I'm having back to back panic attacks for extended periods of time.

My rational self knows this work stuff isn't that important... but I can't shake it. I go back to work next week and I'm hoping the thing will get resolved quickly. [as an aside it's not like I'm losing my job or anything, it's an ongoing issue with an employee in my team]

my therapist told me i overthink a lot, and i have to practice things like thought stopping and cognitive disassociation. my will is pretty bad, but i've been getting better.

has anyone dealt with something like this? if so, how did they move past it? i just hate that i'll be doing well for like, a week or 2, but then suddenly i'm sad for a couple of days.

sorry for how jumbled this sounds.",Anxiety

"I have to spend many days alone with nothing to do. Anxiety going through the roof. Advice to deal with it? My life has gone to shit lately, piecing it together. Quit job, moved home to parents. Living with them and going to be getting mental health support before getting a job again.



I have about a week or two before I will receive any mental help. In the meantime, I have no friends here, my vehicle just broke down and I can't drive. All my hobbies are outdoors but my parents house is in the city. I have slight interest in books/movies but not really. Besides that, there is literally nothing else to do. 



Being alone with nothing to do, my anxiety is going through the roof, I lose desire to do anything, no energy, so miserable and unhappy, can't stop worrying. Hours feel like forever, I wish I could just be put into a coma for two weeks. How can I deal with this?

"IBS and Anxiety Hey guys, 

After my post a couple of days ago, about having **IBS** as well as **anxiety**... 

I realised just how many people are in the same boat as me, it's actually quite comforting to know **we're not alone!** 

So with that in mind, I have created a new [IBS Support Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/ibsociety/) on Facebook to try and build a really supportive community for us all.

We can give each other tips, reassure people when they are overthinking things, share stories and other things that will help. Here's a link to the group, hopefully you find it helpful [https://www.facebook.com/groups/ibsociety/](https://www.facebook.com/groups/ibsociety/)

"Does anyone experience physical discomfort cause of anxiety/depression? I've had an extreme panic attack some weeks ago and since that that I've been feeling anxious almost every day. I often feel very nervous, and this feeling comes up random too. Like i could be feeling fine and one minute later i don't feel good anymore. I feel this pressure in my chest sometimes, nausea and sometimes dizzyness. But often just an uncomfortable feeling in my body, which is making me feel so depressed lately.

I haven't been using my laptop for a month now. It has been a constant source of anxiety for me ever since I first got it 9 months ago( I bricked it in the first month) ever since then the smallest problem has been enough to make me a nervous wreck. I'm afraid that after not using it for so long the amount of applications trying to update at the same time will crash it and kill it, even though Ive read thousands of thread saying that won't be the last . After writing this I can honestly say that I feel so much better and that my anxiety has vanished. For those of you who made it this far, writing out my irrational anxieties like this really helps me understand and see how irrational I'm being and calm my down, hence the purpose of me writing this post. I want to let you all know that I appreciate you all and that your anxiety does not define you, instead it only serves to hinder you. Do not let it. You are much more than your human nature unnecessarily amplified and I am CERTAIN you will get through it. The best of luck and God bless",Anxiety

I need to start making money somehow, but whenever I try to work, my anxiety gets way worse and forces me to leave. I've been trying to get on BC financial assistance for upwards of a month, but the number of hoops they're making me jump through is ridiculous, and now I'm finding out that they're only going to give me $400, which doesn't cover much of anything.

"PCS or Anxiety? So background: about 4.5 years ago I suffered a pretty bad concussion and did nothing to treat it and made it worse, developing PCS. Mostly in the form of anxiety and panic attacks (mainly related to my health), which I had no sign of before (I was 22 at the time). It took about 3 years but for the last year-ish I have beaten the anxiety and seemingly the PCS, feeling like myself again.

Well about two days ago I was unloading my car and hit my head on the trunk, snapping it to the side. I was walking at a slow speed and it was the underside of the trunk which isn't particularly hard, but, my head did whip back a bit. I stunned myself, but, didn't lose conciseness and remember the whole incident. Immediately all those feelings came back and I felt like I had another concussion. Ive felt in a fog for the last two days and am panicking that I just screwed myself and am in for another long recovery. 

I know 3 days removed I most likely won't be diagnosed even if I go to the doctor. Is there a way to tell if it really was a concussion or am I just having anxiety over the idea of the PCS returning. Is something I can do to help my situation.

I thought I was going to be okay.

Just something to not have to walk the world alone lime this. You are all out there and yet I never see you. Maybe having a connection in my pocket to help and be helped would be something though.

I knew I had to change. I was sweating bullets and hyperventilating when I pressed the book button all those months ago, but I did it. I booked a three week trip to Thailand all in my own. 

Now, the trip is 4 days away. On Sunday I get on a plane to fly over the ocean for the first time, to a country with a different language and culture, all alone. 

My job fired me for taking this trip. They told me if I took it, I'd be fired, but I took it anyway. Another brick to the pile that is my endless anxiety. I'll be coming back completely jobless.

Everything is piling up and I can't stop worrying. I have had two attacks today and I can't sleep or eat, worrying about packing and flights and being alone in a strange place and WHY I ever thought I could do such a thing when I can't even talk to cashiers at the supermarket!! Why did I do this?!?! Why did I think I could do this?! I'm so worried about not getting anything done that I'm not getting anything done! I can't stop freaking out.

Alright so for years I thought I would have depression because I kept having these suicidal thoughts. Well last year I was hospitalized and a doctor informed me that what I have is not in fact depression but anxiety.

"I haven't sought help because I'm worried that I use my anxiety and depression as an excuse for being an awful person. I've had severe symptoms of anxiety and depression since 2008 for a multitude of reasons. I've self harmed and I actively have suicidal thoughts. Other than the therapists my mother forced me to see throughout grade school, I have never actively sought out a councilor or medical professional about my situation. There are several factors in play here such as cost and general distaste for therapy (most likely due to my past experiences), but the main one is fear. Not fear that it won't work, but the fear that it will. Who am I when I'm not depressed? How do I go about my day when I do not have anxiety? Considering these mental conditions are ongoing battles that no one is ever truly rid of, these aren't realistic postulations, I know this. And yet I worry that even if I were to get a handle on them, I won't change as a person. I worry that I'll still neglect my friends, shirk my responsibilities, and lie about 60 times a day for reasons I don't even know anymore. I worry that my selfish self is taking advantage of my mental illnesses that other people are suffering from so much that they are actually killing themselves over it, and I'm afraid to know the answer to that.

"Anxious parent of little kids, Crohn's, and the non-existent appetite So, here's my dilemma.  I'm a dad of two beautiful little girls, ages 5 and 3.  Everything is great and I love being a parent.  For some reason though, ANYTIME the girls get sick or appear to be coming down with anything (cold, flu, stomach bug, whatever), it triggers my intense anxiety.  I get super anxious, in part, because I don't know how to help them when they're sick, however, I don't really panic in the moment, nor do I try and run away... I more just suffer in silence and handle whatever needs to be handled.    


The internal side effects of my anxiety is that my body basically stops functioning properly.  I 100% lose any appetite that I had, I tend to not eat for a week or more at a time.  And I ultimately lose a lot of weight.  I fluctuate anywhere from 160lbs to 185lbs in a given cycle.  When things are anxiety free, my eating habits are totally normal as soon as anxiety is triggered, it's a 100% boycott on food...  Like,  I couldn't even force myself to eat if I wanted to...    


It's also worth mentioning that I have crohn's disease too.  I feel like the crohn's flares up when my anxiety does and vice versa (anxiety when crohn's issues begin).   I mostly manage my crohn's systems with diet versus medication.  I take an anxiety med (buspar), that sometimes seems to help but most often doesn't seem to help at all for controlling my anxiety.  


I feel like I've scoured the subreddits for someone with similar struggles but I haven't really seen much.  Does anyone else experience something like this?  Or just intense anxiety with child illnesses?  How do you cope?  


I've been trying to cope lately by telling myself that ""Everything is going to be just fine, kids get sick and that's just the way it is.""  and ""We'll get through this, because we always get through this"" and ""One sick day out of 365 days a year, isn't the end of the world"".  Sometimes it seems to help, sometimes it doesn't.  Fortunately, I have a very supportive wife who is always willing to step in and do extra when I can't handle things sometimes.  I'm very grateful for that, but my inability to be myself in certain situations just adds to the anxiety.

"Keeps getting worse I believe I have severe (social) anxiety, especially Agoraphobia. It has occurred over the recent years, and it seems like it's becoming worse. I grew up in a small town with all my friends and was very popular throughout my school-years. I moved to the city 3 years ago to study, while all my friends remained. It was hard committing to new friendships, since I always went to see my old friends during the weekends. The anxiety thing for me started with class presentations, then evolved into an extreme nervousness if a teacher asks me a simple question during class. In those situations I'll be sweating excessively, which is very visible and embarrassing. I faked an illness this Christmas, even though it was only held for my family members, nothing special. I simply hate having dinner, because I'll start sweating like crazy. It's insane, I become nervous by talking to my family members, I mean when has it come this far and where is it going? 

Because of past instances I have an extreme fear of certain situations, and it is all in my head - I just cannot get it out. I know that I'm a well-looking person, I'm loved, smart and there are plenty of people who are looking up to me, so all of this is ridiculous. It has come to the point where it affects my mood, grades, social life, and I find myself tired all the time. I wish I could erase the last 3 years of my life because it's not who I am, and I have people to testify that. Sometimes I find myself trying to convince people that I'm at least as cool and popular as they are, but how would they know from what they have seen of me? I heard cigarettes, alcohol and coffee are anxiety-triggers, but I can't seem to find the motivation to quit those things ATM.

I've tried everything for anxiety, meds, therapy, mediation, diet, exercise you name it, and Valium was the only thing that had a noticeable impact but it seems to have made it worse. I've taken it before quite a lot and not had this, usually it just returns to normal. 

I don't know how to make it stop without getting prescribed more. It wasn't even working towards the end anyway and found myself taking a higher dose and then running out faster. (I know I shouldn't do that) 

Is there anything I can do to stop this, or speed up the process of it going back to normal. I would call the doctor but I'm in too much of a state and I'm worried about them thinking I'm just being silly or maybe they will give me more and I don't think I'll control myself. It could all be psychological but it's awful either way ",Anxiety
"I can't get my computer out of my head. This is probably the stupidest thing anybody could be anxious about. Ever since last June, I had a few physical issues with my computer and since then I just keep worried with what could happen later. I know it's just a fairly old computer, and that I'm probably able to afford to replace parts, but the thought of things starting to break just stresses me out a lot. Every suspicious noise, that 90% of the time doesn't even come from the system itself, just drives me into a fit of worry and I hate myself for this.",Anxiety
"Does anyone have experience with lexapro? I am having some very disturbing side effects. I have gone to two doctors about this, and they won't give me a clear answer about when this will go away. 



I was prescribed 10mg lexapro a day, I was taking five a day for about two weeks, when I noticed some tightness in my hamstrings at night.  

By week two it reached a head of being almost unbearable hamstring tightness/pain at night along with flu-like feeling of nausea and joints aching and cracking. I was bedridden for like two days when I decided to stop taking it.  I fucking hate this drug with a passion.  I have stopped for about a week and a half now and the night time weird deep hamstring pain has still been happening and last night even got bad again.



Because of the timing I can't imagine this was anything but the lexapro but I'm barely sleeping and pretty disturbed.  It is such a horrible and strange deep pain it feels like its driving me crazy.  If once person can relate and let me know it would make me feel alot better. I will never take another SSRI again.",Anxiety

"Flight tomorrow and chest pains are preoccupying my mind Hello again all, it is day four of worrying about my chest. Background: I had EKG, CT scan, xray, echo and blood test and the doctors at the ER couldn't find anything.

Since then I have on and off chest pains which come and go, they pass and at the doctors I mentioned it at one point and she didn't seem concern. As some of you may have seen from my other posts, I have been suffering with chest pains over the past few days after worrying about what felt like indigestion. I am very caught up in an anxious loop about it. I woke up in the night disorientated and worried, woke up in the morning crying about whether it was worse or not (it has been same level of discomfort for days, so no)

I have to catch a 12 hour flight tomorrow to go home after the holidays and I am worried that:

- I have missed my chance for urgent medical attention and I am on borrowed time
- My heart is going to have a life or death episode in the plane and I will not surivive
- I am ignoring something that really should be dealt with because I think its anxiety...
- how quickly I can get to a hospital after the flight if needed
- spending twelve hours alone on the plane with the above thoughts looping round and round in my head.

I am constantly pressing my chest to try and analyse the pain. I am focused on it to the point where I cannot focus on anything else. I am aimply monitoring it, taking my pulse, asking myself if it feels worse or not. I didn't want to tell my family or worry them about me heading home tomorrow. I was waiting to feel befter every day but instead I am more and more anxious as this deadline of the flight approaches.

I want to tackle this health anxiety in 2019 as my new years resolution, but right now I cannot see past tomorrow's twelve hour flight. I keep telling myself I had pretty intense tests at the hospital in September and that they would have picked up clots or tears or damage because that's what they were looking for.

Sorry for the multiple posts in the past few days guys. If I can get home after the flight, I will really and seriously go to the doctors and talk to my counsellor about this episode to get help.

I need to pack my suitcase...sorry for the rambling post.",Anxiety

"Anxiety Symptoms 

There a lot of symptoms to anxiety; the ones I get are increased heart rate, odd visual colors, can't stay in a chair (getting the need to stand up). But there's one which I cannot cope and when it hits, game over for me. The feel that reality fades away and everything turns white.



I've never fainted, but when my panic attack is sever I seriously feel like my head is as big as the room and I'm fading away. The amount of fear is unspoken I almost broke my wife's arms while in a car once when  I was holding her. I was TOO afraid to passout (or passaway) and the car might crash and hurt her.

"What are the triggers? Hello everyone. I hope you are having a good and peaceful day.  
Been suffering from something that I can identify as general anxiety disorder. I worry exessively all the time and very often feel angry for no reason at all. I am always afraid that something might go wrong and start imagining future situations which are most likely to make me unhappy. Currently I don't have an opportunity to see a therapist or a professional. I know most of the motives making me feel this way or another, but cannot overcome some of these traumas. I just want to stop being afraid.   
Two things I discovered for myself, or, well, people helped me discover are walking and meditation. This help, but only to a certain extent, not fully.   
I can write endlessly now, but the most important question I want to ask is - what triggers anxiety and constant worry?   
And also, do cigarettes trigger anxiety? I just need to know whether I will start feeling better mentally if I quit or no. Because sometimes the first thing I do when I feel anxious is to light a cigarette. ",Anxiety

"Is this anxiety? - My family &amp; my sons Autism. English is not my first language, sorry about my broken grammar. 

I'm a 38f, married with two young boys - one with mild autism (5yo). Im happy with my marriage, I'm thriving at work and most important, I'm helping my big boy with his development. 

I'm having severe anxiety attacks  when my mom is around or one of my sisters. If I don't share something related to my sons condition - they (mom &amp; sister) tell me that I'm a bad mother, that I'm compromising my sons future and pretty much that everything is doomed cause I don't do or say what they want. 

The point is that I don't know how stop this thoughts at night (reason why I'm writing this) -I can't stop thinking about my sons future and wondering if I'm doing everything possible to help him. My husband tells me that I'm pretty much the best mother my boys can have - we are helping my big boy with every resource available and we are making progress, like big fucking progress.. but i still think is not enough. 

When they are not around life is beautiful, I feel invincible and I do accept my sons condition as part of our daily dynamic - but when family reunions are coming, I start having more and more anxiety cause I know they are going to demand answers and I don't know everything about autism. I know my boy and how to read him and help him, but I don't have a magic wand to touch him and cure him - we are using all our time and money to help him, he's our priority but we still have a 3 yo perfectly normal that demands time, love and attention.

"anxiety from work conversations Let me do the math here:

My manager struggles with self confidence issues and I struggle with extreme anxiety. I already have a hard time talking to people because I tend to not be very good at articulating, but it's especially hard with my boss as she takes everything really badly. I feel like I have to tip toe with my words so communication is very difficult.

Today I was closing with her and another shift supervisor, Evelyn (I am a shift supervisor too) we got on the topic of hiring new people. I've wanted to be a trainer for a very, very long time and have mentioned it to my manager many times. She's told me that she wants to promote me, so I said am I finally going to do my barista trainer training?

She said no... I was going to train Evelyn. (She didn't train me before as I was in uni but now I only have one class)

I was really shocked by this and said but I've been waiting two years for this promotion! Keep in mind Evelyn has only been with the company for a few months.

My manager and I have a very similar outlook in life and a very good relationship. I have told her many times how much I respect her and how I acknowledge how much she's taught me. Anyway, she did feel bad that she hadn't thought of me. I think I might get the promotion over Evelyn, and here's where my anxiety kicks in: I may have just cost one of my friends a promotion.

I'm in bed now kicking myself for saying anything. The only reason I reacted that way was because I was genuinely shocked she wasn't going to promote me, and I tend to say what's on my mind. 

Should I apologize to Evelyn? I really want this promotion and have wanted it for so long, not for the money but because I love teaching people and I think I would excel in this position.

"Any advice for dealing with 'reflexive' anxious feelings? I was seeing a therapist before I moved to a different country for a job. Seeing another therapist isn't an option right now. Most of my anxious feelings revolve around specific social situations, so they don't affect my ability to work very much but trying to make friends or date is pretty tough.

Something I never really got to address with my therapist was how to combat anxious feelings that feel more like a reflex than over-thinking. It's a little hard to explain, so bear with me.

To take a common example, striking up a conversation with a stranger in a purely social setting. It feels rude, and if there's any possibility that they could interpret my actions as romantic or sexual interest, slightly creepy. There's no thought process behind the feeling, just sudden anxiety, as though being rude in this particular way is the same as running into a wall at speed.

I recommend it to any anxious pet owners. Just get a regular security camera (mine is a YI dome camera), you don't need the fancy expensive ones that are made for pet-watching. And I can spy on the cats from work or anywhere else too now! 10/10 would recommend.",Anxiety
"Propranolol Australia question I have only just learned of propranolol, I've been on ssri's for years and now quitting alcohol again which causes me anxiety.  I can get a limited amount of vallium from my doctor but he doesn't give scrip repeats and I only get 30 , 5mg tabs every few months. Would a doctor easily prescribe me propranolol in Australia? Any one from here with any experience getting it from there doctor ?  I get pretty anxious in social situations and at work , I'm hoping this can help and be better alternative to vallium.

"Panic attack sufferers- ever check your blood sugar? I am not a doctor giving any medical advice! I'm simply sharing my story- to see if others have gone through something similar. If you feel it might be- go to your doctor!



For about 10 years (I'm 28) I've suffered from panic attacks. I've been on every medication known to man- I've gone through phases where I was an alcoholic for many years- I've tried many things including diets ect... But then it dawned to me. I tried recalling all times I've had no anxiety- vs. all times I suffered from panic attacks often- and I think I finally came to a conclusion. I have hypoglycemia.



For example- it runs in my family. I was prone to be an alcoholic due to anxiety- but no- it was the sugar my body was seeking. When the alcohol would wear off- major 'panic attacks' would occur. I thought it was due to the sedating effects wearing off- but no- it was low blood sugar spikes. I've been to the ER I don't know how many times thinking I was dying- having a heart attack, stroke or something- but no, it was low blood sugar spikes. And when you go to the ER thinking your having a heart attack, guess what? They do an EKG, chest xray- ect.- but- they don't check blood sugar, now do they? They throw an ativan at you which makes any situation feel better.



When I quit alcohol- I went through withdrawals- the whole nine yards. After recovering- I was eating constantly! And my anxiety was gone- I figured hey- they're right- alcohol causes anxiety- which is right- but- it also balances your blood sugar back to normal if your constantly eating small meals and abstaining from alcohol. When I was growing up- I never had panic attacks- but guess what? I naturally ate small meals through out the day- in other words- a hypoglycemic diet. It all makes too much sense- so I've been testing it- and sure enough- when I have a 'panic attack'- it's because I ate something with too much sugar and hadn't eaten in a while- and eating more sugar- caused the attack to go away. Eating complex carbs, no refined sugar, and many meals through the day completely annihilate my anxiety.



Hypoglycemia has the exact same symptoms of a panic attack- irregular heart beat, fear, shakiness, dizziness, really the list just goes on. Now- I've already been to the doctor to verify this- if you think it's a possible issue- please ask your doctor and dont take my post as medical advice. I also want to share that I'm excited that this whole time it wasn't all in my head- and something really was wrong- but- this is not the case for a lot of people- and I don't want to discourage anyone who suffers from panic attacks and there really is no medical problem causing it. I just felt some people might be going through something like me- and find relief in their anxiety. I've had much health anxiety in the past- and don't want to trigger health anxiety in others- thus- take my story with a grain of salt please.",Anxiety
"Having major Anxiety hey I'm a teen and don't really know what to do having major fucking anxiety and want to curl up into a ball and never come out

some back story

a few weeks ago I was texting a girl who I don't know that well she had one of them Dm to talk things and I love talking to new people so I say why not and start texting her.

anyways we start texting and uk at one point the conversation becomes very stale and I say ""why so dry"" cause uk I like to makes jokes, anyways she responds asking me what she should say and I again jokingly say ask me how I'm so hot like as jokes.

so then the conversation moves on and eventually she leaves me on read no biggie it be like that sometimes.

now some kid in my class who's fucking hates me for reasons I don't even fucking know gets the screen shots of the convo mentioned above and starts sending it to everybody. Let's call him H He even threatens to expose me and shit which I'm like fuck that so I go and tell the school what happened.

Now before people call me a snitch, 1. I sit in a table group with 3 other people including H those 3 other people have been picking on me since the day I arrived for no fucking reason. Like the usual I fuck your mom and shit jokes like fine whatever. but the second you get my Dms and start spreading them around I bascially lost it and told the school.

so the school talks to 2 of them I don't why not the 3rd but whatever and bascially H is not allowed to bring his phone and they apologize to me. They still crack jokes about me snitching and shit but whatever they barely talk to me and honestly that's what I'm happy about.

anyways yesterday I fucking accidentally click yes on some guy's Dm to talk thing and he Dms and I'm like aight I won't be rude I'll strike up a convo he then proceeds to bring up the Dms with me and the girl and says him and H are close like what the fuck. so I block his ass

and now bascially I'm too scared to talk to anybody on Instagram and having mad stress over the fact that these Dms might get sent to everyone I know I'm being paranoid but like I can't help it I don't want to be the laughing stock of the whole school in all honestly why would the girl screen shot it and why would H be such a dick to spread them around, I'll never fucking know.

but right my biggest fear is that when I go back to school which is on Monday everyone will know about this and tease me which again is unlikely to happen since this happened in November but fuck man I'm so scared.

"Which doctors when?? Looking for advice about treatment. I'm feeling a little frustrated/lost/overwhelmed by how sort of fragmented treatment seems to be. We have therapists, for emotional/talk stuff, we have psychiatrists, for meds and brain chemistry stuff, and we have regular old doctors, for body stuff. But that stuff is all so related, it seems impossible for it to be treated as three distinct areas by three different people who don't talk to each other. 

I'm not really sure what I'm asking lol. (new to this subreddit... hi!) I'm just anxious about this. I see a therapist weekly and a psychiatrist every month or two, but I have a lot of physical problems that I think are related to my mental illness (chronic pain, chronic fatigue, stomach problems, etc) and neither of them seem equipped to help with that. Seeing a regular doctor next week, and not sure if I can expect them to help with it either if its a psychiatric issue?? Not to mention I was recently diagnosed with ADHD, which I know can be related to trauma and depression, so I don't know if I need my ADHD and other stuff to be treated as related things and not as separate issues.... I don't know. I'm stressed about figuring out who to go to when and how to get treatment that addresses all this stuff as a whole because I feel like addressing each issue as if its distinct and independent doesn't make sense or won't work or something. 

Does anyone have any words of wisdom about this? (It's possible I'm just being paranoid that treatment will fail if its fragmented in this way. That might be perfectly fine. If that's the case, I just need advice about how to figure out who can help with any given issue.)",Anxiety

"How I can I help my mother? I'm hoping this is the right place to post this! 

My mother (60sF) has always been an anxious person for my whole life but it was never serious enough to warrant a diagnosis in my childhood. About 15 years ago my dad got really sick (details of this are irrelevant) and he had to sell his business. With this came a few medical bills, my dad had been keeping secrets about their financial situation and it turned out they were in a lot more debt than they realized. 

This basically led to my mum's anxiety getting worse, and it has been progressively getting worse since then. She is severely depressed as well. Neither of my parents have worked in the last 15 years and their debt has gotten worse and worse (I'm talking over $300,000). 

My dad just sleeps his life away and my mum is miserable. She won't get herself help because the idea of it makes her too anxious. She spends her days watching TV and feeling miserable, and is only somewhat happy when spending time with my nieces and nephew. When my sisters and I have talked to her about getting free counseling she says there's no point because the wait is too long. 

She tutors English and has one student, but it's only $50 a week and her student is constantly traveling so the job isn't consistent. She has talked for years about needing more students but she is too afraid to put herself out there. I've tried introducing her to exchange students I work with but it doesn't work out. We've suggested she just volunteer to feel like she's contributing in some way but she says she doesn't have time to volunteer because she'd rather work for money... but then her anxiety keeps her from finding a job.

My parents have to sell their house and move somewhere smaller in order to get out of their debt. But she is too anxious to start packing or getting rid of clutter. 

Just this morning she messaged me and said she misses human interaction.  I suggested she take the dog for a walk around the block and she said she didn't want to. 

It breaks my heart that she is living in such misery. All she talks about is how much debt they have, how miserable she is, and she constantly complains about my dad. All this negativity is seriously impacting myself and my sisters but we just don't know what to do. How can you help someone that is too anxious to get help? 

I want her to get counseling because I think a professional will be able to help her through the difficult process of packing up and selling a house. We live in Aus so under Medicare she is entitled to 6 free counseling sessions a year.

If I trusted my gut all the time I would probably never end up doing anything. Sometimes I get weird irrational flighty feelings that I just have to ignore to get through my day. My instinct is to flee because sometimes I will think something will go wrong. 

Or for instance, sometimes I will have this gut feeling that my friends have all stopped caring about me and have turned against me, and if I listen to that feeling, it causes me not to reach out and communicate properly, and I withdraw instead. 

How does the phrase apply to you? Are these gut feelings or would you consider gut feelings to be something else?

Now every time I am around a small child (and thats quite often) and the child cries, my whole body panics and I fixate on how terrified that little boy must've been and I get horrifying scared for any children.   


I know I can't save the world and I know I can't control the actions of bad people in this world, but how can I stop these thoughts from paralyzing me and ruining my mood every time I hear a child cry?",Anxiety
"I feel like I'm honestly at my breaking point and I just need short term ways to cope I was diagnosed with anxiety in September and put on medication which helped for a while, but I feel like the effects aren't good anymore.

"Anxiety in Certain Environments Hi everyone! 

So for a quick background, I've been working on my anxiety in earnest for the last ten months or so (coupled with substantial weight loss and other improvements). For the most part, my anxiety keeps itself at bay.

However, I've found that there is one environment where it consistently starts waking up, and that is at noisy bars during a happy hour. During these, I just shut down and get real quiet and isolated, especially if I'm standing with a group of people who are having conversations.

As far as I can think, this is the only environment where my anxiety really kicks into high gear. Can anyone relate to this, and what is some advice that has helped you cope?

Thanks!",Anxiety
Had a panic attack. Last night I went online and decided to look up medical advances for my chronic illness. I saw that my meds can cause all sorts of life threatening issues and it triggered my anxiety and I had a really bad panic attack. The thought that I'll suffer before dying and that I won't get to see my family as they grow terrifies me. Also losing or seeing someone I love suffering because of a disease terrifies me. I can never enjoy moments because my mind is always thinking about the worst. I just want to Liev life and not worry about the negatives. It ruins so much for me and I just want to be happy. ,Anxiety
"I'm not sure if my problems warrant therapy I read the rules and I'm scared I'll break them, so here's my trigger warning just in case. 

At the start of 2018, I worried a lot about certain things (money, my relationship, etc.), but it never really interfered with my life. But over the past few months I've been finding it harder and harder to get my focus away from irrational worries and fears. I've never even considered the possibility of having an anxiety disorder, but I'm starting to think I do. 

Lately it's gotten to the point where I get these bursts of anxiety and I just cant pin down what's causing them. It's interfering with my work ethic and it's worrying my girlfriend. I'm debating whether I should seek out therapy or not, as I'm a broke college student and I'm scared of the fees.

"Build up of anxiety the past few days I had big problems with depression and anxiety before for a couple of years. I haven't had a breakdown in nearly a year, gave up meds six months ago, felt a bit miserable for a week or two in the summer, and then again in October but it passed and I'd say I've been feeling largely okay since then. There have been stressful episodes at work but those are by and large normal things to deal with.



This week I'm dealing with some anxiety that I can feel building up. It might be the thoughts of returning to a stressful job next week, haven't hit the gym in two weeks, drank a good bit last weekend, overthinking relationships with friends and wondering what they think of me. I also had a bit of an altercation on a night out last weekend where a guy pushed me unprovoked and punched me across the face. I used some basic self defence and got out of the situation without anyone getting hurt. I'm still a bit angry about it when I think of it.



Basically, I just wanted to write this and get it off my chest. I haven't been sleeping or eating right the past week. If anyone has tips on how they keep there defences up, please share them with me.",Anxiety
"So today, my husband started talking to me about some stressful things going on at work. And when he was about through telling me, I just started crying out of nowhere. I can't exactly explain why. I didn't feel like anything he was saying was going to affect our lives in any way. I didn't feel like anything he said was directed towards me. I just went to the room before he could see my tears so I could just breathe. Sometimes I just need a minute alone to get back to normal. My anxiety has been pretty high lately, but that's pretty normal for me in the winter. It was just so weird that I just couldn't hold it in and couldn't understand why I felt so emotional.

"Anxious for exercise, anyone else feel the same? Hey guys, I was wondering if anyone has had the same experience as I did and I was wondering if anyone would like to share it.

When I was younger, I remember I never liked gym because I was very insecure about how I would look while doing the exercise: I was not the most sporty one so I was highly insecure about that. Right up until university I have avoided exercising (like going on a run or to a gym or picking up a sport) but when I enrolled, I thought it would be a great idea to sign up for the rugby team. I liked the team but even though I was motivated, I never truly felt comfortable and confident in myself. I noticed I was having a really hard time mentally and could not get out of my head. I have had several panic attacks during training or when going on a run even though I was not even pushing myself to the limit or did anything remotely like that. My body would just give up on me and I would just go down this horrible place in my head. I want to begin exercising again but every time I think about it I get anxiety and get into my head and tear myself up from the inside out about it (how other people would see me, what they would think, how I would do, how other people do it better). Has anyone maybe had the same experience? And if so: what has helped you through it? I would love to know!

I've a neat mix of anxiety related issues but dissociation is pretty new.

I'm finding it difficult to break these episodes and to move on with my day sometimes. It goes from being pretty okay to relatively severe and when it gets bad, I tend to feel pretty hopeless.

I wake up feeling like I'm watching my life from the outside sometimes: those ones are the worst. Then when that eased, I had a really carefree one where I felt I was playing a video game.

"coming to terms with my anxiety hi, first time poster here. hope it's okay, i just need to vent a little and talk to someone.

my whole life I have suffered from severe anxiety. I mean, as far back as I can remember. I have always thought that it wasn't a big deal though. My mom put me in counseling when I was a kid and I haven't been since. I thought that my anxiety was something everyone felt, in the same amounts as me... really until today.

I am feeling like I really need help. I have always had issues with anxiety and depression, and I have been doing so good through the holidays, setting resolutions... all of sudden tonight while I was cooking dinner I realized that I was beginning to have a panic attack and at that moment I got so itchy. Always thought the itchiness was some skin problem that doctors didn't understand, now I realize it's because of my anxiety.

My chest is still tight, I still can't breathe right, and I'm pretty terrified to have this realization that my anxiety is /this/ intense.

"24 weeks pregnant and I need help Long time lurker, first time poster due to personal insecurities. Bear with me, as I have a really hard time talking about my struggle with anxiety. I appreciate anyone who reads this. I could use some tips for managing my anxiety, which has gotten exponentially worse since I became pregnant. I use to take 1mg Klonopin on almost a daily basis, but that's a no go for this developing human being inside my belly. It's been extremely difficult trying to adjust to not taking Klonopin, and while I'm embarrassed to say it, I realize how dependent I became now that I am no longer taking it. My anxiety is WORSE than BEFORE I even started taking it. I feel shaky, on edge, and just all around uncomfortable all of the time. I still take an SSRI, and my OB prescribed me Buspar, which seems to do nothing. 

Each day feels like a new mountain to climb, even though rationally my life shouldn't be as hard as I'm making it. I have trouble getting out of bed sometimes, and I'm struggling with work. I recently changed jobs and am not making nearly as much money as I use to (I'm a therapist, ironically). My husband has been supporting us the past couple months but this is not sustainable. 

Also, being pregnant totally sucks physically and emotionally. I already feel paralyzed by my anxiety and being pregnant just makes me feel even more useless. While I am excited about meeting my daughter, I'm terrified at the thought that I won't be able to provide for her, or that I won't be able to handle the stress of parenthood. It all feels like too much sometimes and I don't know what to do with all of these uneasy feelings.

Onwards: Two weeks ago I started taking Citralopram as prescribed by my PCP. The side effects after two doses were so debilitating that I had to stop. My PCP gave me a hard time about stopping after two doses and today insisted that I either give Citralopram a second chance or try something new. When I said I prefer to start any new medication after my talk therapy starts (Jan 18th) my PCP said that I need to get a medication NOW to support my anxiety/depression. She said the wait between starting talk therapy and its effectiveness will be too long. She says she doesn't want to push medication on me but that I need it right now. She prescribed Venlafaxine ER but I really don't want to start it. I'm honestly more anxious after the bad experience with Citralopram and I don't feel like my PCP knows me well enough to start prescribing medications with long term effects and intense withdrawals.

"Aced a phone interview and I CAN'T STOP SMILING. PHONE ANXIETY SUCKS Three years ago you would've never seen me pick up a phone. And in the rare moments I did, I'd either pass the phone to my family, or I'd be a stuttering mess and end the phone call hating everything about the call. I'd blank out on the simplest questions, or overthink every second of silence. It would be a never ending cycle of me flinching whenever my phone rang. 

And then I got to a point where I got tired of it. I was entering university and I couldn't even make a phone call for myself without my anxiety getting the best of me. 

So then I asked my friends and family to help. I took it step by step, and just called them for a few seconds. They'd be there to help me calm myself down enough to be able to think. And then once I started gaining just a little bit of confidence, I pushed myself to make calls to other people. Sure I had to write scripts for every call, and anticipate replies so I could keep writing scripts accordingly, but nonetheless it got me out there. I started making calls. From booking doctors appointments to just calling to ask about food at a restaurant, I did it, and the pride I felt every time after the call was unexplainable. I still had those thoughts though, of the things I could've said better, the ways I could've changed my tone. But ultimately I reminded myself after each phone call about what I conquered. 

I just hung up a phone call today, from a scheduled phone interview. I didn't write a script for it. Instead, I just did everything I would do for a usual job interview, preparing and researching as best I could. And then I just answered the phone call and had a conversation. At points my voice was shaky, but I know I have yet to grow. I ended up getting another interview - in person! Which, to me, is so much easier than the phone, so I'm hopeful it goes well. 

I understand how immobilizing phone anxiety can be, but I swear to you with practice and the right support it really can get better. If anyone ever needs, I'm here to offer calling practice lol, just because it has helped me so much.

Like 2 days ago to make the story short I bought a hoody in a roots store and completely forgot my debit card at the counter when I walked out the store. Luckily the cashier found me 2 mins afterwards leaving the store and returned the card to me. After I went home that day my head was going crazy, was thinking all over the place like what if someone took a photo of my card number and how dumb I was to do such a thing. Or how the card that was given back was a fake But in reality none of that happened as my bank statement was still clean after 2 days. I was probably to tired and my brain farted because I stayed at a mall for more then 5 hours that day 

Also times where I'm sick I start googling the syntomps. And overthink how my sickness is getting worse.

I am 22 and have been working short odd jobs/internships since I was 17 as I have never been able to finish school. I have tried my best every single time and was not sure why it never worked out, but every failing moment made my fear of going to school deeper and right now I'm in a mental state where setting a foot inside a school building gives me anxiety attacks.

I had accepted that I was to work short term minimum wage jobs for the rest of my life but that has also deepened my anxiety over time as I never feel safe nor have any normal routines. I eventually got stuck in a spiral where different internships told me I had potential and a lot of work ethic but not any education for me to stay with any of the companies. It sounds ridiculous but instead of encouraging me to educate myself it put in a very bad place mentally and I grew too afraid to apply for any jobs at all. It is hard to explain but it is very similar to the fear I have of going to school.

Deciding I'd give life one last go I made an attempt at job hunting and started a 6 month internship. I've been there for three months and as before I have been told I have potential and a great work ethic but sadly no education. However, the boss is incredibly sweet and made an unbelievably kind offer to combine the remaining 3 months with studies. I happily agreed and made a visit to a few schools.

The visits were horrible and they all ended in panic attacks. I did apply though and was accepted to a course that will start in a few weeks. While this is great, I just can't function. Whenever it is mentioned I freak out real bad and I'm not sure how I'll be able to physically attend class when I can't even talk about it without breaking down.

Anyways, ever since I had my daughter 7yrs ago(Im 29), my anxiety has progressively became worse as time goes on. Every year I'm back at the doctor because of my anxiety, and I feel like he doesn't take me seriously, all he does is just raise the mg of Paxil I'm on(up to 30mg after 3yrs of being on it). I feel like nobody understands. I'm terrified to leave the house, I'd much rather be in the safety of my room.

I can't eat, I can't sleep even though I'm exhausted all the time. My daughter deserves so much better.

How can I make my doctor understand the severity of my anxiety?? I've tried telling these things to him before but of course he only raised my dose. I am not prescribed any benzodiazepines for the onset of attacks, he refuses to.

"Working in a city, I've been able to reduce my anxiety by carrying a self defense item. I'm not sure I'm alone here, but traveling to and from my job makes me incredibly nervous. 

I have to ride public transit, which, when you put a volatile individual who's had a bad day into an enclosed car, can yield nerve wracking results. For this, I've always sat on an end seat, don't wear headphones, and make sure I am seated somewhere where I can observe the entire train. I have come up with plans of action in my head in case anything ever goes wrong, and keep a keen eye on my surroundings to see if myself or anyone else is in danger. 

I then have to walk half a mile to get to my building in a city where the police are usually pre-occupied with crime that's already occurring, rather than surveilling the streets during busy hours. Usually when something goes wrong (someone threatening people or doing something illegal), the perpetrator has already disappeared by the time the police get there. I try to do the same things to alleviate stress in this environment; no headphones, pay extreme attention to my surroundings, walk behind large groups of people rather than among them, etc. 

This hasn't resolved my anxiety though, as anyone wishing to do harm still can. I may be better prepared for it, but I still would have trouble stopping anything if it came to that. Well recently I started carrying a self defense item (it's not a gun), and just by knowing it's in my pocket and touching it periodically, I know I'm better equipped to deal with a bad situation if it ever arises. Sure, I wouldn't be able to stop someone from running me over or shooting up the area, but there are countless robberies, assaults, and other violent crimes that happen in cities on a yearly basis.

"Anxious about being sick and off from work Anyone else get anxious being off from work despite being legitimately sick?

I went to the doctor and received a doctor's note excusing me from work, but despite that I feel so anxious at night knowing that I'm not at work that I can't sleep.  It's like I'm imagining what my co-workers are saying and how me being conveniently sick after the long break lowers my stock in the company or something.

It almost makes me anxious to go back to work.",Anxiety

"Nervous to ask for an ESA So I took a teaching job 4 hours from home (which for me is pretty far.) My first semester, I was so busy with teaching and coaching one act I had no time nor energy to socialize. Once one act season ended, I have been slowly but surely trying to get out more. However the town I live in is extremely small, like 800 people, so there's hardly any sort of volunteer opportunities. I've tried reaching out to coworkers, but they are all married and/or with kids and busy. 

My landlady is extremely nice, but the Tennant before me  had a cat that torn the place to hell now there's a no pets policy. She did say I could have a reptile or bird and I did get a fish, but it's not the same. A repitle or bird would be too high maintenance for me to care for, a cat would probably be the best for me. I know that b/c of my ADHD and anxiety I could probably qualify for an ESA, but I feel like it wouldn't be fair to my landlady. She's very good to me, and I don't want to look like ""that person"". I do have an appointment to speak with a doctor here so on, but I just wanted to to get some other opinions as well.

I'm 16 and since I was around 11 I've been constantly living with strong worry over the littlest things and my heart beats fast over the littlest things and sometimes i don't even know why I'm anxious. I feel constantly sick and don't want to eat unless I'm calm and comfortable and I don't like meeting now people blah blah blah. I also get nervous in social interactions which I have been told is just shy. I've never told anyone about it but it's just getting worse and worse. I'm not looking to claim I have anxiety because people with real anxiety probably get it much worse like can't leave their bed or talk and things. How do I stop feeling very anxious?

I have also had waves of depressive periods and feel helpless and worthless which I think is just linked to the whole overwhelming overthinking or something but I have been really down for certain periods then not as bad then sink back into it.

I am always seeking approval from friend group and feel like everyone talks behind my back and I feel like shit if I accidentally say the smallest wrong thing to anyone or they don't reply as I expected or speak to me the tiniest bit different as I feel like they view me different or don't like me. I think about every little thing for days and it all just builds up and gets overwhelming 

I'm quite popular which is confusing I don't understand  why I feel like this when I was capable of making loads and loads of friends in school in the past??.

"On the verge of a breakdown because my car reset the seat position memory So some background - I've been diagnosed with general anxiety, with OCD tendencies. I have a big trigger with the position of things. For instance, if someone rearranged furniture to vacuum and it's not in the same place, it feels as everything in the room is off. I start having that claustrophobic feeling of being closed in a tighter and tighter box, and I feel like an out-of-body experience. 

The position of the driver's seat in my car is another big trigger of mine. My first car didn't have seat memory, so whenever I'd take it into the shop or something, I'd outline my seat alignment with painters tape so I'd know exactly how to put it back in the right place. When I got a new car, I specifically made sure it had seat memory. 
Anyways, after hours I finally found a seat position I liked in this new car and I programmed it in. This has released such a huge stressor for me. However, the other night my car battery died. A friend helped start it, and they moved the seat to reach the lever to open my hood. I figured - no problem, it's programmed in,  but after jump starting my car, it didn't reset. I thought it was just because jump starting it may have put the car in a weird mode and it would work when I started it on my own. 

Anyways, I start my car this morning, and the seat memory didn't return. I feel my chest tightening and that claustrophobic feeling begin again. I sit there trying to readjust the seat to how I like it for nearly 45 minutes and nothing feels right. I'm currently inside trying not to hyperventilate and feeling like my world is crashing in on me, all because my freaking seat is out of its position.  To top it off, I'm visiting my parents from the holidays and they are very strong in  the mental health isn't real camp. And so they're just sitting here laughing, and imitating me. 

Anyways - just any advice, or thoughts would really be appreciated.  I literally just feel as if I'm going to die from this anxiety. ",Anxiety
"Getting worse as I get older I turned 22 recently and I've noticed in the past year or so going out to run errands or just going out in general has gotten extremely hard. It's like I have to give myself multiple pep talks in my head and remind myself it's just the grocery store, or the mall, etc. I just feel like everywhere I go people are watching me and judging. It's such a stupid mind set to have because obviously I know that's not the case and I'm not important enough to have that problem so why can't I shake it? 

I figured it has to do with my lack of confidence as well but I've always been self conscious and I was able to go out and not really care. I'm just not sure why this seems to be getting worse and not better for me. I still force myself to go out and get things done but it's just a constant battle in my head the whole time and it actually causes me to mess up more and be forgetful. 

I guess what I'm asking is just for any tips or advice anybody has for dealing with this. I don't want to not be able to leave my house or not feel comfortable in my own skin like this. I've been prescribed Xanax but I only take that during my anxiety attacks or panic attacks and when I truly can't calm down anymore.

"Not health anxiety, but anxiety from poor health Hey guys, I see so many posts about dealing with health anxiety and worries about potential health problems. I sometimes have this issue, but a bigger problem for me is that my anxiety is elevated when my actual health problems flare up. I have moderate scoliosis which causes back spasms and tingling in my leg - sometimes, the pain is very very bad and disrupts sleep and daily routine. Additionally, I have pretty bad acid reflux that causes a constant lump in my throat, coughing, stomach pain, heartburn, mild nausea. I also have some issues with my corneas, which dry and scar easily causing burning and blurred vision. Sometimes, I'm fine. Most of the time, one or more of these issues are flaring up. 

Long story short, I have a decent number of chronic health problems that interfere enough to impact my day almost constantly. I don't know how to stay positive and deal with this - I find myself panicking over feeling bad forever, which is difficult because I don't really have a strong argument against it; I usually DO feel bad. I'm only 30. 

Can anyone relate? I feel so whiny sometimes. I'm not dying. I'm just really uncomfortable a lot of the time and I feel like it makes me a worse version of myself. I try to work out when I'm feeling up to it, eat well, and do a lot of self care but it feels like an uphill battle.

I would get debilitating adrenaline rushes from getting in minor arguments in high school.

"Guilty for feeling happy and feeling like something bad will happen I've always been anxious but lately I have been feeling on edge. As a result my OCD has got slightly worse (everything has to be perfect).

My anxiety worsened last year. I have been studying a masters degree (nearly finished now) and I had a few troubles. One of the office staff was generally unpleasant (she is leaving next week thank god) and also one of the module leaders was a jerk who gave me a really bad mark (I appealed this with mitigating circumstances and it's still ongoing). Basically I felt like people were ""out to get me"". My anxiety got so bad that I got very angry and I was worried at one point that I was going to physically hurt one of them in retaliation. I didn't hurt anyone, but I did phone the office woman up at one point to put her straight after she accused me of something. I should have quit the course but I wanted to keep my scholarship money that I worked hard for. Anyway it's nearly over now.

My grandparents also went into care last year as they have dementia (my grandad is now on an end of life plan). That made me feel uneasy and it also caused a lot of unrest at home as my parents had to get power of attorney and sort out the finances. There were lots of problems so my parents were stressed.

I have turned a corner in the past month or so. I have cut out a few things that were causing me problems and I have also adopted a new attitude. I do not take any nonsense anymore. In the past I would do things that I didn't really want to do, like applying for jobs I wasn't really interested in. I also only did my masters course because they offered me money; I don't want to work in the sector once I finish. Now I have decided to only do what makes me happy. I am 30 and I think this change has come about due to experence (one you experience crap for so long you no longer put up with it). I feel a bit better but like the title says, I feel a bit on edge and like if I'm happy something bad might happen.

This is obviously a toxic way to think and (I think) I deserve to be happy, or at least have a normal life like others... the question is how can I stop feeling this way? I am booked in for therapy this month and I also take 5HTP, but I don't know what else to do. Take the SSRI route again? I thought about applying for retail work to get out there and socialise to take my mind off things, but I am anxious about facing the public in a work environment.

I'm gonna list some of the things here, and I know people here aren't doctors, but please just tell me if I'm not being an idiot, and if it's worth going over.

when someone talks to me:
? I start shaking, pretty badly
? my mind goes blank (someone said to me at work ""is _____ not in today"" and I didn't know what to say even though a simple no was all it took.)
? I can't seem to speak loudly, no matter how hard I try
? even though I'm desperate to talk to people, I'll try to end the conversation as quickly as possible without realising what I'm doing.
? after every conversation I have the ""I should have said ""_____"" instead"" or ""I used the wrong tone they will misunderstand (I'm terrified of misunderstandings lol)

also:
? I never start a conversation
? randomly I will get shaky/on edge for no reason (had to finish work early because of it before)

it's not that I don't want to talk to people, if I said everything I wanted to say when I wanted to say it, I think I'd be one of the more talkative people

"How to get better? Hi everyone,

So I've struggled with mental illness for almost all of my life.  

During the past six years things have gotten dramatically worse. I was diagnosed with severe social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder and moderate depression. I've wanted to get better since then but ive been struggling   With consistency and perseverance. All I wanna do is avoid the reality of life and how far away I am from being normal. I do this through shopping, tv, or just doing anything that doesn't make me think about my issues. Every time I try to do therapy, I feel extremely unmotivated, sad and just can't focus for shit.  I'm just extremely tried and sad most of the time. 

In addition, I haven't had the best experiences with therapists.i've seen a couple throughout the years and honestly they barely helped me at all. They didn't  even seem to care or take me seriously. And For some reason, exposure isn't working as good as it should for me.  despite how many times I try to gradually face my fears I'm still the same. In regards with cognitive restructuring, I have no idea how to do it. I don't know where to start, how to do it right or anything like that. How am I supposed to think straight and change my thoughts? 

I'm just so tired of life and the way I live it. I'm not living  guys, I'm just rotting.

I went to my cousins bed (he gave me his bed and slept in his sisters bed which is in the same room) at around 22:30 as I was extremely tired because it was a long drive down and for once, I got to sleep pretty fast. 

I stayed asleep until around 04:20ish, that's when I woke up and started having a panic attack. I'm not exactly sure why it started, but it did. Anyways, when I have panic attacks, I shake like crazy and it doesn't calm down until I start reducing my heart rate. 

The problem with me shaking was that I wasn't sure if my cousin was still awake or not, and since I was shaking so much, it sounded a lot like I was masturbating which made me even more anxious because if he was awake, he would've been thinking like wtf is he doing in my bed. I couldn't even try to slow my breathing because if I started deep breathing, it would've made it sound even worse so I just lay there shaking and I couldn't think of what to do other than grab my phone and sit up so if he looked over, it wouldn't look too bad but I still couldn't stop shaking so I decided to go downstairs and get some water. 

When I got downstairs, the shaking calmed but it was still there. After I finished filling my glass, I went back up and got back into bed and went on my phone. Then I started thinking about what just happened, and that got the shakes going again so basically the whole cycle repeated itself until I put my headphones in and listened to some music which finally calmed me down.

I managed to go to sleep by 5:30 and when I woke up in the morning, my cousin didn't say anything so hopefully he was asleep.

Sorry for such a long post, and thanks for reading it if you did. 

TL;DR

Basically I had a panic attack in my cousins bed and didn't know if he was awake or not and I had extreme shakes so it sounded like I was masturbating which made everything worse. In the morning he didn't say anything so hopefully he was asleep.",Anxiety
"Ways to calm chronic severe anxiety attacks? Lately I've been getting regular anxiety attacks around the same time every day on and off... also when the attack is over, I still have that knot in my stomach that won't fully go away and it's making me have no appetite and nauseous all the time.

Last night I got high with a guy I'm seeing and immediately felt like I had to puke... I also had to ask him to leave because i was feeling so shit. 

Then I got anxiety about asking him to leave etc hahaha it's a vicious cycle and at this point, my heart literally feels sore as f?*?.

"Does anyone have anxiety at night from a constant fear of home invasion/burglary? Hello all, long time lurker, first time poster.

I've always had intense anxiety at night time stemming from a fear of someone coming in to my house. It's always been ""manageable"" up until SOMEONE ACTUALLY DID BREAK IN. 

Luckily for me my phobia actually woke me up the second he opened the gate (I think my brain had prepared me for it), which meant I was able to call the police in time for him to be arrested. It was a very traumatic experience because of my existing fear, the fact the police required that I keep talking to them which made me feel like I would be heard by him (he knew I was there - I heard him react to the sounds I was making), and worse of all I heard him slowly come up the stairs (where I was) and try and open my bedroom door while I was holding it shut.

Ever since then, like clockwork at midnight, if I'm not asleep, I will lie in bed listening for any noise. If I hear anything, my brain will actually convince me it's someone breaking in, even if it's just my dog farting, and I become paralyzed by fear. Sometimes, my brain even tricks me into actually hearing the creaking stairs that I heard when the guy came up the stairs, even though I live in a different house that doesnt creak. My mind is actually making up sounds. Occasionally I will sometimes get sleep paralysis where I'll wake up but not be able to move and am already in a state of fear/anxiety.

Am I going insane? Does anyone else have this anxiety? Do you have any tips or advice to cope? Financially, I am not in a place where I can afford a therapist. Does it sound like I need to see one?",Anxiety

"Extreme anxiety from feeling ""stuck"" Super condensed version: I graduated college, got a job offer in an industry I'm not in love with that I took. Now I feel incredibly stuck in a job that's a terrible fit because I need the money and benefits. The job offers no structure or feedback and I honestly feel like I am not qualified to do the job with the education I got. Now I dread going to work and have daily anxiety attacks. I live with my boyfriend who is incredibly supportive but I feel like I'm really not fun to be around anymore with how stressed and anxious I am. I literally have no one else to go to. 

I don't know what to do. I go to work, come home, and worry about having to go to work the next day. I'm looking into finding a therapist but I honestly have no idea where to go from here. I just need support or advice or something. I just can't keep it in anymore.

"Is it my anxiety or just me? (34/F) I've most likely had anxiety my whole life, now that I look back on it. But lately I feel that people are just ignoring me and speaking over me whenever I'm talking.

"Diagnosed/bridge burned for the better Got diagnosed with anxiety this week. I'm struggling primarily with a disconnect between my mind and heart- like, I'll know something is true intellectually, but I'll feel something that isn't really true and it will be very hard to get rid of it. Which I guess most people on here experience!
Like, for example, I lost a friend a couple months back. I have no problem losing them, they didn't really add any value to my life if I'm being blunt. I analyzed the situation, talked to others, and I know it wasn't my fault. They have a lot of immaturity to work through, coming from a small town and sheltered family in early college. Basically just a completely irrational person. I know this to be true, and I know the friendship didn't fold because of something I did. But, I still have constant worry that they could do something to harm me in the future, or I really DID do something wrong, you name it. Even though I know others who went through the same thing as me with them... it's just a false fear that I can't exactly place and just want to be gone. Every time I see them, I'm reminded of the fact that they ask and could play a negative role in my future... even though we aren't in the same field, and they have burned far more bridges than me. So, it should be ridiculous to believe that they could actually hurt me. But the irrational worry is still there. Anyone have experience with this?",Anxiety
"Work Anxiety I want to start off by saying that I hope this doesn't sound like I am moaning, but if it does please tell me. I have suffered from mild anxiety my whole life, but recent events at work have caused it to become debilitating at times.

So up until my manager and one other colleague resigned I quite enjoyed my software developer job. I'd be assigned tasks and id thrive on solving problems and learning along the way and just working on jobs that I was given. My opinion was valued and my manager would consult me before making decisions. I felt like I was quite smart and good at my job.

So my manager left at the beginning of December, and my other colleague left at the end of October. I was promoted to fill my managers role with a nice pay rise, to lead the team etc..., all positive stuff in theory. However I have found there is no real direction for my team from upper management or the business anymore. I wake up feeling sick and anxious. I feel sick and anxious when I have to make decisions. When someone asks me to do some work I feel scared and like I just don't want to anymore. I feel like everything (even small things) become overwhelming. I am a 29 year old man and I sometimes feel like crying at work. I feel that I'm not adequate for the role. I'd much rather be typing out this post.

I'm certain that I want to leave my job for something else with less responsibilities, so I can just focus solving problems one task at a time as I used too while learning along the way. However, I have been thinking recently, do I hate my job or do I just not want to work anymore. I've also started to think ""Am I just lazy?"". I can't answer this but I'm certain my anxiety is caused by my job situation.

I have been receiving therapy (CBT over the phone) over the last couple of months but I'm not sure this helps. The past couple of months have been really dark for me, I've even started looking into spiritual things, horoscopes and numerology for re-assurance that things are going to be OK. I even pray for guidance before bed. Anxiety has changed me...

Again I apologise if it sounds like I am moaning, the past couple of months have been really dark for me and I felt like I need to write this out somewhere. Has anyone else experienced something like this?

"Lower your Expectations What do you expect from yourself ? What do people expect from you ? What does society expects from you?

Don't we live our lives with this need - some kind of fabricated subsconcious need that we must archieve certain expectations ?

What  if we do not have expectations ?  Would our lives be better ? Would we  end as bums on the streets ? Would  be more serene and at peace?

If  you go to a party and you are sure the  event will be amazing. Most of  the time you are going to be  disappointed. You have raised the bar too  high, way too high. What if  instead of that you were to santo yourself.  Whatever happens Im going to  try to enjoy myself. And you do enjoy the  moment.

See the difference ? Lowering  your  expectations does not mean that you are not doing your best. It  does not  mean you are doing nothing. Lowering your expectations may  seem  counter-intuitive but its not.  When you lowering your  expectations. You tend to exceed  them and by always exceeding them you  end up doing much better and be  much happier. Every time you aim to high  and fall flat you are giving  your mind a negative nudge.

"I have issues going to work. Is it anxiety or laziness? I have been in the same ongoing cycle ever since I started working in my first job at 15. I'm now 31. It always starts with me somehow getting an amazing job. I swear to myself I am going to succeed at the job and never miss a day, never take time off unless I'm really unwell, never be late etc. Usually the first few weeks to months I'm pretty good. Then it starts getting harder and harder to get up in the morning. Then one morning I can't get up at all. Then later down the track it becomes two mornings I can't get up at all... followed by a whole week. 

Meanwhile my boss, who is usually always very understanding in the beginning, starts becoming less and less empathetic. Oh, I'll be honest, I've lied to them. I tell them I'm sick with the flu, food poisoning, migraines, car trouble, sick cat, sick boyfriend, period pain... they know I'm lying and I know they know. With my last job I tried to be honest about my anxiety from the start. I asked for amended working arrangements, but I was denied. That was the start of everything going down hill.

Then I get pulled in to meetings with confused and frustrated managers who usually say things like ""You produce good work and work so hard when you're here... you're just never here"" and ""You have so much potential"". I apologies, I beat myself up, kick myself hard and swear to myself again that I'll change everything.

I always... ALWAYS... end up getting fired. Then I beat myself up more. What's wrong with me? Why can't I just GO to work!? It's so easy for everyone else. Even people with anxiety and depression seem to just be able to go to work every day, or at least most days. They're ambitious and successful. They make money and pay their bills. Meanwhile my amazing boyfriend has to support me while I feel like I use him because I'm just a piece of shit that can't go to work for no good reason? I convince myself I don't care and even say it out loud. But I do. I care so much.

What does it feel like on the days I can't go? I feel tired. Beyond exhaustion tired. I feel sad and stressed for no good reason. I feel irritable and worried. I feel like everyone hates me and I'm failing in every area of my life. I feel like I'm just a lazy loser. Those are the days my boyfriend cheers me up and we usually end up having a great day. He's always pissed off with me for having the day off though.
 Sometimes I just think I have so much other stuff in my life to do that I can justify having the day off to do everything else so I feel less overwhelmed. Those are the days I usually end up sleeping all day.

I've tried googling it to see if any one else with anxiety feels this way. Nothing seems to come up.

After I loose another job I'm back in the same position. I have no references, no job prospects, my resume is full of short term jobs. I have no skills and never finished school because study and school makes me more anxious than work. 

I don't know how I always land on my feet with a well paying job. But this time, I think my luck has run out. It's January and I have no job after being fired just before Christmas. I have no references. I have so much debt and bills. I have no idea what to do.

"My day so far.. Its only 1pm. Okay, so, today i had a panic attack. Over something as simple as a camera being aimed in my direction. I am also incredibly ashamed of it. While there is a reason behind it, it looks fucking stupid freaking out about a camera. I wasn't going to say anything but I am, because I've come home, and thought about it. Why should it matter what i have a panic attack over? Why do i always feel so ashamed over something you shouldn't ever feel ashamed about? What's that all about? Why the hell do people do this for attention? Because i sure as hell dont want attention while im struggling to breath, going fucking purple and making a fool of myself. I dont understand it.

"Can someone help me out? I've never dealt with this before. I don't really know how to classify this problem I've been having, I can't tell if this is just anxiety or something more because I haven't had this happen to me before and I haven't really had anxiety to know if that's what this is.

So, these ?attacks' I've been having started after seeing my Grandpa. He's got Dementia and the beginning stages of Alzheimer's. I hadn't talked to him a lot or been to see him at all in a year before I visited him this thanksgiving (he lives out of state) and seeing him genuinely messed me up. I don't know how to explain it, he's not all the way gone but the cracks in his reality are starting to show in big ways, and a huge part of me, as selfish as it sounds, worries it's gonna happen to me eventually. The thought of that sends me into a spiral that's hard to come out of. I will think I see something out of the corner of my eye like I normally would before but now my brain will immediately think of him, and how he looks/ acts now and how that could be me one day. I can shake it off but random thoughts come into my head and I can't seem to stop them from reoccurring.

I just feel like it's important to say that because my ?attacks' have only happened after seeing him and I feel like they are in some way a build up of the reoccurring bad thoughts I'll have because of the thought of him. (I know I may sound like a bad person as it's not his fault he's going through this and I love him with all of my heart but I genuinely can't help the way I feel, I feel horrible for even feeling this way and having these thoughts.) 

The attacks will happen at random but something small always triggers them. For example, I'll lay in one position for too long and my arm or leg will start to go to sleep. I'll have a simple thought like what if this tingling only gets worse and before I can rationalize that I'm okay or even react myself, my body will react in the worst possible way, to the point that I'm convinced something has to be wrong because of the way my body is reacting. It's like I loose the ability to control anything regarding how my body feels and it acts on its own. It's like I'm having a conversation with my body trying to calm it down but my body is telling me It feels like there's definitely something wrong. It feels like I'm going to die and something going on with my body will make me die at any second. I don't know how to explain it properly because it feels so surreal when it happens, but the best example is that it feels like, within a fraction of a second, someone else is coming into my body and controlling all emotions and rationalizing for me and all I can do is deal with it. I'll tell myself I'm okay and that nothings wrong but my body will genuinely feel like there's something I need to get ready for, like something horrible is getting ready to happen. My feet will feel cold, my head will start to feel flushed and I get dizzy, all because of a simple what if thought that I'm not worried about anymore because I'm worried about how my body is reacting over everything. Then once it feels like I'm about to pass out because of how intense the experience is, the emotions start, it feels like every ?on and off' switch for every emotion I could have is being flipped on and off repeatedly. It literally burns, and feels like I'm a battery being drained to 0% and charged to 100% within a few seconds over and over, or like I'm a pilot who's only ever flown in auto pilot and then in the blink of an eye, while flying, I have to know what everything does and how to fly a plane I've never learned to fly. All I can do is cry when this happens and try to call my mom or brother who think I'm crazy trying to explain why I'm crying and shaking but talking semi normally and responsively. It's out of my control. I've never experienced anything like it before. I normally completely stop worrying about my body at this point, because whatever made my body freak out moved to my emotions, and I just try to manage the emotions because the emotions are worse than the initial attack. Then just as quickly as it all came, it's over. I feel like I'm in control again, of my emotions, rationality and body. I normally just scream into my pillow after this and calm down knowing it's over but cry thinking about it happening again. This will all happen in about 5 minutes. 

This is hard for me to share and if you made it this far I really appreciate it, I never thought I'd have to reach out for help about my mental health and it's really scary to do so. I've only had this happen 3 times since thanksgiving but each time is just as bad. If you know what this is, even if it's just anxiety, or maybe you deal with it as well, any response will help me feel better and not so alone. ",Anxiety
"Therapist switch? Other advice-- I've already posted this exact thing on r/AnxietyDepression I am just desperate for anyones advice so I'm copy-pasting it here. I posted there first because it's smaller.



My therapist doesn't specialize in anxiety or depression, he specializes in marriage counseling. I can tell. All he wants to direct conversation towards during sessions is my new boyfriend. I dropped out of school to work and to address my issues with anxiety, depression, and ADD, *not to talk about when Bob thinks my boyfriend of 2 months will want to have kids*. I don't even want kids. He never even asked. UGH. 



The school I dropped out of wants some sort of letter to confirm that there was a valid reason for my dropping out, so that I don't have to pay them for the month I was there. Bob wrote me one and faxed it over. So I have a letter from a real therapist, but I've only seen him about 10 times and I am dissatisfied with the letter. I don't know how this works, but what if the letter doesn't provide enough support for my case? He didn't mention my diagnosed depression or ADD in the letter, but he did mention the wrong medication. (I've switched from buspar to xanax, he mentioned buspar.)



Should I go back to see the old therapist, to ask for a letter revision, or is the inaccurate letter enough? Should I get a letter from my primary care doctor instead/in addition? I found a therapist close by who does specialize in anxiety (I intend to switch once I get the nerve to call), can I get a letter from him first visit?



Should I see if I can get him to focus on anxiety? Does he even know how to address anxiety? I am starting to doubt that he does, last time I went I said that I was probably going to apply for this job I've been wanting, but have been afraid to apply for, and he said ""at this point, I have no confidence that you'll apply for that. None at all."" Now I also have zero confidence that I'll apply, thanks.

"Heartbeat at night causing distress Hey folks,

So around a month-ish ago I had my worst panic attack ever. The following 2 weeks I had panic attacks every day. It then started to calm down but I have been obsessively checking my pulse several times a day (more like multiple times every 10 minutes) this entire time since then.

I ordered CBD cartridges in hopes it would help since weed actually is making the issue worse now. CBD seems to help tremendously by preventing an oncoming attack, assuming I can predict it. (went to the doc's after my bad panic attack, he said it was just panic and referred me to psych again. psych took a total of two weeks to call me, then I asked to see psychiatrist and there is no longer a psychiatrist within 20 miles of me.... wtf am I paying for kaiser?)

It's awful. I used to be able to sleep on my side, it was my favorite. I feel like a prisoner to my pulse. I can feel it when I'm standing, walking, listening through headphones. I can hear it when I'm trying to sleep, which is why I'm posting this thread.

"To anxious to actually function. That's...yeah. That's it, in a title.



I'm anxious about everything: driving, health, work, relationships...the list goes on. I've dealt with generalized anxiety to some degree throughout my life, but in the last year, it's gotten so bad that I can't live anymore. There's no one specific cause I can pin down: I wasn't in any accidents, I haven't suffered from any kind of illness or injury, and hell, I even left an extremely stressful job. I should, by all rights, be doing *better,* but I'm not. Every little thing I face in my day to day causes me to completely shut down. Sometimes I just can't breathe, other times I completely space out and lose chunks of time. On some days, it's so bad that I genuinely believe I'm completely losing touch with reality and going insane. I've read about people in the early stages of the onset of schizophrenia experiencing similar things, after all, and for most people, it starts around my age. (See the bit about health anxiety.)

"Never really talked about this online but thought I'd give it a shot. (Story) I just want to start my story off by saying that before the night I mentioned I had never had a history of anxiety or at least not prolonged anxiety.

The day was Aug 10, 2016 the day before my birthday and I invited my friends over to play video games and hang out. One of my friends had to leave later on, the rest of my friends were spending the night. I remember the night very vividly because this night changed my life entirely. I bought a 12 pack of Blue Red bull on amazon and it got delivered the night they came over and I drank probably 3-4 of them my two other friends drank about the same amount. Anyways I drank the red bulls and at first I didn't felt the normal effects of Red Bull (i.e jitteryness, wide awake, etc.) but then about 2 hours after consumer the red bulls I started to feel anxious while playing a board game. And eventually it started to turn into a serious anxiety issue, and I was starting to get scared that I might have a heart attack or something. It only seemed to get worse and worse and eventually I was literally crying because I thought I was experiencing my last moments alive. Anyways, I eventually fell asleep and woke up feeling different but I woke up with little sleep as in like maybe 4-5 hours. Afterwards I started feeling just a broad anxiousness. My heart rate was threw the roof and I was scared for my life. Eventually after having this feeling for a day or two I started to worry that I might never ever feel the same again. I went to the doctor about 2 days after the incident and he prescribed me prozac. I took prozac hoping that it would be some sort of instant cure. While it wasn't a cure, it certainly did help. The prescription did not help immediately, but eventually after taking it for several months it was like a maintenance for my anxiety and to keep it in check. I took it for a long time (I forget how long). Being aware that taking non-natural drugs can alter the brain I wanted to get off it as soon as possible. I recently did get off of it, but at the beginning of December 2018 I started feeling just a constant anxiousness again and I'm just sick of it. I just want my life to return to before that night.

Does anyone have any advice?",Anxiety
"Anxiety from dysfunctional family. Trigger warning for physical abuse and infidelity. 

I'm 18, still in high school and currently living with my two parents and my brother who is 20.

My family has always been dysfunctional but I feel like it's gotten worse faster.

Growing up I've always felt like my parents hated each other. They would get into fights and break glass and threaten to hurt each other. I genuinely don't understand how and why they've been together for so many decades. We were poor and lived in bad houses with no electricity a lot of the time and no water, usually roaches and rats running everywhere.

 I'm the youngest of three; me, my brother and my sister who's the oldest. I've always felt like I was considered the bad child, and I will say I did scream and cry a lot. But when ever I had done something bad my mom would scream at me and I'd talk back and she'd get so pissed off that she'd chase me with a belt to wack me near my face. Of course I always ran and locked myself into a room and she'd put a hole in the door trying to get to me which only made the punishment worse. 
After many years of this I feel like I barely have any connection to my mom other than we playfully talk to each other sometimes. I don't talk to her at all about what I think about or what's going on with me because she scares me. She genuinely wonders why I don't talk to her about anything, and feels as though her disciple towards me is justified by the Bible. 

I feel like a lot of this has caused my anxiety and I feel a lot of resentment towards my parents because of this. But I also feel guilt when I start thinking about moving out, because my mom tells me I'm the only one in the family who actually pays attention to her. 

Anyways, as I've grown I've learned to just try and keep my mouth shut to not cause trouble. And it's been relatively okay between my parents besides the usual fight every now and again. 

But now since Christmas eve, they've been mad at each other, not sleeping in the same room together, and not even talking to each other. My dad started it because he accused my mom of not paying bills and spending all her money on stuff she doesn't need, which makes no sense because my dad makes a lot more than my mom, and my mom has to work double shifts just to make sure the bills are paid because my dads money disappears so quick somehow. 
My mom worked extra hours just to make sure me and my brother had a good Christmas. My dad spent absolutely nothing on anyone. My sister, her husband, and my mom even bought him gifts.

So cut to now, my mom has been working double shifts, and every time she does now my dad will just up and leave for hours. And this isn't in the middle of the day, this is at like 11 at night while my mom is working 10pm-6pm

He did it tonight, and I just felt it in my gut he was doing something slimey, especially because he took a shower right before leaving and when he came back he walked right to the laundry room, doing who knows what because he doesn't do anyone's laundry.
Doesn't help that my parents accuse each other of sleeping around every time they fight. 

This has started to make me super uncomfortable. I'm thinking of probably telling my mom about this but I'm too scared because I have anxiety attacks when my parents argue. I just want to move out but I don't want to leave my brother to deal with this on his own (he's autistic).

My mom has told me she would kick our dad out of the house if he doesn't get his shit together, but doesn't want me to get involved with it because he'll be angry and might possibly get violent.
This absolutely terrifies me, and prevents me from doing anything except just trying to ignore it, which is basically impossible for me.

I have no idea what to do and I can't stand not doing anything anymore. I don't want this situation to just keep piling up until it eventually blows over into something more serious.

Does anybody have any idea how I could deal with this at all? I've been stressing so bad lately. ",Anxiety
"Went to Therapist Today Went to the therapist today for the first time ever! We talked for more than 2 hours since she had no extra clients today. At the end of it she said I probably to come back and tell her everything else we didn't get for our next checkup. It's funny, as we didn't make a whole heck of a lot of objective progress, but when I left her office, I immediately felt much better about myself and much more confident.

"I can't sleep without my boyfriend beside me. Home is always quiet and lonely. Typically when I'm here I distract myself with video games, books, etc. But of course at night when it's time to wind down, my thoughts race and the fears I normally never think about during the day resurface. 

Recently my boyfriend and I started taking naps together and I can fall asleep almost instantly as opposed to staring at the ceiling for hours. I'm comfortable and I can actually relax when I'm with him. However I can't rely on him to get good sleep; we don't live together.

Any advice on how I can get some shut eye? I've tried a few things like tea, milk and white noise. I'm about to attempt melatonin supplements but again I don't want to have to rely on something.",Anxiety

"Anxiety within the relationship. Advice? I'll save you the whole story, I moved in with my friend Sam, I was living with him for about 6 months and we starting being intimate, and we've been together for a year now.

I know I won't find anyone better than sam and I've accepted that fact. My anxiety has manifested in ways that I've never seen it before. I've gotten my worst anxiety attacks from Sam, I've gotten the most self hatred from Sam. 

Sam is kinda petty and a very angry person, when Sam gets angry, I get anxious and I just shut down. Then Sam belittles me, and makes me feel like shit that I'm not doing anything to comfort him, which leads me to being even more anxious. I don't know how to handle any kind of negative emotions. If Sam displays any emotion of anger, sadness, or anxiety, I just shut down, because I don't know how to handle it, or fix it. Communication is my biggest weakness. Emotions in another weakness, and those 2 together is a fucking shit show.

Anxiety has cause me to constantly question and doubt our relationship. We work well together, but there's always that voice that says no. It makes fun of me, Sam, and everyone else. It's like a little voice that hijacks my thoughts and makes me have thoughts I don't agree with. 

Me and Sam have never had an argument, but we have made plenty of double anxiety attacks; Sam gets mad, I get anxious, Sam gets even more mad that I don't do anything, Sam gets anxious, then I get more anxious. It's a fucking shit show. And every time we have these, I feel like shit and I constantly feel like I need to take pills to fix the way my thoughts are.",Anxiety

"Does this sound like anybody else's experience? I've always thought that there was something wrong with me somehow. I'm forgetful, I lose things and have no idea how. I didn't have any friends when I was little. So I'm gonna preface this by saying that I've never been diagnosed with anxiety, and I may just be seeing a problem where there isn't one. I'm trying to get a therapist to help me see if a do have a problem but my mom says she's gonna take a long time looking because she wanted me to get the right one. At first, she wanted me to talk to a church counselor but there was no way I was gonna do that and I made that very clear. She says there's nothing wrong with me and that she has all the same problems I do.

Now with all that said, I do think I have anxiety. I worry a lot about things and I go over them a lot in my head. I'm always worrying about what people think about me and everything I do or say, constantly doubting myself and it's exhausting. But I don't think anxiety prevents me from doing anything, it just makes me feel bad. I also don't get panic attacks or anything. 

I'm going to tell a story as an example of my experience but it's not really necessary to read. One day I brought these expensive art markers (Copic) to school. A few hours later I saw on the hallway floor, the box covered in scribbles, with one marker missing.  I wasn't sure if I dropped it or someone left it behind after messing with them in the class I had been in. There was a notecard that was scribbled on as well. I told a teacher and immediately regretted it. I thought a multitude of things: *what if the scribbling was my friends? what if I just dropped it? that notecard looked familiar? why can't I remember what happened? what's wrong with me?*

That ate at me all day. I went after my friends that were there, practically interrogated them. My heart beat hard before I talked to the last one, praying I wasn't out of line. And I wasn't. He said that he didn't do any of what I saw. I was still unsure about it but I felt a little better.

"Worried about going back to teaching I suffered a relapse last year and I managed to emerge from it with a higher dose of medication and another new medication that was added.
I was not a hundred percent but I managed to get past each day somewhat OK.

I've been on vacation for the past month (I'm a teacher) and I'm experiencing symptoms again despite being away from my main trigger which is teaching.

It happens whenever I go to crowded areas mainly shopping malls. My vision gets blurry, my face and chest feel hot and my knees feel like they are going to collapse. I've not exactly been taking my medication on time as I was on vacation mode. I really hope that it's because of this.

I start teaching tomorrow onwards and I'm very worried that I'm going to experience those symptoms again. It's really very demoralising and I don't want to start the school year feeling so jittery.

"Flying with anxiety/paranoia Going on a weekend trip to Vegas Friday, coming back Sunday. Ive flown before but I didn't have the massive anxiety like I do now.

I do have Ativan I plan on taking before we board. No caffine starting tomorrow and until after we get back. Also have some noise cancelling head phones I'm taking with my tablet with movies and shows pre loaded on it.

But I can't stop thinking that I'm going to have a total freak out once I'm on the plane. I'm slightly claustrophobic, getting worse as time goes on it seems. Fear of heights. Generally paranoid that something horrible will happen. Considering that I've lost 2 husband's in the last 4 years I can see where the ptsd, paranoia and anxiety come from.

But I don't want those things to limit my life. I've never been to Vegas, I'm going with my sister in law which happens to be my best friend. This will probably be 1 of the only times to get to do this and I don't want to miss out.

Fear of death I have had anxiety and panic attacks since 14. SSRIs help a ton.

"Need advice on asking doctor for additional heart tests for peace of mind (without sounding crazy) For the past 2-3 weeks I have been experiencing chest pains that come and go (24 y/o female). Last Wednesday I went to my doctor for it, and they performed an EKG that came back normal. She told me I just am experiencing anxiety (which she already knew of my history with, including medications I'm on.) 

I thought that would ease my mind and the chest pains would go away if it was anxiety, but they didn't. I'm worried the EKG isn't enough, and I feel like I need more peace of mind (really just an echo at the minimum). How can I request an echo or referral to a cardiologist and be taken serious (since she already knows I have anxiety)?

Side note: My maternal grandma had a congenital valve heart problem, but it didn't affect her until she was 60 or so. My doctor doesn't know about this because I just learned about it this past weekend from my mom. So that's not helping with my anxiety over the pains either. 

I've suffered from GAD/anxiety attacks since 2014, but never have I had chest pains outside of a full-blown anxiety attack itself so I've been in a perpetual state of more anxiety because of these physical symptoms, and I'm unable to sleep at night for fear of not waking up due to an unknown heart problem.

I have this thing where I constantly feel my thoughts becoming a reality so I felt it happen while in a dissociative almost a hypnotic state. I panicked as I got in the bath.

"Managing severe work anxiety I'm a high school senior who really needs to start saving up money for college next fall (thankfully not for tuition (yay scholarships), but for daily expenses and the like). I think I've got a job as a cashier at Foodwise lined up if I want it, but I'm already feeling anxious over it. 

I had a bad time at my first (and last) job at Sonic last year. Management sucked, they were often high and/or would treat you like you were a complete idiot if you messed something up (even if no one explained it to you in the first place). My training was a whole 5 minutes long and I spent the first few weeks dealing with angry customers because I didn't know how to input orders properly or make all the different kinds of ice cream correctly. The building was small and cramped and I could barely hear anything of the sounds of the kitchen and order siren blaring constantly. They would often tell me to clock out when I was legally supposed to since I'm a minor and then ask me to do just one more thing- Stock up the cups and straws real quick- Clean off the dirty utensils- Wipe down the ice cream machines- Cut up some limes and lemons- and I'd be there for another 30+  minutes after already clocking out. They just forgot to pay me for an entire day I worked, and would have gotten away with it if my mom didn't catch it. I felt like they would screw me over at any opportunity.

I had really bad anxiety every day I went to work. One time I flat out started hyperventilating in the car on the way there and my mom almost took me to the ER bc my hands had gone completely numb and locked up. I quit a couple weeks after that because it just didn't feel like it was worth it anymore.

Now I'm worried that the same thing will happen at my new job. Or worse, what if I'm actually the problem, not the work environment? How will I function as an adult if I can't go to work without having a panic attack? Does anyone have any advice?",Anxiety
"I thought I've gotten better but I'm withdrawing again This is my first post ever, I don't normally post or make any comments at all...

I'm 21, female, living in Australia. 
I used to be very friendly and all, but 3 years ago, after my ex broke up with me, I started avoiding every single social contacts that I should've been making, even with my parents, that also included 2 gap years I spent home and literally do nothing. 

However last year, as thought I got somewhat better, I started attending uni, and even joined a club, but I rarely go to their activities, just something to tell my parents so they wouldn't worry about me. 
Despite having troubles communicating to people irl, I have no problems dealing with online people at all, in fact, im pretty active online, especially on Discord. 

Somehow, I was able to make friend with a person from the club (mostly bout Japanese culture, and I'm a weeb, so is that person), called Abc. At first we just talk online, then I got an invitation to his place for gaming and singing, we became closer after that, but since I'm well aware of myself, I always refused to come to their parties or meeting with more than 5 people, which starts to make me feel sick. 

Everything was still under control, until the 31st of Dec, when a friend of his (L for short), who added me on Facebook, insisted me to come to his party. I thought Abc would also come, and I asked for the confirmation of the number of people that would be coming. When I'm sure that there wouldn't be that many, I asked my mum, she encouraged me to go too, so I ended up coming.

I ended up spending time in my own space and tried not to communicate with as many people as possible, I must say I always enjoy spending time by myself. However, as couldnt be helped, the people from the party came and started asking me questions, and even questions that I always avoid: relationships related. I got scared and, made an excuse that I needa talk to and online friend, then sat outside the garden for hours, and when I realized it was already 4AM. L offered me his bedroom so I would come inside, as how tired I was, I unwillingly accepted. The next day 6 of us went have lunch, then I asked L if he could dropped me at the movies since I wanted to see Aquaman (he seemed surprised since I went all by myself). After coming home that night, my head hurt, and I got really scared of hearing noises. 
I went to see my therapist, was advised that I should still see people rather than shutting myself down, and was given a prescription in case I get worse. 

I've been shutting in for 3 days now, I can't even voicechat, talk to my parents or do anything that is communicating related, I'm ok with chatting still, but seeing people creeps me out. 

If anyone has any advices or any suggestions that you think I should be doing, please let me know! Tysm...",Anxiety
"Boyfriend didn't die but still can't sleep. My boyfriend woke up with a sore throat one morning. A week later he was put on a ventilator and ECMO (Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) due to sever Acute Respiratory Distress. Miraculously he was extubated and taken off ECMO 3 weeks later. The doctors expect him to make a full recovery. 

I am of course very grateful for the outcome. However, my anxiety is out of control. I'm having these attacks where I break out in a cold sweat and feel like I'm going to pass out. I can no longer sleep. I can't seem to turn my mind off at night. I constantly have flashbacks of the crash carts, the codes, seeing him lifeless, the Chaplin, etc. Its also affecting my ability to even be around him without feeling panic. 

I'm not sure if this is something that will go away on its own in time or if this is something I need to talk to a doctor about. I remember the doctor telling us it's a possibility he may suffer from PTSD at some point in his recovery but man they don't really talk about what it's like for the loved ones. ",Anxiety

"Don't know what to do about college presentations I'm in a business school and most classes require a lot of presentations.  I had severe panic attacks last semester and was throwing up before hand.  I get extremely nauseous sitting in class waiting to present.

I tried beta blockers but they make me violently ill so I cant even take them. I thought they were going to be the fix and now I dont have a solution.  I dont know what to do because even waiting to say my name to the class makes me on the verge of fainting and throwing up.

I cant join any toastmasters because the meetings run while I'm in class.  We also dont have toastmasters at our school.    I cant drop the classes with presentations because I'm in a full time program that doesnt allow that.  And also it's about 50% of my classes have presentations.

I dont know what to do because I cant drop classes and I'm already starting presentations soon this semester.

"I think I'm having my first anxiety attack. I always knew I was an anxious person, but I'm freaking out right now. I feel like just typing this out will help me through this. 



I started taking 200mg of Wellbutrin recently, upped from my 100mg dose in December. I always thought I had an anxiety issue,  but reading what I'm feeling now comparing it to symptoms online, I suppose this is my first anxiety attack. It has happened 3 times in the last few days. It started with my chest getting tight, then sudden tingling in different spots of my body, one at a time. I started freaking out, thinking something was wrong with my heart, and thus, googling frantically. I started getting this sinking feeling in my heart and stomach every 10-15 seconds. It felt like my heart was being electrocuted and then set on fire. It felt like my body kept getting that sinking feeling like when you go down a steep drop but all over. This fear of impending doom. It felt awful. It felt like I was dying. I was getting brain zaps at the same time. I'm getting heart palpitations, and I feel like I'm going to die. I contacted a doctor I knew over the phone who said it sounds like withdrawal (I did forget one dose of my Wellbutrin yesterday and the day before,) however I took my meds over 12h ago. Usually I would feel better pretty quickly with Effexor if I experienced withdrawal. 



Anyways. I'm scared. This is horrifying. I can't help but feel like I'm dying. ",Anxiety

"This time last year I couldn't leave my bedroom because of anxiety, today I talked myself down from a panic attack during a surgical procedure. I'm a 22 year old guy and my anxiety was horrible a year ago. I was unemployed, my life ruled by anxiety. I couldn't drive, go out with friends, see a movie, and for a while didn't leave my room. It got so bad I was severely underweight and stayed in a psych hospital for a few days. I began to see a therapist who did CBT 3 times a week, plus saw a psychiatrist and got on the right medication. 

Now I work in a big hospital operating room as a technician full time, I drive all the time, go on dates, and I start school to be an EMT Monday. Today I was assisting during a gastric bypass. I was fully scrubbed in, holding a camera where I have to be dead still, and it's just me and the 2 doctors, all crammed around this patient. It wasn't the first time I assisted during this surgery, but it was my first time with this doctor, who's notoriously vicious, and at one point shit started to hit the fan. The room got silent, tensions where high, and my anxiety skyrocketed. My mask started to fog up and I was sweating, but I can't touch my face and contaminate my gloves, so I was literally trapped. Then I remembered everything I had learned, I started to focus on my breathing and the work the doctor was doing. I thought to myself encouraging thoughts, and within a minute my anxiety dropped back down, and we ended up completing the surgery. The best part? The doctor told me I did a great job, something even the nurses had rarely ever heard him say to someone. 

The point of this post? To look at where I was a year ago, basically bedridden from anxiety. Now I live a very full life and do things that I want to, not that my anxiety lets me do. You CAN improve and get your life back. If I did it, any of you can do it. The biggest advice I can give is please, get help. I was terrified but it saved my life. I still go to therapy once a month, and I'm still on my medications, and there is absolutely no shame in that. 

I hope this post maybe inspired even one of you. Dealing with anxiety has been the hardest thing I've ever done, and I failed but didn't stop trying. No one has to live like this, and no one has to do it alone. I wish everyone here the absolute best of luck conquering your inner demons, and I believe in you.

"How to deal with mean/rude coworkers? I have pretty bad social anxiety and self esteem. I have horrible anxiety around people not liking me, and due to this I have really changed my personality to be super super nice and giving to those I don't know very well such as coworkers.

I recently have started a job as a server. I wanted to be more outgoing and overcome my fear and anxiety with rude and mean people by becoming a server, where I have to deal with these type of people everyday.

This has gone fine, and since I'm super nice not many customers have been rude to me. I have always gotten them to understand any problems I have serving them, etc.

But I have this one coworker that, to her, I can't do anything right with. Every time I mess up or have a problem (or even an honest question) she talks down to me and makes me feel stupid, using that condescending voice where she emphasizes every word. Sometimes she will talk to other people about me too. It also doesn't help that she is just naturally a very outgoing and confident person, which is something I've always wanted to be. 

I know to any normal person they would just get over it, or just say fuck her, I'm fine and let it go. But it makes me want to cry in the bathroom every time I have to work with her. It has ruined anyI confidence I have and really has worsened my self esteem even more. It's gotten to the point where I am actually embarrassed of myself there and every time I inconvenience someone I have to hold back tears.

My anxiety leaves me feeling so weak and child-like. Like I obsess over the littlest things and interactions and I get so insecure and upset easily.

"Anyone else struggling with shame of ""unwarranted"" anxiety? Hey Reddit,

Lately my anxiety has been getting worse. Today was a bad day. I read a lot of stuff on the subreddit that helped me feel a little more ""normal"" for having anxiety. It has been really nice to read things that I can relate to. One aspect of my mental illness that I haven't really seen mentioned has been bugging me a lot lately. A lot of people with anxiety and mental illness have some really specific trauma that has caused it. One of my good friends that I talk to about anxiety was molested as a child. Another one of my friends had his father commit suicide when he was 8 years old. Just today I read a post here about a guy with anxiety that set in after his best friend murdered his family. A lot of the anxious people are lonely. Etc etc. The list goes on.

I have very little ""trauma"" in my past - if you can even call it that. I have a normal life. A good life, even. A million things to be grateful for. Most of all I have an incredible loving and supportive wife that does her best to help me with my struggles with anxiety.

When my anxiety flares up I can't help but look around at all the great things about my life and feel a crushing shame that I am struggling with mental illness anyway. Why would I be anxious and depressed when I have so much to celebrate? My therapist always catches me saying stuff like ""I shouldn't feel this way"" and tells me I need to stop with that. But its really hard. When trying to relate to others with anxiety, I start to get imposter syndrome because I can see WHY they have anxiety. It makes sense. But when I look at my own life, it doesn't make sense to me. I feel like I haven't ""earned"" the right to be struggling with anxiety. It always turns into this awful shame cycle where I criticize myself for not being happier or more grateful for the good things I have.

"anxiety about dad's remarriage hi all, first time poster on this thread. not really expecting to much feedback, just need to get out of my anxiety loop and share with a safe community.

My parents have been divorced for 20 years and my dad is getting remarried in March. It was a really rough, spiteful separation and there has not been a lot of love in my family since. I've grown up with extreme anxiety and depression that was exacerbated by my family situation.  I'm happy for my dad, his fiancee is already like family to me, but I have so much anxiety around marriage, especially remarriage. I had always thought to myself that, even though my parents were divorced, at least they weren't remarrying. Changing the family dynamic even more, in ways that I don't have control over, terrifies me. It doesn't help that my dad didn't talk to me or my sister about proposing to his then-girlfriend. I have a lot of emotions and stress around the whole situation. I thought at least that I would be able to bring someone to the wedding, a buffer of sorts, so I won't get to overwhelmed by anxiety or feelings of isolation and sadness. But I just found out that I can't bring anyone with me. Even though my sister was allowed to bring her boyfriend and my cousins are bringing S/Os, I don't get a plus one. 

I'm really freaking out. I know I have time to prepare for this wedding, but I am so scared that I am not going to be able to make it through the ceremony or party or speeches or toasts without completely breaking down and ruining my dads wedding. I don't want to make a scene and ask my dad and his fiancee to alter the entire table setting so I can bring someone. They don't understand my mental health needs and I don't think they would be receptive to my need for a buffer. I don't want to remember it as something I wasn't strong enough for or remembering it as one of the most stressful days of my life. I see my therapist in two weeks, but in the meantime, I don't want to revel in these thoughts during that time. If anyone has any experience coping with family events, any support is appreciated.

When the anxiety eats up you from the inside
Because you've been trained to put on a brave face
And your guts turn to liquid
And your heart into a jackhammer
And your brain into cotton

When the anxiety eats you from the inside
Because you've been trained to put on a brave face
The choices become
More
Difficult

When the anxiety eats you from the inside
Because you've been trained to put on a brave face
It's harder to believe that
You're worth
Anything

It's harder to believe
That there is 
A silver lining
An end 
To this 
Feeling

It's harder to choose
To see
That there can be 
Something
Good

It is
So much more
Difficult
To choose
To be
Happy

But it is a choice
And I will break this cycle
I am not my thoughts
I am a survivor

I choose to be happy",Anxiety
"does anyone else get social anxiety really bad in public to the point where you're nauseous and almost puke? i'm working, and just went out to lunch with a coworker. i'm hungry and i get canes fairly often because, well i like it. was normally eating, when i suddenly got extremely nauseous to the point of gagging, and almost puking up my food. 

has anyone else experienced this, where your anxiety just sky rockets? i usually feel nauseous every morning before work but i get over it. this nearly throwing up thing is kind of rare though. i always just feel extremely uncomfortable in social places. ",Anxiety
"Am I blowing this up or did I really do some really bad stuff? (Anxiety ruining my education) Hi everyone! I mostly lurk on here and this subreddit is usually very comforting to read stories from other people dealing with anxiety.

My anxiety has become worse and worse since I entered university at 18 (I'm 21 now). In my first year I struggled a lot with assignments and that continued afterwards as well. In my second year I had some issues with plagiarism and mistakes that made me reflect on all my previous assignments as well. After this mistake it ruined all of my self confidence in my studies and for instance in my third year I only got 10 out of 60 points of the year because I was constantly thinking about whether I did or did not deserve my education and the opportunities the eventual degree will give you. This has given me a lot of anxiety, constantly overthinking and even talking with my professor a year afterwards if I really didn't do something wrong that required me to be kicked out or something. 

My mistakes in my second year made me reflect on one of my biggest coping behaviours to deal with my anxiety and perfectionism: making up excuses. I hate that I do it, but for some reason I can't ask anyone for help or fail because then I have to admit I am incompetent and don't know how to do it. 

Okay so now back on my reflection. I reflected back on a course that I had in my first year for writing skills and then I failed to hand in some assignments because according to me they weren't perfect enough. This obviously affected my average grade but I managed to get a passing grade in the end. Now I read back and some of that work was actually compulsory. I am so scared that the excuses I gave to my sweet professor made her sympathetic and made her pass me instead of judging correctly because of the uncompleted work. 

I am in this loop of whether I did or did not deserve to pass my courses and deserve my education and it is killing me. A lot of these mistakes are two or three years ago and I can't solve the damage they did anymore. I really want to do another degree in the future but im worried that I am cheating the system by having writing and research skills (course is very reading/writing heavy) that I did not deserve to be taught because I should've been failed before.

I explained this to my mum as some of my reasons to drop out, because the guily is absolutely killing me. She is saying I sound like someone who has gone crazy and that I am blowing up little details but they aren't little details to me? My old psychologist already suggested ADHD as well as GAD to me, but I'm feeling like i'm looking for excuses for my shitty behaviour instead of really struggling like people with actual issues in their life. I have such a strong urge to go to a study advisor and confess everything I've done to them, but everyone around me is saying I'm completely overreacting and I just need to talk with a new therapist about dealing with my anxiety and stuff.

"Venting about Anxiety from Intrusive Thoughts I'm doing this on a throwaway cause it's kind of embarrassing, but I suffer from this thing where I'm afraid to do things that are ""sinful?"" I guess?   

So, I'm afraid to say Jesus Christ or God Damn stuff like that out loud AND IN MY HEAD (I know that's weird but idk lol). 
  
But the thing is, I'm not even religious. I consider myself an atheist, which makes me super confused. I think it's because my mind is always like, ""Oh, what if?"" and ""How would you explain this?"" Honestly this just makes everything 10x worse because I think I'm crazy, and I can't tell if they are intrusive thoughts or not (which I do suffer from). So I'm always doubting my religious beliefs. 

But anyway, I just now said to myself these things out loud to try and get rid of these fears. I said (((btw sorry if u are religious, nothing against that this just helped me))) Jesus Christ out loud and stuff like that. I said some kind of cringy stuff that I won't type lmao, but anyways I'm not gonna lie I was scared that my whole family was gonna die right then, and that I was gonna die right there of a blood clot or something, idk I'm still kind of scared, but I think it kind of helped. 
  
On treating intrusive thoughts I've read to not ignore them or make them go away but to acknowledge them and then don't give them attention, which I'm not really doing so this might end up making it worse idk. 

anyways just wanted to vent because my mind is very annoying and I just want to be normal lol. ",Anxiety
"Meds before a work presentation? Hi. I seek advise and encouragement. I have a presentation scheduled for later this month. Just the thought of it makes me anxious. I have some xanax (0.5 mg) leftover from a few years ago when I was under the care of a doc. I'm considering taking one pill the morning before the meeting. Public speaking is definitely panic inducing to a point where I feel like the room is closing in, my voice trembles and all I hear is my heart beating and I feel it in my head. 

I plan on rehearsing my presentation regularly until the day of the meeting so I can be prepared and confident in my speech. But I do feel like taking a pill will help. I just don't want people to think/know I'm medicated.

"I feel lost and need help So I hardly ever post or comment on Reddit but I decided to write on here because honestly I feel so alone. I'm going to just write a little background about myself: Last year I was laying in bed when this awful feeling of not being able to catch my breath started happening. I didn't recognize it as a panic attack at the time because I had not ever experienced that before, at that moment I thought I was having a heart attack even tho I am only 29. My wife drove me to the hospital while I sat in the passengers side freaking out because I couldn't breath and it felt as if my throat was going to shut. At the ER the doctor told me that I was having a panic attack. It scared the hell out of me but I was told it was nothing serious. I thought that this panic attack was going to be a one time thing but sadly it wasn't.

So now a year and 35k worth of medical bills later I am having constant panic attacks and major anxiety. I don't feel like anyone understands my issues. My family doesn't communicate well so I find it hard to talk to them. My friends think I'm just being lazy as I haven't been able to keep a steady job or attend church/meetings (I grew up in a very religious environment). Most of my friends have abandoned me because they do not know what to do for me and as I said before they are mad that I am not going to church. Even my wife doesn't know how to help me and has threatened me with divorce a few times. I know I have let a lot of people down but I'm having the hardest time doing simple tasks even at home when it comes to taking care of myself. I am in therapy and I'm on medication but nothing seems to help. I feel every day the anxiety gets worse and the panic attacks make me feel crippled. I've met many people who have said they suffer from anxiety  but up until a year ago I did not realize it could be this bad. I'm at my wits end right now. I have all these suicidal thoughts and it scares me that I can even rationalize that being an option. 

 Is there anyone that can relate to anything I've said? I can't seem to relate to anyone in my life right now. I am terrible at explaining myself but I would love it if anyone out there can at least say they understand or care. I am so tired of feeling alone all the time. ",Anxiety

"I have nobody to tell so I'm going to tell you guys! I finally sent a message to my crush and faced my fears and anxiety! About a year ago I met this wonderful guy online. We hit it off as buds and were friends for about six months. We didn't talk much towards the end, but it was still someone I'd consider a friend. Our first phone call was five hours and I've *never* talked on the phone with anyone for five hours hours. 

He told me he was moving. He disconnected from everything for months until he successfully relocated, in which he came back to the online world without saying a peep to me. I went back and forth about messaging him for months - was I ghosted, did he not want to be my friend, did I say something weird, what happened? After all, he did try to call me before he disappeared and wouldn't pick up when I called back. It was all confusing and since he disappeared I didn't even know if he got my call back or text message. 

So yesterday, I bit the bullet and asked how he was doing for the first time in almost a year. I was so anxious, my heart was pounding, but I hit send and threw my phone on the passenger's seat (was about to drive home) and drove. To my surprise he answered right away and matched my level of excitement! 

We ended up going back and forth for majority of the day where I learned he was flying back to his new state after visiting home (erg, I just missed him!). We were getting into good conversation when he left me on read due to the flight. 

I'm glad I did it. I have no regrets. It's just kind of sad that I don't think he wants to pursue anything further than ""catching up"" a couple times a year. But who knows... he's surprised me before and maybe I'll be hearing from him more often. He told me to let him know when I make it out to his state (which I never will haha but it was a nice gesture). The long distance thing is tricky. 

My hope is that next time he comes home here that we can hang out in person and catch up that way. Sending the first message eased my thoughts so greatly and I'm very proud of myself. ",Anxiety
"How to stop distractions Hello lovely people, I hope you're all doing ok.

My question is about being distracted: I have imaginary conversations in my head *all* the time, it's my natural state. It's been like this for years, maybe ever.

I don't dislike it. It causes me to look a bit in my own world all the time, but I come up with a lot of cool ideas. My brain is overall a pretty fun place to be.

The problem is that it's absolutely impossible to focus whatsoever. Mind that my thoughts are not negative or self critical or catastrophic most of the time, I'm just thinking about my own stuff and distracted. This has impacted extremely hard my education, since in the past year I took 0 exams and I have no idea how to stop this mess.

Seriously, I can't focus (and also I'm a bit lazy by nature so I tend to give up after a few tries). I don't know what to do.

I got tested for ADHD around one year ago, the doctor said she was pretty sure I had it but it doesn't run in the family, so in the end I thought it made more sense to think my racing thoughts were caused by anxiety (which instead runs in the family, my sister, my mom and my aunt all have it).

She says when we feel fear, it's an indication of where we have room to grow.

"I'm costantly worried about my heart rate. Anxiety? Hello there.
I'm a 20yo guy, I don't currently take any kind of medication and I haven't been diagnosed with anxiety (yet), but since a very stressful period that happened some months ago, the symptoms are totally there. However, at first it was simply paranoia, irrational fear, worrying and such, all in my mind basically.

Until I had a dizzy spell last month and I started noticing physical symptoms that could be related to anxiety: unsteadiness, dizziness, brief sensations of head pulsating. I kept thinking about it, possibly worsening my condition, until they went away after about three days.

Now, I'm having a similar problem with heart rate. After suffering from an anxiety attack a couple days ago, I noticed that I could feel my heartbeat accelerating and since then I cannot stop thinking about it. Yesterday, while I was measuring it at home, I went into full panic mode and it spiked at about 120. After that, I tried to calm down and it stabilized around 90 (still high imho). During the day I'm generally more calm and since I woke up today it's swinging in the 70-80 range. However, at night I panic and I really struggle falling asleep.
My main concern is that there could actually be an underlying heart problem. I've had my last cardiological visit 3 years ago and there wasn't any issue, but I'm still not convinced.

Should I go see a cardiologist or is it all related to stress/anxiety?

"I feel like my family gets annoyed by my reclusivity and introversion, and I feel slightly worried about it. I feel like out of everyone in my family, I'm definitely the biggest introvert. I spend most of my time in my room, and whenever I do go out, it's to go to the coffee shop in our local town, in which I just sit at a table in the corner, put my headphones on and just pull myself away from the world. 

(In case anyone is wondering btw, I do have friends, and I do go out and have fun with them on the occasion, so I'm not suffering from loneliness or anything)

I'm usually very quiet around my family as well (there are a few times where I am able to relax, talk a lot and have fun tho), and whenever we go out, I normally put my headphones on and just keep myself to myself. I notice everyone else in the car talking and having fun, and I think to myself ""am I annoying my family by doing what I'm doing right now?"" The same goes for all the other 'signature introvert' things that I do: I leave the dinner table early to I can be left to my own devices; I go to the coffee shop on my own a lot; I don't talk much when we visit family; etc..
Whenever I do these sorts of things, I can't help but to feel really bad for doing them, even though often times I almost couldn't bear to stay any longer.

"Four months off Prozac Hello guys,

I just wanted to share a bit of my story.  For more details you can find my other comments on this sub as I utilized it during my darkest times.  Summer of 2017, I suffered one of the worst panic attacks I have ever had (and hopefully ever will).  It changed me completely, I was a shell of a person for awhile after that.  I had no choice, I had to seek treatment.  I was diagnosed with panic disorder and prescribed 40mg of Prozac.  After a month or two, I felt somewhat normal again.  

Now about me stopping Prozac four months ago...  I always knew I didn't want to be on Prozac for the rest of my life but was willing to accept it if that was what I needed to survive.  At the end of July, I moved across the country back to where I went to college and close to family.  I got a promotion within my company that led to a less stressful job and work environment.  My boyfriend and I got an awesome apartment with no roommate (had issues with former roommate the past three years we lived with him).  I just felt like I was in a really good place.

Then it was time to refill my prescription...  long story short, there was a mix up on whether I could go to CVS to pick it up or if my insurance required it to be sent to me via mail through CVS Caremark.  This whole debacle made it so I hadn't taken any Prozac for five days.  Finally, I got CVS to allow me to pick it up so I went as soon as I was able.  I parked out front on the street and ran in to find out that the override was only good for 24 hours and they couldn't give it to me.  I went outside to find my car gone.  There was no parking on that side of the street after 4:00PM.  It was 4:05PM when I walked out.  My car got towed.  After dealing with getting my car back and realizing I was completely calm throughout the situation, I thought maybe this is the time.  Maybe this is some sort of weird sign that I should stop taking my meds.  I have done tons of research and know that weaning off is the best way to do it.  Something was telling me that I would be okay though.  So I have been off Prozac ever since and I am happy to report that I'm doing great.  I actually feel my emotions more than I did on Prozac.  My happiness is more genuine, I cry more often during sad movies.  I feel normal normal, not the normal I was feeling when I first got on Prozac after being diagnosed with panic disorder.  I never thought I could be here feeling like this.  I was suicidal for a time after the bad panic attack and told myself I'd rather kill myself then go through something like that again.  I just wanted to share my story because I know when I was frequenting this sub I wanted so badly to see success stories and I rarely ever did.

My intention is not to discourage or make anyone feel less than for taking medication.  I wouldn't have survived without it.  I hope that those who wish to get off of them are able to comfortably someday.  And if not, it's perfectly okay.  There is nothing wrong with taking meds to help whatever mental disorder is going on in your life.  My best wishes are with all of you out there struggling.",Anxiety

No matter how larger or small the group is or how well I know them, I've had a really hard time managing my obsessive thoughts and anxiety around the situation. In conversations with my therapist, he mentioned Beta Blockers and I've been doing a bit of research. They seem like they might help based on my symptoms around public speaking.

I have no issue being prepared, but my heart pounds and my breathing becomes shallow. All of this causes me to get a really bad voice shake and quiver. I know the whole room can tell I'm a nervous wreck and I can't recover. I've become so obsessed with the thought that this is going to happen every time that I've been unable to overcome it and get past it.

It seems like Beta Blockers might reduce those symptoms so that I won't have to worry about appearing nervous?

Does anyone have experience with them? Are they simple to get? Can I just schedule an appointment with my doctor and get them or will it be more involved?

Don't love the idea of taking medication. I've been able to avoid it for a long time but I really think I need this to get me to the other side of this.

"How to stop anxiety from affecting my relationship..? I've (18F) been dating a wonderful boy (18M) for over a year now. I told him about my anxiety disorder fairly early on in the relationship and explained to him i was on medication to control it. he was totally okay with it, because he also struggles with other mental illnesses such as depression. however, i'm worried now that he will get sick of my anxiety and will eventually leave me because he can't handle it. we hit a rough patch in our relationship a couple months ago when i had found out he was being flirtatious with a girl he knew from a summer program he did. of course, this combined with my already worrisome attitude did not sit well with me. ever since then i've been having him show me his texts, his snapchats, etc. i have panic attacks when he goes and hangs out with friends that include other girls and i'm not there. if girls are friendly with him or want to hang out, i freak out. i understand i could be in the wrong here, but i don't know how to change?especially now that the has given me a reason to be like this. i had a bad feeling about that girl he spent the summer with, so now every time i have a bad feeling i think something is totally wrong. he went bowling with people from the summer program and left me behind, so i had the worst panic attack i've had in a very long time and self-harmed for the first time in years. i don't know how to change my attitude. i am very serious about our relationship and i want to marry him, and i have felt this way since the day i met him. he tells me he wants to marry me too?(for the record, he claims he always saw that girl as a friend, but admits he was acting inappropriately with her. he told me he never planned on leaving me). but i still wake up at night having nightmares about him leaving me or being with another girl. if he left me, i really don't know what i would do. he is my rock and the love of my life. i'm determined to make this relationship work no matter the difficulties it may bring. so, how can i calm down and try not to be so controlling? i can't help it. my anxiety won't stop. my thoughts won't stop. every time something minor happens i can't help but assume the worst. is there any advice for me?

"Once you trigger anxiety can it ever be cured? Curious about this.  I had my first panic attack when I was 18 over 20 years ago now after smoking cannabis, prior to that never had any issues with anxiety.  Since that initial panic attack though I have always had anxiety issues, mostly general anxiety.  Sure you have good days, weeks sometimes months but the general anxiety always returns.  What I mean by general anxiety is feeling uneasy, like something bad is about to happen or that I'll have another panic attack, just living with fear of the fear basically.

I gave up alcohol 3 months ago due to terrible general anxiety I would get the day after drinking, I was reading a book on quitting alcohol and the guy said once you've triggered anxiety or once you start getting anxiety with a hangover you'll always get it, you can not unforget it, you can not go back to the time before you started having anxiety.  And I wonder how much of that is true not just for hangovers etc but for general anxiety in general, once you trigger it is that it?  As I say I have always had it since that first initial panic attack triggered it.",Anxiety
"Anxiety makes me unproductive and I feel I am going to die. Please help ?

I have been suffering from depression and anxiety disorders for many years now. Usually that includes bizarre, incongruent thoughts and fears that paralyze me and makes me want to never leave the bed. This is followed by many compulsive behaviours (like washing hands, checking the house, praying) to deal with the anxiety. This all makes me very, very depressed because I feel like I am not a normal person and I don't deserve to be in this world.

?

My recent problem is that the depression and anxiety are really affecting my work and productivity. Some years ago, I could cope with all of this and I would keep working the best I could and no one would complain of the quality of what I do. People would rely on me and I would get the work done, I would be proactive and responsible. However, nowadays I feel this has completely changed. I don't feel like going to work, I forget deadlines, I take double of the time in a task than I would take normally and I feel completely empty of motivation. I start thinking that if I am fired that wouldn't be a problem, because then I could spend the whole day sleeping or I wouldn't need to leave home so I wouldn't be worried. I take medicine for depression and anxiety.

?

I was wondering if this is me, or the disease. I feel guilty for this laziness but I am wondering if this is who I really am or this is part of the disease talking. I was thought of myself as someone other people could rely on and someone who would always try my best to achieve it. For instance, I have just completed a very demanding master programme (three months ago), in a different country where I don't really speak the language. I had to deal with the pressure of being alone somewhere new, on the other side of the world of family and friends. I manage to go till the end, I got recognition for my marks and my work. But now I feel empty and I don't want to do what I am doing anymore. I feel guilty because I have an amazing partner &amp; family that always support me so I don't have real reasons to feel like this. Please help.

"Focussing on my shortcomings and downplaying my achievements Title says it all. I have a massive inferiority complex and can't stop comparing myself negatively to others (which makes me feel really guilty). I refuse to believe that any of my achievements are deserved.

The result? I constantly push myself to achieve more and learn more and to do more, but I'm still anxious and hopeless about the future. It all ultimately means nothing. I have no sense of self worth and the slightest thing that goes wrong can send me spiralling into a depressive state. I have terrible anxiety because I don't have the confidence that I can do anything.

"Feels like my life is falling apart again. So I signed up for Fall semester of my freshman year of college and was so excited to go.

I decided to drop my classes and focus on my mental health because I knew that if I didn't, school was not going to go well for me. I decided that I would go for the spring and summer semester to make up for the fall semester. So this morning I get to school right when registration starts and go to the Finanial Aid office to clear some things up. I knew the lady in the office was going to be rude to me because she had me almost in tears last time I was there and was making me feel so stupid for things that were out of my control. So anyway I get there and explain the situation to her. The first thing out of her mouth is, If you dropped all of your classes last semester, what makes this semester different? Who's to say you won't do it again? I was dumbfounded to say the least. I've been feeling so good lately. I've been in a good place mentally. I have very very very bad social anxiety and have been working through it the past few months and even managed to score two jobs.

"I've probably suffered with anxiety for some time, but now it seems to have manifested into physical symptoms either that or I have a cardiac issue, though my doctor is in the process of convincing me my heart is fine. Warning this is a long post...
I guess I'm basically just looking for some support as I'm kind of at a loss of what to think and I'd really like to stop worrying about the aches and pains 24/7.


One night in the middle of December I felt this random small pain in my left bicep. Normally I wouldn't have thought much of it, but earlier that day I read a thread that was going around on Twitter about the symptoms of a heart attack in women (bad idea!!!!). I ended up going to bed super early because I just kept thinking about it and couldn't enjoy the show I was watching on TV. The next day my arm felt fine, but I had some discomfort in my chest. After all this time I still can't come up with a right way to describe it other than it being a feeling that shouldn't or isn't normally there. If I had to assign a number to it I'd give it a 1 or a 1.5. The discomfort was on and off all day, but I COULD NOT STOP THINKING ABOUT IT. That afternoon while I sat there googling my symptoms, again a mistake, I could feel my heart rate increasing. I couldn't get it to slow down no matter what I did. I ended up going to an urgent care and when they took my heart rate it was 125. My resting HR is usually 55. The doctor examined me and said she believed it was anxiety and not cardiac related. When I left, my HR had gone down to 69. She gave me hydroxyzine to take when I felt like I needed it. I didn't take it until a few days later and I only took one at night.


Over the next week the chest discomfort came and went, and I couldn't find a pattern. My left arm also started to ache again, like I had been using it too much, but this time instead of an achy feeling in my bicep I felt it in my tricep. It felt like I was wearing a sleeve, not something super tight, but maybe like an Under Armour coldgear top. At this point I called my PCP and made an appointment, but I couldn't get one until after the new year.


I went to my PCP yesterday and they did an EKG, which came out normal, and after asking a bunch of questions they said it was either musculoskeletal or anxiety, though it seemed like anxiety was the probable cause. They asked if I had any history of anxiety and I said not really, but thinking back on it, especially this past year I think I should have said yes. 


In February 2018 my left knee/calf area started hurting kind of out of the blue. It was a kind of pain I never felt before and for whatever reason I got in my head that it was a blood clot. I scheduled an appointment with my PCP, and two days before the appointment I experienced some weird feeling. At the time I thought I was either dying from a PE (unlikely) or having a panic attack (most likely). I was lying on a couch in my basement when suddenly I got really lightheaded and felt like I was falling backwards and the world was closing in on me. I remember being kind of frozen, like I could only look straight ahead and I distinctly remember a white circle of light closing in on me. I thought I was dying until I heard someone from upstairs call my name. It took me a moment, but I kind of broke from the trance and was able to go upstairs. That was when the tears started to flow and I was like shit, I either need to go to the ER or an urgent care for this leg. I can't wait for my regular doctor.


About a week or so after my doctor confirmed I didn't have a blood clot my leg felt better, and it felt good for several months until about August/September when it started randomly hurting again. This time though it's more of my thigh. Also, in August I was in my basement again and I don't remember anything that could have provoked it other than a really severe bit of cramping, but I remember feeling like I had to throw up and I started to hyperventilate. A million things were racing through my head at this point, what they were I couldn't tell you. I'm sure there were tears because I was scared and my heart rate was also elevated. After about 30 minutes, though it felt like an eternity, it all went away. I haven't experienced anything similar since, not even during this current situation.


Of course when I saw my PCP I hadn't really experienced any aches or pains for about 3 days, go figure, so they said we'll see how it goes. I'm supposed to go for routine bloodwork and then go back to my doctor for a physical. I think when I go back I will bring up the fact that my leg still hurts, though this time in a different spot, and mention what happened in Feb and August.

"Anxious over fight I had with my boyfriend! Help! So I'm a sufferer of GAD, and I'm very anxious about a (resolved) fight with my boyfriend last week.

He then very rudely stated that maybe he would date a girl like that one day, and I was heartbroken. He has depression and it makes him very irritable sometimes and he had been snippy that whole entire day. So right after he said it, he apologized profusely and said that he only said it because he was irritable and wanted to say something mean. This is the first time in our 2 year relationship that he has ever said or done something like this. Well I got really upset because infidelity is a very sore spot with me and the thought of him being with another woman is soul crushing. He knows what he said was wrong and has told me that he did not mean it at all.

"Job anxiety I'm new to anxiety. I've always had a bit, and it runs in my family, but I thought I'd escaped the family curse.

Not so much. I took a break from work, thinking I'd clear my head and then find something pretty easily. I didn't. It was a pretty difficult 8 months where I waffled between starting my own business, interviewing and doing consulting. I finally took a job and it was terrible.

I vomited every morning from anxiety and dread. I worked 18 hours a day because if I wasn't working, I was having painful anxiety about work. I lost a ton of weight. I couldn't eat. I genuinely felt like anxiety just took over my entire life.

Because I'd never experienced this level of anxiety, I assumed it was the job. I switched jobs. The new place is a better fit, job wise anyway.

It's a little better, but I'm still having anxiety. I still vomit some mornings. I'm still getting into repeat patterns about getting fired and failing. I have some social anxiety and I've never had that before either. It's like I'm a completely different human.

Part of my anxiety has been dealing with my ADHD. I got drugs for that, hoping I'd eliminate one of the stressors. It's sort of helped, but there's still the vomit.

"My coworker found out about my self-harm issues and it's making me nauseous Background:
Coworker A and me have been friendly since I work here (4 months) and he's occasionally flirty, but even Though I was anxious at first I just ignored his approaches.
So today I was talking to Coworker B who mentioned how surprised she is by my attitude, I always sounded so weird when CW A talked about me. Apparently A has been telling B a lot about me and, even though I don't know any details, most of it wasn't exactly nice.
CW B also told me that A texted her saying that he thinks I'm 'a cutter' and how that totally turned him off.
Especially this made me extremely anxious, I'm nauseous and dizzy and took the long way to my Office to avoid running into A.

I don't know why him being 'turned off' by my scars is so hard for me. I really, really don't want a relationship with A but I feel so abnormal and somehow freaky. To encounter how judgemental people are just scares me because how many others will think the same of me? I've made an effort not to let anyone at work know about my  mental health issues because of stuff like this.
The talking behind my back thing just worsens the situation.

I feel so shitty avoiding him And I know I should talk to him but just thinking about bringing the subject up makes me shaky.

Has anyone experienced something similar and has advice for situations like this?
Thanks for reading.",Anxiety
"Directionless I feel like I'm not going to achieve anything in my life. I feel like I don't know what I'm doing or what I want. I stop liking things once I have to do it for school or work, so how am I ever gonna find something that I won't grow to hate enough to end everything?

I've been having this thought constantly since the end of 2016. That's when I decided to stop in university to take a year off and find out what I really like. I did take a year off, but I didn't find out what I really like. I ended up choosing a different program in a different college in a different city. Now I have the same feelings of ""this isn't it"" and I'm behind in many courses because of it. It's not that I'm not good at these programs, hell I'm more than qualified and my grades can attest to that. I just feel like I'm not going where I want to go with this and I'm too impatient to wait for the penny to drop. 

I'm also dealing with the feeling that I'm able to do more than I'm currently doing. I could do university level stuff if I wanted to, so why aren't I? The reason is pretty simple: I couldn't find any program that peaked my interest but for some reason that is not acceptable in my head. 

There are a hundred reasons why I don't like what I'm currently doing and they're all pretty shallow. Like, they feel like they shouldn't be reasons. Actually some of them are reasons to choose this program in the first place... It's like I'm trying to find excuses to stop so I can do nothing and make no progress every single day. It doesn't help that I can't deal with stressful deadlines and end up procrastinating literally everything.

So now I'm just sitting here, stressing about wanting to make the most of my last few days of Christmas break. I got anxious about the new year, because I feel like time is flying by way too fast and I'm still not doing the things I wanted to by now. I'm gonna be 21 in four months but it feels like tomorrow. I thought I'd have things more figured out by now but I'm still as hopeless and directionless as ever, if not more...",Anxiety
"How it feels Does anyone else feel like their anxiety, to best explain it, would be if you walked into your room and all the furniture was slightly changed, but not enough to pick out what exactly it is, so you're kinda just walking around really slowly and looking around like what the fuck what the fuck what the fuck. Or it's like the suspense before a jump scare- but there is no jump scare- and it's like that forever. ",Anxiety
"Anxiety is destroying my relationship Hi 
I've been with my gf for over a year now but recently things have been rocky (at least from my perspective).

For the past couple months my anxiety has been getting way worse than normal and I'm scared that it's going to ruin my relationship.

I constantly have intrusive thoughts of her cheating on me or not loving me or being sad and I keep on asking if she's okay. This has started to really annoy her because it's gotten to the point where I ask her once every two hours just because I'm terrified that we are/she is not okay.

It would be greatly appreciated if I could get some advice or know if this is normal.

"After years of anxiety I'm starting my first 'real' job this Monday. I feel underqualified and scared. TL;DR I was a mess all my life in varying degrees, picked myself up along the way, got to a stable and workable emotional level which enabled me to work on my professional future. Graduated and landed a dream job which starts this Monday. I still feel like a failure and idiot. Now I'm nervous, scared and full of ice cream. Help. 


To be honest I kinda doubted to post this for quite a while now, but here we go. I could really use some input in how to deal with my worries. I've had a history of anxiety and other psychological issues for about half my life now. Turns out that being emotionally neglected in an abnormal household isn't a great start for a stable and confident personality. 2013 and 2014 (age 19/20) was my lowest point after a very dear friend died by suicide. I started having panic attacks on top of my already present psychological issues and my depression got really severe to the point I dropped out of school for an academic year to start therapy. I was diagnosed with generalised anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, dysthymia, avoidant personality disorder and a panic disorder.


The therapy was successful. To this date the therapy helped me to have a workable emotional baseline. I can function again, don't have panic attacks and constant agoraphobia anymore. This enabled me to continue my education and build a social life. Things aren't ideal though. The old me died along the way a long time ago. I can worry intensely about mundane things like certain expected social interactions or my professional future and I still tend to be avoidant from time to time. So yeah, workable, but not great. The therapy I had was mainly focused on the debilitating issues like my panic attacks, depression and suicidal tendencies that prevented me from living my life. Looking back I feel certain baseline issues may have been overlooked. Dysthymia is also a constant persisting factor in varying degrees and I figure it will stay this way.  


This is the part I'm anxious about for posting this here. I'm really worried someone will think this is humblebragging and will say something mean. I really can't use that at this moment, even if it is from some rando or the Internet. Silly, I know. The language barrier also doesn't make it easy to express myself as accurately as I'd like, so please be kind. All that constant worrying about the things I should do? It payed off. After wrapping up my therapy I continued my education. The constant worrying kept me really focused and even more ambitious then before. I did well. I got my law degree last December. A day after my graduation I received a call I was accepted for a job I'm really excited about but now I'm also scared shitless. Feels really awkward saying this but it plays a big part in why I worry so much about it: it's a really prestigious job which isn't generally fitting for someone with my level of education and being fresh out of uni. If this plays out well I have a great start for my future career. Cue crippling anxiety. I really feel I'm in over my head this time. 


For the first time in many many years (!) everything is looking really bright and I can't fucking deal with it. I start this Monday and I'm so worried about it. Don't know why but it really feels like I cheated myself into this job and that I'll fail miserably once I actually start. I have a way with words (in my native language at least) and I feel like I don't actually have the capacities required for this job, I'm just good at giving that impression. I still doubt if this is true from time to time. The answer varies from day to day. Today I feel like a cheat.


Also really worried about the social aspect. I tried to keep this short and failed miserably already, so without further detail my social worries: not blending in well socially if the work environment turns out to be very masculine, not remembering names or addressing someone with the wrong name, not being liked, visible excessive nervousness (sweating, shaking) and mainly that people will think that I'm awkward. 


God I sound like an awful mess lol but I'm really anxious guys. For the first time everything is looking perfect and it's giving me greater anxiety than when I still was a drop out. It really sucks, I didn't work this hard only to feel even worse. My plan is to pick up therapy along the way again. There's still a lot of work to do. This is however the long term plan and my job starts Monday. I could really use some pointers on how to make my anxiety about my job manageable again. Any other person would be so happy graduating and landing a dream job and I feel really shitty that I just can't feel that way. I want to enjoy this. I want to be proud and feel capable. This is my shot at leaving all my past failures behind me for good and I don't wanna blow it. ",Anxiety
"Dealing with the 'fear of missing out' Hello all,

I find it very difficult to deal with the fear of missing out. There are certain things I want to do and certain things I want to achieve, and I constantly feel that I am missing out on living life to the fullest. This in part also stems from comparing myself constantly with my peers who are doing better than me (in terms of hobbies, career, travelling etc). This creates a constant sense of being not enough. There is a big disconnect (in my personal self image) between where I am now and where I want to be, and this creates an impatience and fear that further generates anxiety.

Have you experienced similar emotions? How do I deal with these mindfully? On one hand it also motivates me to always keep pushing and exploring, but on the other hand it generates lot of negative emotions like anxiety, discontent and self-loathing.",Anxiety

"Starting again after sick leave at university This may just be an incoherent ramble, but let's hope for the best.

In October last year, I just crashed. I was crying all the time, I could barely eat, shower, get up. It was the lowest point, I've ever been at. A well-made mix of depression and anxiety. I wasn't getting any help then, but since I've started group therapy to deal with the anxiety, which is slowly helping, but the results are not overwhelming.

Since I am one of the most stubborn persons on this planet, I decided not to take the whole year off, but try off with a few months, in which I should have written the most important paper, I have to do for my education, in order to finish my degree. This was supposed to be group work, but as I had to take the sick leave, I now have to do it by myself. Which also means that I have to do the oral presentation by myself, which scares the living shit out of me.

I'm starting exams on Monday, another one later this month, lectures for about three months and then another exam (thankfully in a group), and at some point in between this I have to finish my bachelors degree. I am already SO stressed out. It seems like staying at home, just doing the regular stuff like dishes, washing clothes, taking care of my cat and boyfriend, making food and shopping is *enough.* I just don't feel like I can do all those things AND write papers AND go to lectures and socialise - but I don't feel it's a choice to extend my sick leave.

I have been given the choice of medication - sertraline, to be more specific. I've been on fluxotine in my late teenage years (I'm almost 24 now) for a couple of years, and it was hell. I keep reading about the side effects of sertraline, and it doesn't seem worth it, but somehow it seems like the only way to go, to be able to do all these things. 

It just seems so meaningless to keep pushing myself to get this education, because I don't have any particular plans with it. I just needed SOMETHING to do, something that would give me time to mature more and get better. I have no dreams of getting a fancy job, I just wanna get a decent pay to support my future family. I just wanna be happy, but I don't know how to do this. I feel like none of the choices I have, are good enough. I could get a job now, but I'm afraid that I can't keep it because of the anxiety. 



TL;DR: Took a few months of sick leave from uni because of anxiety and depression, now have to start again, but it seems overwhelming. Have the opportunity of starting sertraline, but will it help? I have a major lack of motivation to continue (thanks, depression)",Anxiety
"Too Late to Call Someone.. Need to Talk I just woke up from a terrible dream where I died in a car accident. That was enough to wake me up with my heart pumping fast. I tried brushing it off and falling back asleep but it didn't quite work. 

I then texted my boyfriend about it thinking getting it out might be nice and relieve from stress. 

But now I'm just thinking about things that aren't really related. I recently just started living by myself temporarily. But I've been so anxious about it. Making sure I locked the door. I just am unrealistically imagining someone coming in to hurt me but I know that isn't going to happen. I know I'm being irrational but I can't stop. 

I just want to sleep. Forget about it all. And wake in the morning so there is some distance to the feeling I have now.

"Intense Anxiety for 2nd Semester Study Abroad So I was studying abroad this past fall, but because of the way my program works, we do trimesters, so late September-early December, January-March, April-June is about how it goes, and I'm about to return for the 2nd stretch.

Here's the thing: I don't want to go back. I fly out on Saturday (it's Friday 3AM here) and I want nothing more than to go back to my normal university, hang out with my school friends, and eat Trader Joe's and work with the professors I know and love for the next 6 months. 

I had a good time last trimester, it's not that I was miserable or homesick the whole time or anything, but I just really don't want to go back, like I feel like I did my time. After spending a month at home with my boyfriend and my friends and people who love me, I can't see myself being happy going back to having 4 people I'm close with and living on rice and spending 6 hours in the library every day. 

Looking at the calendar and seeing that I'll be gone for 6 months makes me want to vomit, I've been crying over it all day, and I just absolutely do not want to go back. Anyone else ever experience this? Anyone have any tips to curb this? I'm worried that I'll get there and feel so terribly homesick and awful and want to come home immediately. ",Anxiety

"I want the 2-weeks-ago me back. So I started a new job which I was so excited for. The job is a systems engineering position for a large company and I was super excited to get the chance to futher my my background in IT.

First week was great (started December 17th) went home for Christmas everything was great, coming back the week after that, on Thursday December 27th I was sitting at my computer and had a massive panic attack, I tried everything to ground myself but being that this was my first one I've ever had, none of it was working, I somehow got home and my girlfriend was there to help me with a weighted blanket at that was nice but it was still about 5 hours of a panic attack.

The worst was that I've never had an attack before so I was scared shitless not knowing what was going on. 

I was hoping I'd get better by the end of the day but I couldn't sleep for shit I was like hallucinating or something with my dreams where half of them were reality and the other half weren't  it was awful. 

The anxiety then kicked in after that and I spent the weekend, New year's, and all of this week in a brain fog.

Went to the clinic, they couldn't do anything, called my doctor for a medicine adjustment (gonna lower my dose of strattera from 80 to 40 mg).

Also made an appointment with a therapist for the first time since I was like 12 gonna see em on Tuesday.


Things were looking good I was hoping g to return to work Friday (today) but here I am at 2:30 am writing this post because i was locked in anxiety almost the entire night. 

I had a massive panic attack yesterday (thursday) afternoon at 3:30 pm while just doing some work from my home computer but was able to control it pretty quickly but it still just added more fuel to the fire.

I'm upset, tired, and this is only feeding the anxiety and now I'm terrified that my job is gonna fire me cuz I'm still on probation cuz I'm new for 3 months. 

I think the main stem is that I'm lonely as fuck right now. Two of my roommates are gone leaving only me at my house and work I only know 1 or 2 guys well. I went from being a social butterfly to a shut in without me being aware.

I just want to fucking work, I've worked my ass off to become an engineer and to get the position I'm in.

 I've gone my entire life without a panic attack but now that I've had my first one my life has gone to shit so quickly after just one fucking panic attack. 

I was so fucking happy 2 Weeks ago and now the only emotion I feel is crippling anxiety. I just wish I could fucking restore the emotional state I had two weeks ago.

Just needed to vent really. 

Seeing the community here helps me know that I'm not alone. 

I don't really know what else to do in the meantime anyways, if I lay here I get stuck in my head and will trigger another panic attack. My chest hurts from how tense I've been.

I'm fucking exhausted.

And she's been distant since then. 

I've never been on this subreddit I'm so sorry if I did something wrong or if I'm annoying I just don't know what else to do. 

The alternative has been facetiming my ex.  Just because she's been depressed and lonely, and I feel like I'm going to die 24/7. But we haven't been together for 2 years it's nothing like that I'm crazy about the girl I'm with, she just pulled back at a bad moment and I feel like I can't be alone right now.

"I (early 20s M) had one of my worst anxiety attacks today After almost 6 years of university, during which my mental health gradually deteriorated, I finished my what were supposed to be my last couple of courses. While I was busy looking for jobs during Christmas break, I received a letter from my uni saying that I still don't meet the requirements. 

Although I was pretty sure this was an error, I had anxious and shitty mode until earlier today where I was able to reach my registrar to inquire about the letter. The lady puts me on hold, then transfers me to someone more specialized with graduation. I leave them a voicemail and hang up waiting for a response. While I was waiting, I double checked the requirements only to find out they might actually be right. Cue one of the worst hours of my life. Paralyzing anxiety, self hate, shouting, self insults, hysterical laughter, suicide ideation, and even self harm. Just imagining how I, a full grown man, was laying on my bed punching myself to the point of bruising sends chills down my spine. I started thinking about everything I did wrong in my life and how I deserve this. Started picturing how I'll go back to university after I told everyone that I'm done with this place and how everyone will judge me to no mercy. How the shitty news will affect my parents.

After about an hour, the lady calls me back and tells me that it was an error and I should be good to graduate. I fight back the tears on the phone and then breakdown crying on the floor after I hang up. 

Hours have passed, I've gone out with a friend, ate, and came back but I still can't shake how I reacted out of my head. What the fuck am I going to do for the rest of my life? How the fuck am I going to survive worse news? I have no clue.

"30(M) Finally doing something First Reddit Post! I just wanted to say thank you to everyone on this sub for sharing your stories and experiences. It's been very helpful  for me to be able relate to others who have had been in similar situations.

I just had a heavy drinking night, where I stormed out of my house, and really upset my SO.  I've been considering seeking a therapist or psychiatrist for a few years because I've been  coming to terms with my own anxiety. I've finally worked up the courage to call my insurance network to setup an appointment with an in-network doctor and OF COURSE the psychiatric department is closed on the weekends, so I'm posting to keep myself accountable for Monday morning.

Over the holidays I was terribly sick - some kind of virus got to me and definitely had a weird moment with chest pains. Starting to think I've had a few of those over the past decade along with rapid/irregular heartbeats. Doctors have always said I'm healthy but I'm thinking I may have had panic/anxiety attacks and I just never understood that's what it felt like.

My anxiety has been seeping out into my life more and more in the past several years. I was always a bit of a workaholic and I'm starting to realize that it helped keep the buzzing  voices and self doubt out of my head. Right out of college I moved to NYC,and worked in the Times Square area for five years before moving. I was usually okay on the subway, but I absolutely could not function around the crowds in Times Square. Podcasts helped significantly, and I found myself listening more and more so much that I would panic when I forgot my earbuds (or they broke) and would HAVE to get a new pair immediately. It only got worse over the years and I eventually had to leave NYC because it got to be too much. I'm now terrified of crowded places and I have a pretty hard time in crowded grocery stories. So much so,that I often have to step out and take a breather. I can now see with 20/20 hindsight that this is is likely agoraphobia. 

I moved to break closer to family, but I feel paralyzed about seeing them. My brother lives 20 minutes away,but I can't work up the courage to call him to see him. Christmas this year was really bad,and I had s very difficult time with shopping and seeing family. FWIW - my parents, my wife and my nephew's Brithdays are all within two weeks of each other over Christmas. It has been very difficult the last several years.


I've been abusing alcohol for several years now, to help quiet my brain. For s while I wouldn't be able to sleep unless I was inedbriated. It's been a point of contention with my SO for a while now, and it's gotten to the point where any night that she is working late or out of town. I would do my best to get drunk and fall asleep early. Dumb to try and hide it, I know.

My work ethic has been really flailing lately.  I shifted careers recently and when things are slow I have a hard time getting even simple tasks done. I've been procrastinating on everything and I'm starting to worry that I may be let go because of it. (I'm also terrified that when my supervisors are behind closed doors they're discussing my poor performance, even though I just got a raise 4 months ago and a bonus.) 

So here I am, on a Saturday night holed up with my wife who is furious at me, and I think may be thinking of leaving me. Most weekends, I don't go out much - I've more or less drifted from all my friendships, and social interactions flare up my anxiety unless I'm inebriated. I guess that's why they call it social lubricant.

I've been telling my SO for years I'd see a therapist, but I always chicken out, and get nervous about finding someone who is a ""good fit."" I don't even understand what a good fit would look like. After a day of trying to find help, and just driving around to avoid my life, I felt that I had to accomplish something in achieving my goal of self care. I'm sharing my story here to help keep myself accountable. 

TL;DR - finally recognizing I might have an anxiety disorder and am finally doing something to help hold myself accountable in seeking professional help!",Anxiety
"Anybody know if Teladoc can provide me an excuse note from jury duty for severe anxiety/panic attacks/agoraphobia? I have jury duty in a couple of weeks and have a scheduled phone appointment with Teladoc next week. I know they can diagnose, prescribe medications, and provide excuse notes upon request. But I saw on their website that the length of excuse notes is limited. I believe for mental health conditions, the limit is 7 days and that for long-term excuses, I would have to see a doctor in-person.

Has anyone used a Teladoc doctor's note to get out of jury duty for any reason? Can I be excused from jury duty for a 7-day excuse for mental health? I can't go to doctors in-person at this point due to the severity of my agoraphobia.",Anxiety
"My mom is drowning me with support. My mom discovered from one of my Instagram posts that I have been in the market for a psychiatrist. She was of course very concerned and texted me saying what's wrong. I eventually got to telling her what the general problem was (anxious thoughts, perfectionism), and she says that she wished I came to her first. And of course mentions that she is there for me over and over.

She ALWAYS comments on my posts on Facebook and Instagram being all happy and saying not to sweat things and such. And it's starting to get to me and actually make me feel worse.

How do I break the news to her that I love her but I don't want her involved with my mental health (and the social media commenting)?",Anxiety
Question about anxiety and tingling/numb feeling Been dealing with anxiety this past year. Couple of pannic attacks but I've been getting better at dealing and preventing them. I recently started having these like weird waves of tingling/numb feeling that would affect my forehead and the top front of my head. No pain or anything just a weird feeling. Wondering if anyone has experienced this? I started a acne drug called accutane around the same time they started coming but it's such a small dose I'm convinced it couldn't be from the meds.

"Questions about side effects from Ciprelex My doctor has prescribed my Ciprelex for my anxiety/depression. I have been taking 10mg daily for about 2 weeks. I've noticed a significant disruption to my sleep patterns. For a while, I would barely sleep at all, but would feel tired all day while I was awake. For the past 2 days, I've been sleeping 13 - 15 hours and feeling groggy during the day. I'm wondering - are these side effects temporary? Should I just try to wait it out and see if my body adjusts?

I am depressed and confused, I struggle to build a coherent thought, always seeking some sort of distraction to take away this feeling. Regret, resentment and guilt. Guilt that I never gave it 100%. At the same time I feel somewhat enlightened to find out how shallow and empty I am, holding back as if I have a badass poker face while holding the worst hand the cards could give.

"I'm feeling really hopeless today So in comparison to some of the posts I've read on here, my anxiety and depression is not nearly as bad as some, but everybody's got their own struggles right? Recently it's just gotten a lot worse and I've been having to fight off thoughts that I know are wrong and ridiculous and I'm just so tired. I can physically feel the anxiety in me making my chest tighter and my eyelids heavier and my stomach get tied in knots and it's always there. It's been a while and it's there all the time and it won't go away no matter what I do. I can't get it to go away because I'm trying to get rid of it I just think about it more and then I'm in my head and that makes everything worse.

I also recently went to a psychiatrist where I was prescribed an antidepressant, but that's not supposed to start working for about another month. Even though I've been dealing with this for years already, the closer I get to help, the longer a month seems and the worse it feels to have to keep going like this in hopes the meds kick in. 

And a few months ago I started dealing with it better and then had a setback and I just feel like I'm back to square one. Then even when I make progress one day, as soon as I go to sleep it's like hitting a reset button and it starts all over.  

I'm just getting tired of dealing with this every minute of every day and I'm beginning to lose hope for right now that I'm going to get better at all. I'm sure in a week or too I'll feel differently, but for right now I just want to give up. I just want to be able to be awake without feeling like something's wrong and being nervous all the time.

"I spilled water on my laptop and it appears to be working normally, but now I can't stop shaking I can't calm down. It's been two hours since I had a brief minor spill on my Microsoft Surface damage and my roommate is trying to reassure me that it's okay because my laptop is working normally as if nothing happened but I still can't calm down and I feel so sick. 

What if it's fine now but later it stops working? I'm trying to make myself believe that if there was damage it wouldn't be working right now. I'm scared. This was really expensive. My dad is going to kill me if he finds out. 

I hate this feeling. I don't even know if this is the right sub for this. I already posted to r/laptops inquiring if my laptop would be okay and describing what happened in greater detail and  I'm thinking maybe this post belongs in r/rant. 

I need to calm down but I can't. I don't know what's wrong with me. I've never felt like this for such a long time - two hours! Usually I begin to calm down before that point. I'm thinking maybe spilling water on my laptop released some trigger that let loose a bunch of other issues I was having and gave me an excuse to freak out. 

But besides that, I'm worried for my laptop. I've checked all of it's functions (I.e. sound, typing, touchscreen, etc.) and it appears to be working normally but I'm terrified. 

I just need to be told to calm down in a non forceful manner. I feel like people get annoyed with me and just want to tell me to shut up and stop acting mental. 

I don't know what to do. I don't feel like I have anyone to talk to right now. I called my roommate but I feel like she doesn't care that I'm freaking out. My teeth are chattering, they do that when I get nervous, or whatever this is. I tried to reach out to my friend but she hasn't responded and I just want someone who won't be fake with me and who will honestly care about what I'm feeling. I want to feel supported. I've been close with my friend since freshman year of high school, but sometimes I feel like I'm not connecting. 

I just need to talk to someone and hear their voice or just know that they really care. I hate being in these situations and not having anyone like that. I feel so alone.  

None of this makes sense. I'm falling apart, and my second semester of college begins Monday. I don't know if I can handle any of this anymore. It's like one thing happens and it sets me off and I start projecting how I feel about one instance on everything and I keep imagining the worst scenarios. I want to know that my laptop will be okay. (Any tech people here, let's chat about what happened? I'm concerned.) I want to know I'll be okay. Like during my life. I want to know that I find a good career and a good man and have children and am happy. 

I'm gonna stop this dumb ranting now. I can't believe I spilled water on my laptop. I'm a wreck. Not even sure if this is the right sub for this, probably not.

"Tips for getting over this anxiety ""trigger""? Not sure exactly what to call this, I guess it's a trigger but idk. 



I have really bad anxiety surrounding my cats. So much so that just typing this right now is making me tear up. I'm in my early 20s and have had 11 cats in my life including the 3 I have now. All the ones before have died from being outdoor. Hit by cars, eating by wild animals, etc. I have anxiety in general, but being such a cat lover and having had so many of them die before their time in such traumatic ways has made my anxiety really bad when it comes to worrying about my cats. I've even developed weird OCD with it where I can't have my socks match in the slightest way or a cat will die. I know that's not really true but my brains tricks me into thinking it is. 



Anyway, my mom helped me build an outdoor enclosure earlier this year when our last cat died. I had him since I was 13 and it was/still is really hard on me. I had a really strong connection with him, more so than any other cat I've had. I was finally able to convince my mom to keep our cats inside/in the enclosure, especially once she brought home a new kitten. 



It was kind of a hard transition for our other 2 cats who were used to going outside, especially Spunky who is specifically my cat. It's gotten a lot better now but he still sometimes meows to go outside. I'll just open the cat door for him so he goes into the enclosure but if my dad is home he'll let him straight outside. He usually comes back within a couple hours, but that still doesn't stop me from worrying. It was pouring rain about a week ago and he didn't come back all day/night until it was bedtime. My mom was even worried looking down the street to make sure he wasn't dead. I've asked my dad literally every single day to not let him out and he still does. I've asked so kindly and I'm ALWAYS the one cleaning the litter box and feeding them so it's not like it's any burden on my dad. He just doesn't care. 



I think I'd be able to live with this if it was once in a while and in the day time. But it's every. single. day. and he always lets him out at night for some reason?? I think he waits until I'm in my room, since I'm usually up and about during the day so he waits until I'm not around to let him out so I don't see it. But I still know it happens and I have constant anxiety until my cat comes back inside. It's really starting to drain me. I can have a really good mental health day but then this will ruin it. 



Sorry this is so long...but I'd really just like some help. My dad won't change so I guess I have to but I'm not sure how. ",Anxiety

"School / work dread Hey everyone.



Age 20, live in Canada. Have been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder for about eight years now. Have gone to tons of therapy and I take medication



I've come so far since that diagnosis eight years ago, but I still struggle of course. The main issue right now is dread about school and work



I am a university student and I constantly dread going to school. I dread all aspects of school, including the bus ride there and back, sitting in class for hours, assignments, etc. I love learning but my anxiety has me so stressed. For work, I only work about three times a month on average because the company I work for is an event company (I work as a cashier in food service for events) and I constantly dread my shifts (even though I've been there for a few years now).



Sometimes it keeps me up at night. Sometimes I start crying because I think about all the schoolwork I have to do and I feel like I can't breathe. Sometimes I feel like throwing up when I remember I have a work shift coming up. I never look forward to school or work anymore. Pretty much it feels like I get small panic attacks without the shaking I used to get. Its hard because right now school is my life so I have to find a way to deal with this feeling of hopelessness and dread. As for work, I need the money so I can't quit.



It feels like I have to drag myself to the bus stop every day for school, like I have to work consciously against myself to keep going. I've been in post secondary school for almost four years now so I should be used to it. Instead my anxiety has just gotten worse. 





Note that I am on waiting lists for counseling. 



Any advice? Thanks ",Anxiety

Ive told her about it multiple times and shes reassured me i have nothing to worry about but i hate telling her because i dont want her to think im unstable or something, she deserves someone who doesnt worry 24/7. All of this was bad enough but on boxing day i think i experienced my 1st panic attack (im not sure what it was) i was with family and i was feeling kind of down for no reason and my family kept getting me to get off the sofa on my own and come join them, i did it because i didnt wanna seem boring but after that i found myself backing into a corner, my cousins tried to get me to join in but i couldnt take it for some reason and i just ran out the door and started crying for no reason, i started hyperventilating and then after about 5 minutes i was fine.

I would much rather a guy tell me straight up he's not into me, instead of just disappearing off the face of the earth. It sucks when weeks go by and you're talking to the same person and then they drop you and stop responding to your texts. I'm wondering if this happens to anyone else?

"I got myself back In January of 2017, I had an awful encounter with a newly diagnosed mental illness I had. I'd never had a diagnosis of a specific illness before, so navigating was hard. On the day of that awful encounter, my head pushed and pushed away the most important thing in my life until I felt I'd lost it completely.

In April of 2018, for the first time in well over a year (exact days were January 9th 2017 and around April 20th 2018) I felt I had finally gotten back what I lost all that time ago, even if just for a second.

Since then, I think I've held onto my important things better and have dealt with situations better. I never thought about how big this was for me until the end of 2018. I'm horribly scared of New Years now, the anxiety of coming up to a new year just reminds me of what I lost in 2017. But we just had reached January and it's now several days in and I still feel okay.

I've always been the anxious kid and worried adult so I think it's definitely in my DNA to trend towards high strung neuroticism, but I also think an inability to relax or be okay with non-productive activities is a source of anxiety as well. I really resonated with the part about the to do list that just gets longer, the resistance to mundane-yet-complicated adulting tasks, and navigating as a millennial parent, and the expectations thrust upon you as such.

"i have something very important to complete but I get incredible anxiety around it... haven't been able to start ... I nearly graduated college this past spring but a series of unfortunate events prevented me from actually doing so.  Within the last 2 months of graduating, my creepy roommate threatened to kill me by strangling me which triggered PTSD from a past abusive relationship - a trigger that I didn't even know I had until I was too in-shock to function for weeks.  Because of this, I lost my job, had to move without any money saved, and didn't finish my last quarter of college.  

It's 7 months later now and I was able to make up 2 of the 3 classes I needed to finish by doing online courses.  However, now I am left with my senior project to complete. 

I haven't even started it.  I have tons of ideas of what to do but every time I sit down to start, I distract myself.  A few weeks ago, my senior project advisor reached out to me asking what I want to do about it since I have a set amount of time to do it before I can't do it at all and will have to re-enroll to finish my degree.  

Part of the reason I'm so anxious about it, too, is that I desperately want to go to graduate school and need it to be a good senior project so that I can have it as a sample of work.  But I don't feel like I have the support, even with my senior project advisor, to be able to create something good on my own.  I'm working full-time now (I told them I was going to get my degree sooner) in addition.  

I don't know what's keeping me from starting this.  I feel like I have control over my mental health aside from this.  It brings me so much shame and anxiety to think about.  It brings me back to how terrible the end of my senior year was and the events surrounding that, the reasons I didn't get it done in the first place.  I wish I just had someone to push me to do it but I know that, now that I'm an independent adult, I have to be the one to get it done.

The point i'm getting at is, i feel like a stupid kid, and not a 16 year old. i'm really short for a guy my age (5'5) and it hits my self-confidence pretty hard. i'm not dumb, at least i don't think. i've got decent grades and stuff, but i can't get away from this feeling. every time i get hooked on it, i irrationally want to just stop trying at everything. just kinda stop existing so i don't have to drag others down. i don't know.. it was hard to even post this because i was genuinely just going to give up on myself. and yes, i know. i'm only 16 and things get better and whatever but the point is i know many other 16 year olds who are just way better at this stuff and they seem like real people and i don't. i've never really called this anxiety, so lemme know if you think it's something else.",Anxiety

"Can GAD alone cause self injurious breakdowns? (TW for self harm mentions) I'm diagnosed with mild GAD and OCD traits. Ever since I can remember, I've had pretty bad breakdowns every now and then, usually triggered by frustration and occasionally by anxiety (over exams, social gatherings etc), but the ones from frustration are much worse. I started throwing myself on the ground as a child, around three years old, then stopped and started getting the impulse to hit myself. It got worse lately. If I could, I'd break something or punch something else, but doing it to myself is more immediate and less damaging. When I'm in this state, I also yell at people furiously. It's a purely physical instinct to let out the anger and frustration more than the anxiety, anger over things not being how they should, over unexpected events. It's like I feel so much over so little that my body can't contain it, I can only express frustration through violence, that's the only way I can do it, because just vocalizing it would never be enough. It's too strong for words, it's too strong to just cry and do nothing else.

I have to say that after a couple years of therapy, I rarely get the classic GAD symptoms, more than anything I fall into obsessive thought cycles that can lead to self harm out of frustration. However these breakdowns are very rarely linked to feelings of anxiety itself - when I feel anxious I can't do anything, I just feel sick and struggle to breathe.

Can GAD alone cause this type of breakdowns or should I seek help to get tested for some other disorder?",Anxiety

"Feel like I'm on the edge of having a panic attack Okay, so I have dealt with anxiety and panic attacks for quite some time now. This past week / month, however, it's been worse. I have had a constant feeling of anxiety and for the past day or two I've also had the feeling that a really bad panic attack is coming.

That feeling tends to become a self-fulfilling prophecy, especially since some of my panic attacks have been really bad (I've had one that lasted over an hour) resulting in a fear of having one. At the moment none of the people that are capable of getting me out of a panic attack are around so I just cannot afford to have one.

"I had my first anxiety attack in almost two months, and I??m proud. I suffer from anxiety, and panic attacks followed by desrealization. Basically, I feel like I\`m in a dream, and nothing of reality is true. It went too far once, leaving me lying in my bed for 1 hour, shaking and feeling that I was in a dream, and in ""the reality"", something very, very bad was happening to me. So I decided to see a psychiatrist. He made me understand that it??s something very normal, and that I??m not going crazy (thank fucking jesus, I was very afraid of that). He gave me antidepresives (looks like panic attacks start depression on people) , and anxiolytics. 



I been feeling very OK, until I saw Bandersnatch with a friend. You know, that Black Mirror movie. In the movie, they talk a lot about drugs, reality, control, etc. EVERY thing that triggers my panic attacks. I took and anxiolytic, and went to bed, because I was starting to shake a lot.



A few days ago, I decided to see the movie, alone. I said to myself ""I want to fight this shit"", and watched it. I made every decision related to my panic attacks, on purpose. And I felt fine. I knew it was just a movie, and actually, a good one. My fears are just fears. I??m not in a dream, a coma, or anything like that. I??m in real life and I just suffer from panic attacks. Fuck that shit. I just have to keep fightning, take my pills, go to the psychiatrist once or twice a month, and everything will return to normal. 



Yeah, it??s a stupid thing. Just a movie. But it scared me a lot. And I went for more, and won some of my fears. And I??m very proud of that. And I had to share it with you.

"Wife's depression still causing anxiety attacks after she got better For the last decade or so I've had anxiety attacks, some milder than others and time in between varying. It was usually busy/loud places doing the trick. But in the last year they've been worse/more frequent, and I've begun to realize events in my marriage could be cause. 

I met my wife when working in the US for a while, and when moving back we did LDR until we got married and she moved here - leaving everything behind.

The first number of months are generally very boring after moving - you don't know anyone, you can't work, ... This can all work into your mood, and so it did for her. So I tried to be there a much as possible, do everything I can for her. Try to get her past the ""I'll NEVER be able to find a job here"" days.
But yes, she found a job, where she felt good at first, her co-workers seemed nice, ... But after some time she started noticing toxic behavior in the office, which she tried to bring up to management and fell completely onto deaf ears. It got increasingly worse and she ended up staying home with burn out and depression. Luckily I convinced her to go to our doctor.

Good days where she was the sweetest girl you could wish for could suddenly change into days of depression, triggered by e.g. something not going according to plan, missing out on something, feel pressured to do something, ...
I tried whatever I could think of to help, but usually she wouldn't accept help - nothing was good/right and she couldn't sleep because of overthinking. She didn't want anyone to know anything, not even her family. I was walking on eggshells and I'd start to increasingly feel helpless.
This depression went deeper and longer with every episode, and eventually she started being suicidal. At one point I even caught her wanting to swallow a bunch of sleeping pills but got to her before she was able to. Probably important to note that my mother once attempted suicide this way when I was younger.

My feeling of helplessness started causing bad anxiety attacks, have constant stomach aches, lost weight, ... I also had to live with the knowledge that if she decided anything while I was at work, there's nothing I could have done - she's a diabetic so it would just be a matter of injecting too much insulin.
Eventually, after her contract ended with that company, and when she discovered that multiple other people left the company and/or had burn outs, she felt validated in her feelings and started getting better and better.

These days she's her old optimistic, happy self again. But I still can't help having anxiety attacks when something happens that previously could have triggered an episode of depression, but now she shrugs off.
I haven't told her about this, as I'm afraid she'll feel guilty. She's an amazing, caring person who deserves the happiness she's finally found again.

"When your anxiety strikes back... Hey! 
Posting here for different reasons. For a couple of days now my anxiety is back. Not as bad as it can be but... mainly high anxiety right when I get up and more or less a constant tension all day long.
I wanted to post it because I know how to stop it but I'm kinda stuck.
My anxiety is linked to loneliness/low self-esteem. I've been moving around a lot and recently moved to a new place. I basically don't  have good friends and mainly old distant friends just on facebook. I feel quite easily lonely and feel crap because I can't get good friends nor keep my previous ones. 

I did meet someone who became quickly my girlfriend. We've been together for 2 months now but it has been far from great. 

The 31st triggered everything. Despite knowing I would be alone my gf didn't invite my with her friends. When she realised that I was getting overwhelmingly low she decided to cancel to be with me... out of pity and not to feel like an asshole (her words). I did manage to spend my night with unknown people and it was a much better night than expected. 

Here is the problem. I know I'm not happy with her. Since we are together she lowered my self esteem, increased my insecurity. Because of the 31st it got weird on her side. I'm anxious at the idea of being dumped, I'm anxious at the idea of breaking up with her. I'm so scared of being lonely. 

I've been in the same position 7 months ago so I know what I should do but I can't.

"Every day that I fail to get over my anxiety I get more convinced that my brain is just hardwired to live in constant dread.

It's like being on a rollercoaster in that moment right before a giant drop, except the feeling of that moment has lasted for years.



The fact that my brain does this on it's own, and there's nothing I can do nothing about it pisses me off immensely.

"29 [M] First supposed anxiety 'episode' This is my first post here, and it's a post I never really saw myself making. To my disbelief, I've recently been told by multiple doctors that I have anxiety.

Two weeks ago I had a normal day at the start of my Christmas holidays. At the end of the day I kicked back and played a few games with some friends online. I noticed about an hour into gaming my vision was blurring a wee bit. I thought, ""Well, that's strange"", and I packed the game in and went to bed. Pretty much as soon as I hit the mattress I felt shaking/tremors coming on and noticed I felt feint in the chest with a pulsating heart-beat. It's a feeling I'd never felt before. This pretty much continued all night, during which I found it hard to remain calm because of what was physically happening to me.  It very gradually subsides the next day.



The next day I went to see my doctor. He did some regular checks like blood pressure and listening to my heart, but played it down and said it could be the flu. Basically wait it out. This didn't sit right with me, especially because I felt 100% most of that day, and I've had the flu - it doesn't feel like that. I demanded blood work and an ectrocardiography test. I had those tests done and they indicate I'm healthy.



Fast forward 2 weeks later. I've been enjoying time with family and put that episode behind me. At this point, I put it off as a one-off event - maybe the doctor was right, it could have been the flu. I sense it creeping in again. This time I'm surrounded by family and starting to feel the same physiological effects. Shivering, pulsating heart-beat, feeling faint. Again, it lasts all night and into the next day. It very gradually subsides.



OK, now I'm convinced something is wrong with me. I saw a doctor today and he was pretty much convinced I was experiencing anxiety related symptoms. This doesn't make sense to me especially because 1. I'm a healthy individual (pride myself with gym/exercise/eating habits, 2. I've never experienced this before in my life, and here I am at 29, 3. I can't think of anything overbearing in my personal life that could be the root cause (not ruling out something majorly subconscious but I can't find anything).

"Relationship anxiety - how to progress First time poster here. I am 30F and have had anxiety issues for most of my life - which escalated until I was medicated from 2013. 

My history with relationships is not fantastic. I've not had a long term relationship since I was 20 and with each relationship I do have which subsequently crashes and burns my anxiety about them increase, which in turn leads to more problems in relationships going forwards. 

I started dating someone [29M] November last year, and warned them explicitly that Christmas and New Years are really hard times for me. SAD is a big player, the extra sensory stimulation around. In addition I have never had a relationship survive over Christmas even prior to the other factors.  They know about that later aspect but not about the underlying brain chemistry issues. 

Due to living in different cities and his being busy we haven't seen each other since before Christmas and only really contact via text message, but this is every day. This hasn't been an issue before but over the past couple of weeks, as my anxiety has been skyrocketing, I have become more defensive, passive and sarcastic in textual language. I know this simply means that it is not the best form of communication, phone calls would be more appropriate and I am trying to introduce that but it may already be too late - he snapped at me this morning about it (to be fair he has flu). 

I am trying to deal as best as I can with getting through the month. I have found working helps and so I went back to work early. I had taken time off over Christmas but having that time to myself and my own mind really did not work.  Going to the gym as well did wonders but that is short term - and less practical this week due to the early January influx. I have invested in an SAD light and I am being stringent with that. I am trying to be kind to myself. And finally I am going to Australia in two weeks to get some much needed sun. 

My question really is does anyone have any advice as to how I can manage this? I would love to be in a relationship with someone and I don't struggle to necessarily meet people - OLD primarily as I like to get to know someone's personality - I don't find men attractive based on looks alone at all. But it's just actually getting through the first few months just alludes me. When do I introduce the fact that there is a problem? Is there any coping strategies that people have found helpful?

I've been improving my social skills for some time and I went from not knowing what to say to going very deep with someone , even if sometimes I don't pick the right moments for that ( lack of social intelligence I suppose )

I have something that no one knows -  excepts two friends , and are these shakings and blockages that I have in my body . I've been searching for a long time about this but I cannot find a definite answer 

When I'm in places where there's people , my neck starts to shake af and my body feels blocked . This always happens when I'm near a girl , but not when I'm around one that I know ( ex : school girls ) 

Even if I improved my social skills , this uncontrollable and unreasonable shaking is always there . Sometimes I feel my throat or chest blocked , sometimes not only my neck shakes but also the rest of my body 

I come from an abusive family and that made me repress my sexuality ( but even before that repression I felt this ) . I sometimes wanted to talk with girls in the street and it was a draining experience  , I simply couldn't do it

This is specifically related to teeth though. 
TLDR@ end.

Along with the general dreams that I have probably twice a week about my teeth falling, breaking, decaying, no one helping everyone laughing, not being able to speak or eat, everything imaginable, I'm also becoming increasing concerned that those fears are because my gums are receding and my teeth are going to fall out irl. I have an activated charcoal tooth powder that I've been using to help fight yellowing (drink a lot of coffee), and my teeth feel clean, but my gums look pale. Maybe I'm sick with something else but he powder could be bleaching my gums which is fine but I feel like I can see more of my tooth than I'm supposed to. I also chipped one of my front teeth recently and that's been more and more a source worry. I'm also concerned the chipped top is changing the way my teeth fit together and bringing back my underbite and undoing all the work my braces did. I'm terrified of the dentist every since I got my wisdom teeth out, the stitches situation there was terrible. In high school I went through a phase where I was brushing my teeth four and five times a day as a control thing related to other anxieties/issues. I've also been told I'm a perfectionist and I'm very vain so my teeth matter because people will look at them and judge me. Help?
 
TLDR- long history with teeth insecurities including anxiety dreams about tooth damage etc, but now I'm actually concerned all my teeth will fall out, too afraid of the dentist...need guidance. ",Anxiety

"Cardiophobic husband may be the death of me. The past 8 years has been filled with hospitals, doctors and pills. A lot of mental anguish and anxiety in between. My husband never had a major health problem. In fact, he was the type of guy to push himself when he was too sick to do so. Then he had a heart attack, a real bad one. 

It was a piece of plaque that had broken off and traveled to his heart. It caused a great deal of pain and scared the living shit out of him, which is understandable. When he was released from the hospital, he was sent home with hardly no meds and no real change in diet or exercise. 

During the months that followed, he started paying attention to his heart more. More attention than I knew was humanely possible. By now he tells me he can feel the blood flow thru the valves and feels when his heart rhythm changes. This is insane to me because I don't even know mines beating unless my bp is elevated. Then he started having chest pains. 

Being new to all of this, I call an ambulance. We get to the hospital and that's where things get weird. When asked, he claims his pain lvl is a 10. I've seen him at a 10, this is a 3 at best. His ekg doesn't look ""right"" but the other test results are unremarkable. They always sent him on to a cardiac care hospital just in case. 2-3 days of tests with nothing found to be wrong, he's sent home.

The next 6 years of my life was consumed by heart issues that only he could feel and weren't detectable by any test. Over and over the same ol pains show up and we are in the hospital again. I have had my fill and let his cardiologist know, husband sitting right there. Doc says ""ok, next time you come in with these symptoms and we can't find a cause, we are going to open you up."" And, just like that, the pains stopped. 

Fast forward 2 years, he starts having pains again. But, this time I can tell he's truly in trouble and call an ambulance. The EMTs and hospital staff are even jaded by his shit by now. They send him to the bigger hospital where they find 2 blockages and put stents in them. 

Now, he's scared to get his heart rate up for any reason. He pushes himself to be at rest so bad, he never leaves the couch, like ever. His life has completely come to a halt. The chest pains have now returned which led us to another hospital visit.

This time they found pneumonia but nothing cardiac related. But that hasn't stopped him from driving an entire PLUMONARY floor insane. The cardiac response team has been called in at least twice daily because of chest pains that are over before the morphine has a chance to help. I'm no doctor, but I'm pretty sure pneumonia can cause some chest discomfort too.

I know he can't help it and doesn't mean to drive me insane. In his mind, he is truly in danger, but I can't deal with all this again. What can I do and what should I avoid? Where does my 20 years of experience studying this man come into play? What rights do I have in his care? How do I care for my own mental health?",Anxiety

"I feel like I'm in a deep hole and a mess sometimes due to anxiety. Sorry its such a long and ranty post but I just feel like I need to write here. I'm a 22 year old guy (on an anonymous throwaway account). A college student who feels like I'm not going anywhere in life due to the anxiety I have. I got about 1 year left (should have graduated last summer if i didn't change my major as a sophomore) and am not ready to graduate in my opinion and it's a waste.

I have always struggled since I was young to communicate, start conversations, or relate well to others that aren't in my immediate family. I don't really have any friends, never had any girlfriends, never even had a real job of any kind due to the thought of having to interact with people all day, as well as fear of getting fired easily for not being a great communicator and messing up, or fear of blowing it in the interview, even though I know I'm a hard worker. 

I have been making a bit of money to support myself by flipping mainly electronics locally for the past 2 years using mainly my financial aid money though but it probably won't count on my already lacking resume since it wasn't under a real job. I do have a few things on it like school volunteering for a year and a club I was a part of but haven't been able to attend in the past few months due to moving far. I did put the bit about selling things for 2 years as self employed but think I should remove it now.

Things haven't been going as well lately with reselling and due to not being classified as a ""full time"" student, my financial aid was significantly cut to the point I get no extra money besides money for class and as a result I had to move in with my parents this school year after my last apartment lease was up since I can't afford to live on my own with no random roommates and have no proof of income. I was sharing an apartment with a family member but they decided to move somewhere with a friend this year. I do help by offering to pay my parents a bit of rent each month &amp; am fairly independent (I know how to cook a bit, I do my share of chores mainly without being asked, my own laundry, etc.) so it's not like I live here as a waste of space. 

I get pressured a bit by my mom to find a real job but sometimes I don't think she understands what goes through my head. I feel like to her it's something that should magically happen over night. I actually applied to a few different places but no response to most and even one rejection email (possibly due to my lacking resume). I feel limited to where I can work since I can't drive due to a minor disability and live where transportation is not reliable.

I also don't know where to even start for what to do after college, while I hear my peers are getting internships and are already a few jobs in. My school has career services and even many counselling and other help services for things such as anxiety but I still feel nervous and or embarrased get help. I just go to school &amp; go home after, barely saying a word to anyone or anyone saying a word to me. It feels depressing and monotonous after a while.

I made it clear I didn't want sexual advances and that I'm not a trained professional. My anxiety prevents me from revealing too much about myself. I have self confidence issues.

I was met with sexual advances. Some of which turned threatening when I said no. I had people comment, comparing me to perverts. Some called me names.

"What to expect at first doctors appointment? So I've been suffering with anxiety and depression symptoms for over 3 years now and I've convinced myself that this is due to work related stuff.

He has done some blood work and concluded thah I was under stress and I should change jobs. Not very helpful.

"Mirtazapine and weight gain So my anxiety has been crazy this past month at the point that I just don't sleep anymore. The only drug that worked on anxiety and depression for a while was mirtazapine (remeron) but it made me gain so much weight ... I developped anorexia nevrosa while taking it. I was later introduced to lamotrigine and started taking it along with mirt. I had a bit more energy and I think my apetite was less strong but I had a few bulimic episodes. I don't know if my weight was doing ok because of control or because of lamotrigine. Aside from that the combination was working well for me, my sleep was great my anxiety manageable. But I had a panic attack about the weight stuff (you don't get rid of eating disorders easily ...) and stopped it cold turkey. I slept less but felt less tired (tbh i was staying home all day) .

"Anyone else's anxiety feels more intense than just anxiety? I miss the days when anxiety just meant butterflies in my stomach before a speech or talking to a guy I liked.

For the past 3 years, I panic over just about anything. I'm *slowly* trying to getting a grip on it but it makes it so hard to do anything. In all social events, I start getting shaky and my limbs feel weak. I hate when people pass me things because my arms are all wobbly and shaky, including my voice. My voice becomes faint when this panic comes on. People look so concerned when they look at me but they're nice enough to not say anything though. I recently got a job after not working for almost a year. My last job I was having such bad panic attacks it felt like I was having heart attacks to the point I couldnt speak or move. One time during rush hour I ran to the back of the kitchen while there was a long line.. I felt so bad for my coworkers. They didn't understand that kind of anxiety and I guess I don't blame them. I'm holding it together for the most part at my current job but I catch myself getting the symptoms.

I always have a sense of fear hovering over me. This anxiety makes me clumsy, tremors, manual breathing, and talk like I had a stroke. When I'm nervous I catch myself holding my breathe and idk why I do that but it happens a lot. By the time I catch myself doing it, my head &amp; hearts racing and I'm far from my center. I work in retail and when the anxiety gets that point it feels like my hands don't function. I'll try ringing people up but my hands barely have enough strength to lift/grip their products ? and they're not heavy at all. My doctor prescribed me propranolol for the heart racing but I try not to depend on it. I've had MRI's for the stroke-like speech and tremors but everything was healthy.

2 semesters ago I prepared a speech for a class assignment.. I literally froze and started shaking infront of everyone. I want to cry thinking about it.

I quit self harm but sometimes the anxiety gets so bad it's all I can think about. When I'm in public I feel only safe in my sunglasses and headphones so I can get to my destination at ease. Sometimes in public I forget how to walk because I'm so self conscious. Is anyone going through this intense type of panic? Its like I'm worried I'm screwing up.

"Why do people ring when they can just text? I associate all phone calls with emergencies and urgent situations. Also, people who have insisted on calling me in the past have actually called instead of sending a written message because they know it's easier to manipulate me if they're speaking to me. If they send a written message, I have time to write a well thought-out reply and can't be caught off-guard. Certain people have called me because writing is more my forte but it's not theirs. They choose the terms of the engagement by calling me when seeking to manipulate me. Of course I'm not going to answer if I know this is their real motive for calling!

It bugs me that friends know I hate answering calls because of my anxiety and previous experiences with frequent, manipulative callers. I've had the same number for years and get a lot of scam calls as well. Why do my friends still call me for non-urgent reasons? Like asking me when I will get somewhere? That is easily done via text or Facebook messenger. There's no logic to calling someone when they're late for something either, as wasting their time talking to them when you don't need to just makes them even later. Texting/messaging saves time and is far less anxiety provoking.

Getting calls from work and family I can deal with. But getting frequent calls from friends for no reason really bugs me. I get anxious every time I see/feel my phone ringing (I keep it on vibrate, of course).

"Is there a name for what I'm dealing with? Need some advice. Hi everyone.

This is my first post here. I'm not perfectly sure if my question fits with the subreddit but it doesn't hurt to ask.

By no means I'm asking for some kind of diagnosis. I just want to hear your opinion on something I've been dealing with for a long time now. Many years, actually.

When I was in high school (around 6 years ago) I started dealing with random anxiety attacks in that I would fixate on a stressing thought for days to the point where I'd even experience a panic attack. That led me to visit a therapist during the last year of high school.

The therapist confirmed that I had some form of anxiety, probably an anxiety disorder, but he was never very clear about it. I went a few times and then stopped because I found him mediocre.

For these past 3 years or so, I don't deal with panic attacks but I have a different form of the issue I described. I basically overanalyse things, almost all day. In most cases, they are things that I might feel uncomfortable about thinking. Not necessarily taboo or offensive. Just a tad bit inappropriate. And the thing is that If I avoid the overanalysation I start feeling stressed. As if I haven't completed something important. As if I have to do it, otherwise my day won't be right. It certainly isn't tremendous stress but it is annoying. 

Do you have any idea what could be causing this? Is there a name for it? Is it something specific? I can't afford to go to a therapist in the meantime so I guess just having a possibly clearer picture of what I might be having would make feel a bit better.

In group call, one of us reads the book out loud to listeners. Sometimes we brainstorm since it helps to apply the advice given in the book. If you are interested in joining, PM me about your level of depression/anxiety, country (for timezone purposes), about yourself (just to check if you are not a psycho or weirdo) and if you have snapchat or discord. 

Why should you join? If you are too depressed to do anything, if you are procrastinating, if you are lost, if you feel bad, someone reading this book to you can help you.

Why I'm doing this? I'm too depressed to read a book about depression alone. My attention span also got shorter due to anxiety. Doing this with others makes me somehow accountable and I feel like I'm doing something good for myself.

"I would not wish an anxiety disorder on my worst enemy I am on mobile in bed, so excuse any formatting errors. 
My anxiety disorder has steadily been getting worse over the past few months. I have made a doctor's appointment for next week so I will be able to figure out where to go from the point I'm at, hopefully some therapy will be involved.
I can't eat anything without stomach pain. My stomach feels like it's permanently in knots. I have diagnosed IBS and it makes eating nearly impossible. But, when I don't eat I am dizzy and acid builds up in my stomach. It's a vicious cycle.
I have been having anxiety at night that I can't pin point the cause of. 
I see other 23 year olds out with friends, having a good time and I can't do these things. I am going on a weekend get away less than an hour away from my home and I am incredibly worried. I am only gone one night but I am still very worried.

"Taking a trip with agoraphobia So I've dealt with generalized anxiety with agoraphobia for a few years now. This started out as just getting anxious in traffic which evoked the psychosomatic symptoms of nausea and need to escape. It turned into fear of driving to a location that i couldn't retreat or be helped from (people in my family have agoraphobia). It also turned into emetophobia, vomiting freaks me out. 

Thus, I've been limited to the degree of where I go, spend time, and drive. 

Nevertheless, a band that i enjoy is playing a show in the city, which i haven't been to in 4 years before this all developed. I bought a ticket and figure I'll use motivation as my way to kick agoraphobia. I'm unsure of whether or not I'll drive with some friends, take mass transit, Uber, or allow someone else to drive. All of the above are going to be tough for me. 

I have thought about using systematic desensitization and either driving a little bit further daily (or taking the train one more exit) leading up to the show, but i was wondering if anyone had some other ideas of how i can prepare for this! ",Anxiety

"How to minimize side effects? Hey guys, this is my first post on here ever and I am not sure where else to go as I have already talked to a Dr about this. I was put on Zoloft for my GAD in November starting at 25mg. I felt fine but thought I maybe needed a little more so talked to my Dr and they upped the dose to 50mg. Since I started taking the 50mg I have had awful, frequent diarrhea. Non stop. I kept on the dose for a month with the hopes that it would subside. I was in the bathroom upwards of 4 times a day. Before this I rarely had more than one bowel movement a day. I tried taking Imodium, it did not help. I tried Pepto, it helped a tiny bit but not enough. I tried taking the Zoloft after eating rather than on an empty stomach. Kind of helped but not much. Finally talked to the Dr again, and he had to switch to Celexa 20mg. I am still shitting my guts out. I know Zoloft takes a few days to leave the system but I have chapped my skin and made my asshole bleed from the constant wiping...  I'm sorry this is super gross and tmi but I'm seriously considering stopping the meds just so I don't continue to hurt myself.

"My own personal savior I recently have come to a breakthrough point in regards to my anxiety. We all worry so much about the future and subconsciously predict negative versions of future situations without even fully realizing it. However, your body reacts to it as if this imaginary threat were real, creating the physical sensation of anxiety.

After about five+ years of suffering from anxiety I have FINALLY found a strategy that works for me at almost any time, any place. and can reduce my symptoms by up to 90%. This method is as follows:

Become mindful of when you become anxious. Whenever you feel your body starting to tense up, this typically means an anxious spell is beginning, even if you aren't fully aware of what you are anxious of at the time.

Upon noticing the sensation, immediately tell yourself in a neutral, detached tone I cannot predict the future. I don't know what will happen, literally anything could happen.

After this, focus on a future even that you are maybe feeling anxious about (walking into a meeting at work that you are nervous for) and imagine yourself feeling totally calm, competent, and performing in a successful way. 

Being able to tell yourself that you don't know what will happen is the priming for allowing the anxious emotions to lose their power, then focusing on a positive outcome for a situation (where you are anxiety-free and achieving your goal easily) will help to effectively replace the anxious thought with a positive one. 

This has been working wonders for me. While it is not a permanent fix, it has reduced my symptoms of anxiety (and in turn depression) dramatically over the past few days. My goal is to get this style of thought to become a habit. I honestly feel much more relaxed believing that I don't know what will happen rather than trying to predict negative versions of situations. 

TLDR: when you're feeling anxious tell yourself you cannot predict the future and then immediately focus on situations you're anxious for working out, as well as you feeling calm and confident.",Anxiety

"Who's Approval Are You Looking For? I was about to visit my family back home for the first time since I moved away. I had a really terrible panic attack the day before my flight. I couldn't breathe, I started crying uncontrollably, and I really didn't want to go. 

During the trip, my family was judgemental and I relived everything I wanted to leave. It wasn't all bad, but I was more uncomfortable than not. I was able to see my best friend while I was there. She was able to come with us to look at Christmas lights and she mentioned that she was mad. She was mad at the way my family was talking to me and I didn't even know what she was referring to. This is how much I needed a change in my life. I didn't even recognize the kind of language my family was using that made me feel the way I did before I moved. 

When I got back home, my wonderful boyfriend and I went to church for the first time in probably 9 months. Now I'm not here to convert anyone, but rather share the wonderful comfort that I got from the message that Sunday. I never felt like I was enough for my family and they always shared their love for me in such a weird way that I rarely felt it in the way I felt from others. The message I heard for so long was one that I finally understood. That God loves me and that I am enough. 

I could tell you in what ways I felt about all of this, but I also understood that there was nothing I could do to earn any MORE of God's love. It's been a long time for me going through these changes to realize that I had been trying to get everyone's approval around me. I was looking for approval from friends, family members, people who are supposed to be supportive of me, and I had no idea.

"why am i like this so i have anxiety, like everyone here, but im only 15 y/o. and im so worried abt it getting worse bc sometimes I cant leave my bed in my breakdowns. i get worried that im easily replaced, so i become clingy in hopes others dont forget me, and this just causes them to not like me and this becomes  a vicious cycle. not too mention the fact i feel like im not good enough for anyone and im just wasting people's time? and i fear that it'll only get worse as time goes on. my family tries to help but i can't share this with anyone and im always reluctant to take anything, so i was hoping you guys could help me get through this",Anxiety
"I don't know how to cope. I'm 22(m) and I have go completely blank and numb whenever I try and process things that happened to me as a child. There's really no easy way to say it, I was molested as a kid. By an uncle over a period of about 2 years. About a year ago my anxiety began to flare out of control and take over my life. I went to a therapist and was diagnosed with cPTSD and along with the therapy many different bad memories of my childhood resurfaced. I dissociated as a child,  as my only means of protecting myself from the things that had happened to me. And now as an adult it's happening again whenever the thoughts drown my head. I want to be able to put it behind me, and cope with it properly. Idk why I decided to post this on reddit, maybe it's because I'm looking for advice or maybe i just need to vent it.

"The Anxiety Cure Anxiety comes from Desire.



Do you have anxiety over death?



That comes from a desire to live.



It often comes from thinking about what you don't Desire.



Meaning, you desire the exact opposite of what you're thinking about.



But because you're thinking about what you don't want, it causes the experience called Anxiety.



Anxiety is cured by overcoming the Desire that is causing it.



Having anxiety over death?



Let go of all the reasons that you want to live.



Suddenly, death isn't some bad experience because you no longer have anything to lose if it happens.



But... that's easier said than done, right?

"Anxiety for the future and past mistakes Hey guys, 
So about a month ago my boyfriend and I were on a break due to him not being sure if he wanted to continue being in a relationship with someone (me) who is anxious all the time. During the break, I finally sought out help and I ended up being able to change most of my outlook so far. We got back together because he felt like we are making a stride to a positive direction. 
I'll be visiting him soon in a couple of days for 2 weeks and I'm extremely nervous of making the same mistakes again. Disappointing him and myself in the long run, and also giving in to my intrusive thoughts and such. Sometimes throughout the day, I think about how I wish I did not act a certain way or I hope I don't continue it after seeing him again. 
I'm just using this post as a way to vent it all out, but any words of encouragement are welcomed. ",Anxiety

"my snow driving anxiety has gotten out of hand howdy friends. my anxiety surrounding snow driving went from like, a normal and manageable level of fear these past three maine winters to a 10/10 this winter. it's been, in a word, awful. 

i only usually need to drive to and from work (20 minutes away via backroads). i also drive myself to and from school several times a week, but i can take the bus there if necessary. i plan to do that more this semester. anyways, even this minimal amount of driving has almost become too much for me. 

this is my first winter in my new to me vehicle, whereas i spent the other winters in my older first car. however, even though my current car is much newer and mechanically sound, it's *awful* in snow and ice compared to my old car. toward the tail end of last winter i had just gotten the car and rearended someone (albeit verrry gently) because the brakes didn't engage with the tires in time when it was slushy out. it's very light and the studs on the winter tires are worn, but i dont have the money to spend on new tires. 

on thanksgiving my boyfriend and i were driving to his parents' home (usually an hour and a half away) when it started snowing like crazy. we slowed to 30 on the interstate, almost a whiteout, and i was hyperventilating and couldn't drive anymore so we got on a back highway but it was even worse. i went to turn and we slid and almost spun out and i just pulled over and started sobbing and panicking even more. we had to leave my car at a gas station and have his parents pick us up. 

ever since then i just haven't been able to do it. i obsessively check the forecast and make plans around the slightest chance of snow. i've had to have coworkers and friends give me rides home from work like 3-4 times since then when the weather was unexpected. i've had crying breakdowns at work twice when i see it begin to snow. i've almost cried and panicked just backing out of my boyfriend's slightly icy driveway. 

most of my coworkers are sympathetic and kind but it must seem so irrational honestly. like, we live in maine, deal with it. everyone is used to it and drives with minimal fear or complaining, even with cars like mine. but i just can't. i get so down on myself and feel like such a useless baby who is a burden on people. idk why i made this post because it's just a rant but i just want someone to tell me my fear is valid and it's gonna be okay and that it's not stupid to be afraid...anyone relate?

Second of all, exams. Second semester of Senior Year is when all my International Baccalaureate exams and papers are. I never do well under tight time constraints, but don't qualify for extra time due to my diagnosis of GA being ""provisional"" by my high school counselor. 

Thirdly, I need a good journal software (with password feature) for Windows 10. My goal for 2019 (starting ASAP) is to have a journal entry every day that talks about the good and bad things that happen to me daily so I can look back in December and see how my year was.

"Can't convince myself it's not an arrhythmia I've had 3 episodes over the last 2 years that medical professionals call panic attacks but I'm having a hard time being convinced.

These episodes all come from me having a rapid heartbeat. This has ranged from 110 bpm to 150 bpm (the 150 bpm was during a severe bout of the stomach flu). 

I become acutely aware that my heart is beating faster and I have the immediate OH NO I'M DYING thought which triggers a whole host of symptoms including dizziness, chills, my face, hands and feet going numb and much more. 

Eventually the major symptoms subside, but my heart rate takes hours or days to decrease (which is gradually does).

Its just bad luck that I've had such bad experiences with accommodation. I have a severe fear of mice and rats and I lived in a mouse ridden apartment when I was 18. The fear of them was so intense that my best friend had to sleep at mine for months on end as I could only sleep with him near me. When I moved here I was actually homeless for two weeks due to bedbugs in my flat. I moved from that place and I'm now in a houseshare with other people. I've not actually seen any mice or bedbugs for the two months I've lived here and I was sleeping soundly until I got back here a few days ago. This house is filthy and im constantly scared that a mouse is in my room. I turn the light on at the slightest noise and I sit scanning all corners of the room. When I do finally convince myself to sleep I toss and turn because I imagine bed bugs crawling on me and biting me. My skin gets itchy and I scratch myself raw. I think this is psychological and I'm really struggling as I work long hours and have to be awake early.

I am new to r/Anxiety and reddit in general, have also posted in r/ROCD as I suffer from ocd and compulsions linked to dating and relationships. 

Just thought I'd post something here tho about my anxiety because i've been having such a hard time recently and sometimes it helps to know people can relate / that it won't be like this forever. 

I moved back to my home country after a great year away studying in central Europe and ever since then I have been in the lowest most depressed mood. I have experienced generalised anxiety before and used to even experience panic attacks but never have felt so apathetic and unmotivated and disinterested. 

I have moved back to my parents house just for this year whilst i finish off my degree. I have a very complicated home situation with my parents who have marital issues but there is a lot of stonewalling - we don't really talk about it all or acknowledge emotions etc. I can't move out til the end of my degree because of money. I have been taking an SSRI for the depressed mood and I am back in therapy doing CBT. 

I'm just really struggling, I find it hard to concentrate on conversations with friends, struggle to find activities I actually enjoy, I can't even cry because of how emotionally blocked i feel, and I experience disassociation almost daily where I feel like I'm watching a show. I just don't feel myself at all. That said, I'm still doing sport, going to uni and meeting deadlines. It's just everything else socially that I am finding super super hard.

So, can anyone else relate? Does anyone have any tips on what to do? I understand that until I move out I'm going to be affected by the negative environment I live in but I just feel so helpless as not even the ssri seems to be doing much, and it's horrible to feel so unreal all the time.

Feel so fucking isolated especially since most of my friends are away (international students, went home) and my partner's also working and lives really far from me so I barely see them too.
Working 9-5.30 i dread every single moment of that 8.5 hours, and am so sick of pretending to be okay in front of the people. And then when i get home, I'm all alone and I start dreading the next day again. Come the weekend, i start dreading the next work day again. So i'm constantly feeling like this and it's so tiring to be dreading and crying every single day.

People's been telling me to make some friends but that's also fucking hard with social anxiety and I dont know if I can even tell them about what I'm going through because no one there understands (im the only new person)
I feel so scared and so sad every single day and I'm so sick of it.
I'm currently on valium and am trying meditation under my GP's advice but while the valium's reduced my panic attacks, my chest is still so fucking tight and the dread is still so real and i'm still fucking sad. I'm also using my partner as a clutch and literally just been having them on my phone on call throughout my whole work day (we don't talk, i just listen to their background noise to provide me some comfort that someone's there).

Literally all i want is to quit and stop this but i know i shouldn't but i really want to.
People have also been saying to just stick it out for at least three months so i can get used to the environment but that's literally the length of the internship and each day already feels so long and so hard.

I just made an appointment with a psychologist for next week and I really hope i'm able to stick it out at least till then to get their advice, considering how every day's just so fucking hard.

"Anxiety... Hello,



This is going to be long. So I'll put the questions up front.

1. At this point I wouldn't mind getting checked out, but just the thought of going to the hospital sends me into a spiral.
2. Do these symptoms really seem like general anxiety?

I had really bad anxiety in my late teens, early twenties. I wasn't even able to go to a movie theater, or a shopping mall. It was fine at the time I was a part time university student so I was able to take it easy for a few years and got better.



Last few years I have been living fairly normal but avoided things that would make me anxious. So no flying, and lived a fairly low key life. I was fine. I was cycling played squash. I never had as much drive and stamina as some other people but it wasn't that bad. I took the summer of it all because I injured my ankle.



So I haven't had much exercise since.



I have since a year ago slowly got to be more and more tired, though I always thought this was just down to me sleeping 6.5 h on average a night, and work was stressful too. Many times Id be exhausted and need a nap after work. 



So in my off time in the summer I gained a bit of weight, about 5kg. 3 months ago I went on a keto diet. Things started getting worse slowly on the diet and 2.5 weeks ago I decided to stop. I managed to lose 8KG so that part is good.



This is when my anxiety picked up big time. I was hungry every 2 hours, like insane hunger but at the same time nausea and having a hard time eating. This started up my anxiety and now I have chest pains and some fairly strong palpitations. A bulk of the chest pains I always had, I have badly healed ribs from a cycling accident so if I reach the wrong way or sit a certain way, it can hurt. Or if I lie on it when I sleep it will just hurt for a couple days. These Im ok with because I can reach for the pain and end up touching where bone is sticking out kinda. So I know what those are. 



I also started getting burps and gas. Sometimes Ill have a crazy pain near my heart, and then a bit later a burp will relieve it, but then its too late my anxiety has started. I have never felt such pain from gas before.



The hunger pangs and burping have gotten better but the palpitations now still send me into a spiral. I have to go back to work on tuesday but im worried i might not be able to. this is adding to the stress too now. I was thinking maybe I should go to the hospital and have my mind eased, it would sure be nice to hear that everything is fine, I really hope so. But I can't imagine how I would handle my anxiety if I went there. My friends just said go get it done but...



Today I tried to drive to an other city to go to a friends house but my heart palpitated 5 times and I turned around. I was nervous about the drive to begin with as its a bit far and I have had an anxiety attack on the way back the last time I was there. It was a brutal drive back. Meanwhile I spent last night and the night before hanging out at various friends homes and I was fine. So I dont think there is anything physically wrong with me. But I dont know.

"I had a panic attack about driving in the snow to my new job and had to call my boss crying to explain. I'm very embarrassed. I have terrible driving anxiety, especially in snow. I was in a really bad accident when I was 16 in a snow storm, and 6 years later I'm still struggling with terrible anxiety. If I have to drive in the snow or be with a driver I don't trust in the snow I will usually have a breakdown crying and hyperventilating, and will do anything to avoid driving in the snow. 

It's been fine the last few years because I walked to work. I've moved, started a new job three days ago and today was the first day I would have to drive in the snow. I was okay at first, but when I got out to my car to clean it off and start it I broke down. I sat in it and cried for 15 minutes trying to get myself going. At my shift start time I had to call my new boss and apologize and tell her I have terrible anxiety and I could not get myself to drive and I was trying. She called my coworker who was super nice and understanding and picked me up. But when I was on the phone with my boss she said ""oh no ... What are you going to do when it snows?""

"I got punched in the face and now I'm constantly anxious about it happening again. I've never been good at confrontation. If anything, I always try to avoid it. But sometimes there are things I find extremely unfair and I need to speak up.

About a week ago I was at a store where they had two rather huge macaws. One of them looked stressed as it had been pulling her feathers off and was almost featherless on her whole torso. The birds were not happy when people were close to the cages, which was usually followed by a lot of screeching and agitated flapping of their wings. As I was leaving the store, unable to handle the situation of those caged birds, I saw a woman harassing them for about 5 min by yelling and taping on the cages. I finally got the courage to walk up to her and ask her if she could leave the birds alone because they were already stressed. She was extremely rude, asking me if I knew who I was talking to. I didn't (she didn't look particular special, more like a very basic Kardashian knock off) so I said ""no, please stop harassing the birds and leave them alone""

She then proceeded to grab me by the hair (cat fight style) and punched me in the eye. Closed fist, I was wearing my prescription glasses which she destroyed. My family called the police. They arrived and upon telling them my story, they proceeded to tell me I could get arrested as well. I freaked out, she was laughing as she had managed to scratch her face to testify I had attacked her first. It was awful. 

In the end, I got a massive black eye, brand new prescription glasses destroyed, and a partially broken nose for trying to help. I didn't get justice at all and now I'm afraid of people. I haven't been able to go to crowded places or stores anymore. I can't look at people in the eye anymore. I'm just absolutely afraid that people will react irrationally for no reason and I end up getting assaulted again. I'm terrified. I really have no idea what to do with this irrational fear and I'd appreciate any advice.

I'm looking for advice or to help dealing with anxiety symptoms like nausea, diarrhea, headache etc. My brain always finds a way to invalidate me and stop me from overcoming my social anxiety by giving me new physical symptoms. 

I'm feeling especially sick these days undoubtedly because I broke up with my boyfriend, because I was too depressed and anxious and he couldn't handle it. It was a bad relationship and I'm happy it ended but still, I feel like a failure because I'm afraid my mental sickness will stop me from being loved by someone... AND I have exams in one week... so everything is changing in my life suddenly. For the best, I still hope !

Therefore, it's the perfect moment for me to start taking care of myself. I'm starting a therapy to understand better why I'm having this anxiety but maybe some of you have good recommendation to sooth these uncomfortable manifestations like physical exercise or hypnosis ? 

Thanks ! I'm waiting for your magical advices

"Looking for a Panic Attack Friend Sorry if this is weird. I've been having daily panic attacks (I guess that's what's wrong) and talking to people helps me.
I'd be happy to return the favor!! We can text. I don't use any IM's. Just kind of would like someone to talk to until it passes. Usually lasts about an hour for me but it's the first 30 minutes that really get to me.

"Anxie-tips. Or not really. Just a story of my anxiety and how im not taking shit from it anymore Eight years ago, i was diagnosed with chronic anxiety. That time, i shrugged it off thinking, ""hey, this is normal, right? Everyone gets anxious sometimes. This will go away, right?"" Wrong. Here i am, eight years later, cringing at past me for even thinking that anxiety goes away like a seasonal flu.

I spent some time going through therapy sessions, and while those helped, they didnt really cure me of my anxiety*, because for people like me, anxiety is ever-present -- an annoying, unwanted companion i am eternally cuffed with.

I struggled battling anxiety for a long time. It was hard to be a fully-functional human when every speedbump looked like a giant boulder in the middle of the road. Instead of looking for ways around it, my focus was on the speedbump-boulder and how impossible it was to conquer it. Anxiety paralyzed me and made me feel like i was always bound to fail.

The smallest tasks would sometimes trigger anxiety and panic. I would cross the road planning my funeral because what if the bus hits me? I would get invited to parties, and yes i craved to socialize, but i would bail because what if i spill the drink and make a mess of myself? Public speaking was the worst subject ever, because that triggered so much what-ifs. I was sweating with just the thought of mispronouncing words and forgetting my lines. There were days when i thought i was perfectly fine, then i would be attacked by constant panic and pressure that took away my ability to function, and i would shut myself in, because anxiety was crippling that way.

I quit a lot of things in my life -- school, jobs, relationships -- some, i didnt even get to start, all because i worried i wasnt good enough. I was scared of taking a course i wanted because what if i couldnt find a job after i graduated? I couldnt take these programs because what if i fail them and i had to retake them? I resigned from my teaching job because i feared no one would take my subjects the following year, that i might not be a good enough instructor. I was scared to build relationships and would stop talking to people i really liked or wanted to be friends with, because what if they dont understand me?

Because that was what i felt, that no one understood me. I craved validation and support, but instead, some of the people i cared about left me for being ""over-dramatic"" and a ""cry-baby,"" only because they didnt understand what i was going through. Well, same. How could i blame them when i myself couldnt understand it?

After years of battling anxiety, i got fed up with it and i internally told it to fuck off. It didnt. But i knew i had to do something about it, or else, i wouldnt be able to really live. I knew that there was only so much i could do to help myself. So i did. I read self-help books, which, if i would be honest, really didnt help that much because they all say the same things i already knew (still good reminders, though). I started reaching out to my fellow anxious people and asked for advice, because, you know, it takes one to know one, and they were the best people to talk to if i wanted to really get myself. Little by little, i gained confidence about who i was and what i was capable of. It took years and a lot of hard work, but i learned so much, and i couldnt be any more thankful to the people who helped me and made me feel a little better about myself.

Fast forward to a few years later. I cant say that i dont get anxious anymore. After all, anxiety is already a big chunk of who i am. Maybe i just learned a few tricks to manage it somehow. Or maybe it just doesnt scare me as much as it did before.

The fact is, there is no one-size-fits-all approach in managing anxiety. Some people fight their anxiety. Some people try to ignore it. If it works for you, then it must be for you. But if there's one thing i realized for myself, it's that fighting my anxiety is a losing battle, so i embrace it instead. I take a break. I breathe. I ground myself to my surroundings. This way, i know that i have control of the environment im in. I recognize the situation and try as much as possible to think logically. I acknowledge the facts, and while i cant really do anything about my emotions, i talk about the situation to the people who care to listen. If im alone, i express what upsets me through writing. I walk. I go for a run. Not to try to escape the situation, but to shake off the excess nerves. I look back to what makes me anxious and assess what i can do about it. If i need to take a break and feel the emotions as they happen, i allow myself a few hours, or maybe a few days to let it run its course. I think to myself, ""it will pass."" It always does.

To my fellow anxious people, you got this. It is a hard road, and you may sometimes feel alone, but youre not. Be kind to yourselves. If you need to cry, do it. If you need to rest, take as much break as you need. If it's too much to bear alone, seek help.

To everyone else, anxiety thrives in a person's inability to take control of a situation. When someone feels lost, it is important that they feel secured, heard, and validated. This is why it is important to show kindness and compassion to everyone.

"My story So I'm lying here in bed 8.20pm Ireland. 
Here's my story.

I've had a traumatic childhood. My Mother cheated on my dad numerous occasions. She developed OCD and left 5 kids with their daddy. Practically my childhood was hell, except the times I was with my dad. He's an angel! 

I'm the youngest in my family, now 21. I never spoke to anyone about what happened with my Mam, when people asked where she was I said on holidays! I put a brave face on. And I was good at doing it! 

I've done a lot of stupid shit in my life, got a DUI when I was driving home with my bro after being in Amsterdam.. That fucked me up a little bit as I had aspirations of being in the police etc.  So since then I've partied hard in college! 

I drank way more used drugs more commonly and I was loving it, this only lasted 4 weeks though! Woke up after doing MDMA and had a massive panic attack #Yikes. I thought I was dying and on the cold kitchen floor at 5am in the morning all I could think about was my dad and how I let him down, between everything. 

3 months on and I'm suffering really fucking badly from anxiety panic attacks etc. the panic attacks have kinda ceased, but I'm in a constant fear and stressed out about the anxiety - and its symptoms. This is all so new to me! 

Anxiety symptoms (Weird vision/headaches/inability to swallow/heart palpitations/dis realization) 

I've started seeing a guy in Dublin, he's an holistic therapist. He's helped so much compared to all the other avenues I've tried in my bid to feel ok again. He believes it's all this trauma I've experienced coming out now and I don't have any mental disorder etc. rather an emotional one! To my relief.

I'm very sporty and outgoing usually but I have now deferred college and stopped working. Literally isolated myself so much to this day, I just can't seem to get back out there. CONSTANT FEAR is really starting to make me suicidal. That's why I'm writing this tonight is the worst night I've experienced, I have been planning my death the past week. Getting money in order for my dad and writing letters. This needs to stop, I know I have the power to change this but I don't have the courage or strength. 

I just cry. I'm so alone. I'm so afraid. I'm so lost 
I just want to be loved. I wish I had a mother who I could love now more than ever. I want my life back.

"Don't know how I'm going to make it I have suffered from anxiety more or less since I was a teenager. At times my anxiety (i.e. social anxiety) has been more tolerable and I have been somehow able to get through all kinds of anxiety giving and to me terrifying life events.  This haven't been easy and because of this I have not progressed in my studies at the same speed as others. 

About two years ago I had major changes in my life that somehow burst my anxiety in flames. 
I was diagnosed with GAD, social phobia and depression. My studies at the university have been mostly at recess since then. And I feel like shit. 

I have only my master's thesis to do so that I graduate and I have tried to do it as much as I can. Although I feel like my IQ has lowered since I have nowadays trouble concentrating, remembering things and most of my time goes to being anxious. I'm also terrified that I have to give three oral presentations within 6 months if I want to graduate. Feels like I'm between rock and a hard place. I have also bunch of anxiety about million other things. Don't know how I'm going to survive through my studies... and life. 

I'm not sure why I wrote this here. Maybe I'm longing to hear about similar experiences, dunno. And sorry for grammatical errors etc. English isn't my native language.

"Any advice for communicating relationship anxiety to boyfriend? About six months in to first real adult LTR and I'm pretty confident he's the one and this is it. We are very similar people but of course have our differences and something I don't think he naturally understands is my anxiety. I feel secure in the relationship except some days all it takes is one little comment or look (such as widening eyes at something I say or joking about not seeing me the next day - pretty much anything that isn't perfectly Prince Charming) and I spiral. For at least 48-72 hours it's an exhausting, nauseating, and obsessive he doesn't like me he wants to leave me he decided I'm not right omg I'll never be loved the way I need to be this is it the relationship is dying... etc. (Lack of punctuation in there was fully for dramatic effect, haha). I'm googling, reading blogs, pacing and talking myself through it, and working to calm the thoughts until he happens to say something extra cute and I feel better. 

I've shared a bit of this with him but only after the fact. I'm scared that he'll interpret my need for reassurance as a criticism that he isn't doing enough, and I'm well aware the problem lies with me more than him. So I cope with it alone but I hate that. Has anyone else struck a good balance between self help and leaning on a partner? Any tips when I'm in this spiral?

"Work related... I don't know what! Just after some advice. I'm in constant fear of losing my job. No one else I work for has this mentality and if anyone does they don't show it. 
I had a career in the raf, I'm an aircraft engineer by trade and never had a care in the world as I always knew my job was safe. When I had children I left and joined one of the biggest companies in the UK. Virtually from day 1 the company has been room and gloom and all the old timers have said this is how it is here. But since the brexit vote and what is happening now I seem to be at a level where I'm constant agitated. I'm always down, I don't want to go out I honestly feel like bursting into tears with how I feel. 
It's gotten to the point where even work colleagues take the Mick and gang up on everything to what I'm wearing to how I do things. I've always been cautious and have a rainy day fund of close to 10k for emergencies. One work member found out about this spread it now I can't even vent at work as someone will always twist it and I get even more shit back. I try talking to my wife about it. But I don't really get anywhere as my shifts and holiday are always changing. I know it is down the the company I work for but leaving at this economical time I feel would be worse... or would it. I want to progress in my career and have started a degree which I'm on my 2nd module but it's again loaded up my time and it's another thing to worry about. I've never been to see medical help about this and I think I still hold a stigma about using the A word and D word as it's still not fully understood and in my line of work can be used against you. I suppose I'm just using this platform to vent to as work side no one understands that it's all beginning to be too much. I'm a double Afghanistan veteran that never saw the dirty side of war but people expect or think that I am. My family are brilliant but as the main bread winner I can't and don't want to pass my worries to them.

"Please tell me to stop panicking. Right now I'm worrying myself sick over something ridiculous and I just need someone to reassert how ridiculous it is so that I may stop worrying.

I've been dating a guy for about a month now - we'll call him J. J and I speak online every day and have met up a couple of times and it's always been lovely. J always takes the time to send me a quick message to let me know when he's on his break at work, always says good morning, etc.
I'd noticed that over time we've been speaking less and less. We still speak every day, and across several hours, but the messages are few and far between. We use snapchat so that isn't necessarily too bad, and because we use snapmaps I'm able to see his last activity (I'm not a stalker, I just get major anxiety about being ignored). He'll go hours without opening the app and obviously that's fine, but my anxiety tells me he doesn't wanna speak to me as much as he used to. We're not in a relationship but he'd told me he wished to be exclusive until he was ready to be my 'proper boyfriend', and because of this I've tried to justify the infrequent contact as simply being the end of the 'honeymoon phase' - we're still into each other, but we don't need to be OTT with the messaging anymore. 
So I saw J a few nights ago, and after a few drinks I told him I'd been worried that he didn't like me anymore. When I gave him my reasons he laughed and said I was being silly and that of course he liked me and wanted to keep seeing me. In that moment I was so relieved, but now I find myself feeling paranoid about the whole situation all over again. I know it's probably because I was ghosted quite a lot in 2018 and it's left me with many insecurities, and I always assume anyone who comes into my life is going to leave without warning. The worst thing is that I've been told by basically everyone that I have no reason to worry - especially seeing as J himself has reassured me! I just really need a hug right now.",Anxiety
"How do I help my girlfriend deal with my anxiety and depression? So as the title says I'm wondering if anyone has any tips for how to help my girlfriend feel better and to deal with my depression.  
We have a very communicative and open relationship so on that part we're good. But my anxiety is the kind that is constant and also deeply connected with my apartment. Whenever I step in something just switches on and I feel bad. This makes it so that during long breaks from my occupation I get depressed because my body eventually just shuts down from the emotional stress.  
My girlfriend has never been with anyone with these issues and finds it difficult to not take it personally. With thoughts such as ""Why is he feeling anxiety around me? He makes all my troubles go away."". 
And so on it goes as she has her own bout of anxiety, though not to the point of being depressed.  
This last week has been mental hell for me. I had a depression attack that resulted in complete emotional shutdown. It made it hard to express love for my girlfriend even though deep down I knew it was there.  
I've put myself on a waiting list for a therapist but until then I need to know what others have done to help their partners cope. I always know that I can come out the other side of my depression but now I have someone else to care for as well and I can't just let her fall by the wayside as I go in to complete shutdown.",Anxiety

I know I have no hope for a permanent position in this organisation which means I will eventually have to change job or accept to live with the insecurity and lack of recognition of my work.



 I decided a couple of months ago to try and pursue an other job opportunity at an other education level (I'm in the education system) But now, I've applied a couple of times already on different opening not too far from where I live. I got no call back, not even an interview. 



The last one that I applied for is a 3 days a week about 3.5 hours away from my home, in an area that I fell in love with. It would honestly be the best case scenario for me to get this job. I can come back here 4 days a week, work a little, prep things for my husband and children for the week and spend 3 days in my perfect (and yet I can't just move my family there) environment, trying out a new job that I feel I would be perfect at, without having to drop everything. 



The application ends on Thursday, supposedly for the job to start on Monday. I applied through human resources and was adviced to e-mail the head of the department as well to reinforce the seriousness of my application. I'm trying to write that email right now and it is the most difficult thing I ever had to write. I want this job sooooo bad! I feel like it would just be the perfect solution to so many of my anxiety related problems! And I want that person to see that maybe I'm not the perfect fully trained and experienced employee, but I'm certainly the most enthusiastic and I can bring something to the table.

I don't post very often so please bear with me.

I have suffered from stress, anxiety and paranoia sporadically over the past few years. The stress and anxiety are manageable now thankfully. But the paranoia just seems to get worse. I have a boyfriend of a year who is totally trustworthy and has never done anything to make me think bad of him. But whenever he goes out I just can't help going in to full on panic mode that something will happen. I dread him going out and when he does go out, I just feel over the top anxious the whole night and even for the next day. I try to talk myself down like I've learnt in the past but even that doesn't help. I want him to be able to go out on his own with his friends and not to think that I hate it. I want to feel relaxed when he's out and not constantly worry. The worry often turns to anger at him even though he has done nothing wrong.

"Sometimes my boyfriend seemingly puts me in anxious situations. Today on the phone my boyfriend and I were arguing and I said I didn't want to fight anymore, and can we talk about something else. Out of nowhere he says, fine but I have things I want to argue about but not now. First off, he never ever argues with me. He's never really expressed any issues in our relationship, it's me who does and tries to resolve them. He tends to sweep things under the rug. For him to say that and then not tell me what it is that he wants to argue about completely set of my anxiety. 

You know that whole body tingling feeling when it starts coming. Yup. And then I started crying. And he asked what was wrong. And I said you know what's wrong. I asked him if everything was fine and if he was mad at me. And he said it was and he wasn't. But how can I believe him? Maybe he just doesn't want to get into it now. 

I'm spiraling thinking about what he could want to argue about. What I did wrong, etc. he know how anxious I get and I feel like saying something like that he knew would be triggering. And he wasn't particularly reassuring either.

"Zoloft - restless &amp; uneasy Hello fellow anxious human beings! 
I really hope you want to help a socially anxious soul on this lonely planet. 

So, to put things in context I'm beginning with some background info about my situation. I'm 19 years old and have been dealing with disabling social anxiety for years. Lately when I finished high school and started a new job, it reached a peak. So, I managed to reach out to a doctor whom got Sertraline (Zoloft) prescribed for me. 

I took my first pill of 50 mg (apparently a pretty low dosage) yesterday and just a couple of hours later the side effects started showing up, one after the other. 

Initially, I started feeling really anxious for no reason (social anxiety does make me anxious in social situations, but usually doesn't occur in my own home where I feel safe). Next thing I feel restless like hell (legs on fire). Even after working out for 30 minutes it comes back within an hour. 

So finally to the part where I would really appreciate some input. Are these side effects passing soon? When can I expect to feel better from the Zoloft? I mean, tomorrow I'm off to work. Am I giving in to my anxiety if I call in sick? 'Cause, sitting still at an office for 8 hours straight feels like an impossibility right now. Anyone with the same/similar experience that has any input on my issue? 

And thanks in advance for helping out!

"Avoidance I wish I knew how to work around this. I feel like I'm better/less anxious than I used to be partially because I've learned to deal with some of my small triggers (ex: texting a friend I've been out of touch with out of the blue without worrying that they're going to think I'm weird or annoying) but when it comes to bigger triggers (money, driving, moving out) the reason they don't make me anxious is because I just avoid thinking about them entirely. It's gotten to the point where I'm starting to avoid seeing my boyfriend because I'm afraid he's going to bring up wanting to move in together which will make me anxious. So logically, if I don't see him, we don't have to talk about it, I don't have to think about it, and I won't be anxious.

"Taking advantage of the worst few days of my life. The last few months have been pretty hard as I've been tapering off the antidepressants I've been on for years in order to switch to a new one. 

While the meds were good for my anxiety, they allowed me to develop some extremely negative behaviors like becoming isolated, eating poorly, never exercising, never going outside and getting sunlight or socializing, awful sleep habits, etc. 

Long story short, the new AD gave me the worst few panic attacks I've gotten in my life that culminated in an emergency visit to urgent care for Xanax after having not slept for days. I'm going to stop the meds for a while - I've become dependent on them and ignored all the obvious bad habits the antidepressants were masking over the years.

I'm feeling better this morning after finally getting a full nights sleep. 

I exercised -  out of desperation - for the first time in months. 

I've already lowered my drinking quite a bit from in the last two months from near alcoholism / weekly binge drinking of the last few years, but I'm dropping the booze 100% from now on.

"Extreme Anxiety / Paranoia Hey, posting this on a throwaway because I don't want friends to find this.  
While with friends or at school I'm not so anxious, but when I get home, I get in my bed and start having episodes of severe anxiety.  
I started thinking a while ago about how there's not a chance people are treating me nicely just because, and that someone is telling people to be nice to me.  
I know, this sounds ridiculous. And I think so too, but I can't seem to shake off that feeling. I feel that way for a couple of reasons, and no matter how I think about how dumb that is, I go through my daily life thinking that must be why people are nice to me, and not just because their nice to me.  
For example, one time in class, I was talking to this girl and she complimented my muscles (and it's not like I have really big or ""good"" by any measure. I have been training and there was an improvement, but this was after a couple of weeks I didn't train). Now, I thought to myself, huh, that's nice. Now, I got home, sat at my computer chatting with friends, while my brother comes by, randomly feels my muscles and compliments them. I immediately began thinking to myself ""What are the odds two people have complimented my muscles on the same day after no one has EVER complimented them? Also after a couple of weeks I didn't train.""  
I know this is absurd, but no matter how much I try to shake off that feeling, it still lingers, and I doubt I will ever shake that feeling off. ",Anxiety

I'm so nervous about going to this jazz rehearsal that I'm sitting in my bed crying and trying to think of a way out. My parents are forcing me to face things that it physically pains me to face and I don't know what to tell them to make them understand.

"First time post Hi, I'm a 36 year old female, been dealing with anxiety for most of my life, but had my first true panic attack at 18. It's been on and off since then, including bouts of PPD/PPA with two of my three kids. I've been on and off Zoloft (which does help...when I take it) and in and out of therapy. Four years ago I had a week-long inpatient psychiatric stay (voluntary) following a miscarriage.

Now I've been having another resurgence over the last month. It's been ramping up for a while, but Christmas always stresses me out. I've been off my meds for several months. So a month ago I try to go out and as soon as I'm out of my neighborhood I get a huge rush of anxiety. I go back to the house an get my husband so he can drive. We almost get to the store when I just completely lose it. I'm screaming, crying, writhing around in my seat, talking about how I'm about to die (all in front of my two young kids and scaring the crap out of them). I make my husband pull over and I call an ambulance. End up in the ER for a few hours and got sent home with a Vistaril prescription (an antihistamine that also reduces anxiety apparently)

I went right back on the Zoloft that day, starting with 50mg. Saw my primary care doctor about 1.5 weeks ago and he approved me to go up to 100mg. I've been seeing some improvement but still have ups and downs. 

New Years Day I had a bad stabbing chest/back pain combined with ear/throat pain. Googling my symptoms led me to believe I was having a heart attack so I begged my husband to bring me to urgent care. I had the whole workup (EKG, troponin tests, continuous monitoring, etc. ) and everything came back fine. The ear and throat pain ended up being fluid draining from my ear. 

Thursday and Friday were much better days. I went shopping (my husband suggested we go to Target before grocery shopping, which helped make me feel more calm, I love Target lol). Friday I made sure I was eating and drinking and felt great. Yesterday however was a bad day. We went out to Walmart and I didn't eat before we went, so that made me feel anxious and I was cramping all over my torso (stomach, rib cage, back), feeling light headed, etc. Husband made me eat a muffin and drink some water which made me feel better for a while. But I dealt with waves of anxiety for the rest of the day and near constant chest/back pain and the nagging feeling in the back of my head that I'm dying. 

It's causing a considerable strain on my marriage. My husband is trained as a first responder (he was a safety coordinator at a previous job) and he's dealt first-hand with heart attacks and the like (we actually had a man have a heart attack in our front yard one day and my husband administered first aid to him until the ambulance arrived. Sadly, he didn't make it). He constantly tries to reassure me that I'm not having a heart attack, that it's just the anxiety like all the times before. But he feels like I don't trust him because my anxiety just won't let the intrusive thoughts go. He actually thinks that I should have had another inpatient stay when I went to the ER last month, even if it meant I might have missed Christmas. It's stressing him out and he feels like he can't help me.

To top it all off, I had my first period in 2.5 years (I'm on nexplanon birth control, implant in the arm) and I've actually been bleeding lightly for the last month (I'm calling my OB/GYN tomorrow about that). Which has seriously put a damper on intimacy. Which make me feel like an even worse wife. 

I just, most days I feel like I'm clawing my way back, that I can see the light at the end of the tunnel. Then I have days like yesterday where I'm dealing with a constant low-to-mid level of anxiety and nagging feelings in my head and I feel like a huge burden to my family. I just can't get rid of the feeling that there is actually something wrong with me (other than the anxiety of course). ",Anxiety
"Scared of every little muscle twitch and little pains. Hello guys, Ive been kind of anxious my whole life, but last year my first serious panic attack happened (had only few nocturnal ones which I didnt know were panic attacks) and it took a bad turn afterwards. I started therapy which together with passed time helped and theyve been kept to minimum, but some irrational thought of heart attack still remains. It feels like Im hyper aware of every little thing that happens to my body physically - especially any little pain around my sternum, muscle twitches around my chest or this weird tingle around my head. And dont get me started on feeling like my heart is pumping with the force of some kind of super pump. Often Im scared I will faint. I have never had higher blood pressure, visited doctors etc.

"First time writing. Please help 34 year old male here

My wife and I have been going through a divorce for about 2 months. I started off with terrible anxiety, flustered, can't think straight, etc. 

I meet a girl who works for a doctor friend of mine. We start texting and see ing each other and all the anxiety and bubble guts goes away. I was really into her, she's telling the mutual friend she's into me and things are going great. I vibed with this woman more than I have with any other girl I've met. Had more in common with her than any woman I'd ever been with. 

She told me she had anxiety problems. Out of nowhere 2 days ago she tells me we shouldn't talk, and she's scared to hurt me. The whole time she was with me her anxiety had been under wraps and she was feeling better but the switch flipped and she's scared she's going to hurt me and she was so into me and cared about me so much that she couldn't hurt me. 

It crushed me. I couldn't understand it. Because I felt like were helping each other. Then I found out last night that she was seeing one of my closest friends who's married with 3 kids and another due in a month all the way up until the week her and I began talking. He never told me but tried to coax her into staying talking to him. 

The thought that those two were intimate is eating me alive. My anxiety has come back with a vengeance. I can't sleep, eat, use the bathroom, etc. I feel disgusted knowing what they had done and that she went from him to me and lied to my face because I had questioned her about their relationship weeks prior.

"My anxiety to live [perhaps triggering] I've never labeled the feelings I feel as anxiety. As for many other inner chaos I deal with I am hesitant to give them the name they perhaps hold because I've never been diagnosed with any of it.
My hands are tied in that regard. I can't allow myself to seek professional help, even though I probably really need it and many I have trusted with my issues have desperately recommend me to do so.

Perhaps it is a mixture of not being able to do so and denial. Because everything is fine, isn't it? I don't have problems, others have it way worse.

I wake up terrified. Wishing I'd not wake up. Wishing I could just go back to sleep forever and that time would just stop running away from me. But it doesn't. It ticks forward to the eventual challenges I have to phase that make my heart race and breath quicken when I think about it.

My whole day I spent in low hanging dread. I feel like I can't enjoy my life anymore. Even when I'm with friends, having a good time or when I'm with my SO who I love very much. I feel happy, but eventually the nagging thoughts of the the tasks that I fear comes back. I can't stop thinking about it. The whole day I spent in bed, doing essentially nothing while I think I'm only wasting time.

I fear failure and social rejection so much it tightens my throat in extreme cases. Sometimes I'm even afraid of driving because I irrationally fear of failing in that. The thought of it causes intense inner panic. 

I'm miserable.
I'm exhausted.

"Had the worst panic attack I've ever had. My symptoms seemed extreme. Has anyone else ever panicked like this? Need some tips on stopping hyperventilating. I'm terrible at keeping things brief, especially when I'm anxious like I am now. What lies ahead is a giant wall of text describing the worst panic attack I've ever had.

I'm 25, m, had panic attacks for last 10 years on and off.

Taken zoloft everyday for over a year. It helps alot.

Maybe 1 panic attack a month for the last year (pretty good) and none of them have been much more than fear, trembling, and heavy breathing.

Two nights ago, for no reason, I had the worst one ever.

9pm, watching youtube at my computer, I'm relaxed. No thoughts really. Suddenly; impending doom feeling. Got some chest heaviness, a little twitchy. Soon, breathing becomes fast. Start hyperventalating.

20 minutes go by. Decide to go lay in bed and try to calm down. In bed, lips begin to tingle, then my face, then my scalp, then my neck. This is where my typical attacks climax.

This time was different. It didn't stop. 1hr into panic, my tingling lips were now locked and cramped in a whistling position. Lips are trembling, like a vibration. Next, my cheeks tingled and then those began to twitch and cramp erratically. The twitches were so bad I could see in them in a mirror.

Now, eye lids twitching. Gets so bad I lost control of my left eyelid. I couldn't open it. Suddenly, my entire face is numb but twitching, almost every muscle.

Then tingling spreads to body. Most notably in my hands and feet. Suddenly couldnt move my fingers. I would attempt to move my pointer, and my ring would move. Then they completely locked up and my toes began to curl and hurt terribly.

Now we're in full freak out, tears and all, I'm convinced I'm having a stroke. I scream for my wife to come in the room, I attempt to say ""Please help me, this is the worst panic attack ive ever had."" but my lips were so cramped and immovable what I said sounded like slurred nonsense. I tried to talk more, and the more i tried the more I couldn't control my tongue and lip muscles to pronounce anything correctly. My wife could also see my hands visibly curled. I was so scared at this point I was yelling at my wife the best I could ""I'm dying, Im fucking dying, this is it.""

My wife is fairly familiar with dealing with me in this kind of state, but I was acting so weird this time she decided to take me to the ER. I got up and could barely manage to put my pants and shoes on without falling over.

The room was getting darker and brighter over and over, I guess I was on verge of fainting, but I made it to the er. This ER is familiar with me and has done all sorts of tests on me before when I came in a similar but less serious condition. My heart rate was nearing 200 and my blood pressure was through the roof. I was sitting on the hospital bed with my legs crossed holding my jacket over my face, holding back tears, and shaking (because I'm embarassed as hell, even in front of these dr's and nurses).

The DR on duty comes in, tells me he's 99% sure I'm just having a panic attack, and gives me two iv injections of ativan and an injection of benadryl.

Whithin minutes, I began to feel wonderful, of course, and every symptom slowly faded away, and they discharged me 45 minutes after coming in the door and I went home and slept like a drugged up baby.

All night tonight/morning its been trying to come on again, for the past hour my lips have started to tingle and I'm feeling very anxious. Like I did the other night before it got really bad. So I took 2x .25 xanax and 2 benadryl. An hour has passed since then. I'm still hyperventilating and the tingles and numbness are coming on stronger and stronger still.

Have any other fellow panic sufferers had an episode this bad? The whole, not being able to speak thing, really freaked me the hell out and now I'm terrified of it happening again. My dr told me most of those symptoms are probably due to hyperventilating and he told me if I want to avoid this I need to not hyperventilate. But how?? I don't even notice im doing it.

Does anybody with experience with this know any good tips or techniques that have personally helped you curb hyperventilation? Assuming thats my worst enemy.

Also constantly interrupts when my mum wants to talk.  I actually noting it on a piece of paper today and it was, no joke, 67 times she tried to say something and he interrupted 52 of those times.

Tonight I could take his Muslim bashing anymore.  When he said it was a fact that 20% of all Muslims are terrorists I asked him for his source.  When he stated it was ""security firms"" I asked him which.  When he couldn't tell me but told me I had to respect his opinion I told him I want to read what he had formed this opinion on.  He got quite upset and started raving about antifa and how I had to listen to Ben Shapiro and Jorden Petersen. 

I sat through all this and calmly insisted that I would not respect his opinion unless he could back up that opinion with information on how he had come to it.  All the while trying to keep my face calm while my entire body was shaking.  I made sure the camera only showed my face.

I feel happy about calling him out but I am so so tired and so drained.  I feel so frustrated and disappointed with him.  

It was late here when the call finished so I had noone I could talk to.  Ive had a cry which helped a bit and now I'm trying to fall asleep but its not happening so I'm typing on reddit.

"Anxiety about my weighted blanket? Hi,

I have depression and anxiety as well as Crohn's, related arthritis, and Degenerative Disc Disease in my lumbar region. My fianc?? got me a weighted blanket for Christmas and I was thrilled. I often sleep with a lot of blankets on because I love the weight, but I get really hot and thats not really conducive to a good night's rest. 

So it's been less than two weeks since Christmas and my anxiety has convinced me that the weighted blanket is essentially worsening all my symptoms. There are legitimate reasons that my symptoms could be worsening, but I've gotten myself so worked up about this idea that by sleeping with my weighted blanket (15 additional pounds) I am creating stress on my body, and therefore responsible for the aches and painsomnia I've been experiencing. 

This is nuts right? I know this whole rumination issue just perpetuates the anxiety and actually stresses my body, which actively worsens the Crohn's.

"My Anxiety *Someone give me a good method to help me deal with it* Hey guys,

I decided to post something on here because honestly I have no one else I would really like to talk about it with.

Ever since a kid I think I've had terrible anxiety even though I have not spoken to a professional about it I can almost 80% confirm I do. My first time that I can remember experiencing anxiety was around the age of 12 years old. Me and some friends cut through an ally way on the way to school and some man said he would call the police. Ever since that for the next 2 weeks or so I would stay up all night not being able to fall asleep because my mind would be racing thinking The police are going to come to my house soon Etc. One night I even heard a police syrin nearby and literally looked out my window expecting the police to come to my house. In my mind I knew it was way over the top but I felt no control over it.

At first I thought maybe it was insomnia for sleep. But shortly after that I was sleeping fine and it was all good. Later on in my teenage years (I'm a teenager but almost an adult) I've experienced lots of anxiety and it continues on to this day. I'm currently writing this because I can't sleep. My childhood has been some what ?rough' around 13-14 I started to get into drugs and doing other bad things, at the age of 15 I was at court.

I know I can't go to the doctor every time I freak out, and I need to learn to deal with this myself. Ugh. 

Happy Sunday and here's to managing anxiety, it's an uphill struggle!",Anxiety
"Will it ever get better I turned 40 last year and I didn't imagine my life to be like this,staying in all the time being reclusive,my social anxiety has definitely got worse the older I've become,can't keep a job cos I hate being around people that much.Ive tried meds also cbt but nothing has worked.Just really fed up of this shit....sorry just venting and just want to get it out..always trying to keep the faith but sometimes it's so damn hard (that's what she said) ????",Anxiety
"I was anxious about getting to sleep, and now I have to work in 3 hours with no sleep and I want to call in, but I'm anxious about that too. My anxiety normally keeps me up in bed for a bit but not to this point. I've been on my phone because I know if I shut my eyes I'll just get even more anxious. 

I don't have a very long shift but I don't want to drive in this state, and I especially don't want to work in this state. I'm mainly anxious about calling work because they're already usually short staffed, especially on Sundays, but I don't feel like it should be my burden to make sure the place is staffed up. I'm pretty sure they just lost an employee a few days ago, too. Plus, my family is doing Christmas late due to weird schedules, so we're opening gifts after my shift and I sure as hell don't want to be exhausted through that. 

I know it needs to be done. I know I have to call in. I'm not well. But I just don't know what to say to manager. I've never called in a single day at this place and I'm so afraid they're going to be pissed. I hate how managers seem to guilt people for things like this. I hate it so much. Sorry for the rant, I'm just exhausted and I just want to sleep for a week.",Anxiety

"How to deal with heartache and anxiety I have been with my date (same age as me) for more than 2 years. We are doing great for the first two years, survivng college together, helping each other out. Recently, she confessed that her heart is wavering and she doesn't want to commit to the relationship yet.  
  
She said that she had a crush on someone, and it's more like serious admiration. She advised me to date other girls as a form of consideration and kindness, rather than me waiting for her like a dog on a leash waiting with uncertainty. She said if she'll commit now, it would look like cheating if she liked someone else while having a relationship with me.
  
I felt blasted and very sad because while I want her to know herself and explore the world more, there's this heartache that haunts me because I am anxious whether she'll come back or not.
  
I really don't know what to do right now. I am working and I feel demotivated of everything. Should I wait for her? Or should I follow her advice instead?",Anxiety
"Too anxious to sleep I'm just dreading going back to uni tomorrow?or today I guess since it's 5am. 

Feeling horrible for many reasons all year, and the biggest impact is sleep.

My heart keeps beating too fast, I can't sit still, and dwelling on anything makes me cry.

Spent most of the night working in an attempt to keep my head occupied, but now I'm just lying in bed trying and failing to sleep.",Anxiety
"Has anyone experienced this kind of need to articulate? I had the worst anxiety spike I've had in a very long time about 2 days ago. It lasted 9-10 hours at work and then slowly came down when I was on my way home.

I realize how completely altered I was. I still can't really even remember or understand how my brain was perceiving the social cues I got. I thought that I had somehow did something wrong with zero evidence to back it up. It also led me to believe that I had lost 2 of my very close friends who are Co workers and a person I'm trying to become friends with that is also a coworker. 

Anyways. I would sit at my desk doing my work. But I felt this need in my brain. Like the ultimate itch. I do have very good willpower and pain tolerance, but I couldn't say no to scratching this itch. (it wasn't a physical itch that I scratch). It manifested with me needing to twirl pencils between my fingers. When I normally do it, it is casual, but this I needed to use as much force and create as many revolutions as possible. Also I would move my fingers very quickly, almost rhythmic but also with a some sort of influence of a muscle spasm it felt like. 

I want to know if this is a documented condition and any help is greatly appreciated.",Anxiety
I can't resist OCD and it hurts so much! The exposure. It's so fucking hard. Most of the time I give in. It's so painful! It feels like if I do one more ritual it'll never come back ever again. Help!,Anxiety
"So I just absolutely lost it over a tree.... I swear, next year we're getting a fake tree. I just completely lost control over stripping our tree down of all its decorations. It was SO beautiful, and now... it's so empty. I feel so bad for it now. Is this guilt? Grief? 

What the hell is happening?!

I actually feel like the tree is scared. Like, how I would be in the same situation. How insanely irrational, but my god!! I'm about in throes of a panic attack over it. I feel horrible!!!!",Anxiety
"Working at a job for awhile but still making mistakes I've been working at my job for the last three years. In the beginning I was making mistakes as I was still new to the job. After the initial hump, I've improved as the years gone by and rarely made any mistakes. However as of recently I've been making a ton of mistakes (e.g. cash discrepancies). I do not know what caused this recent string of mistakes as I am usually really careful when counting my cash. Due to this issue, I've been extremely anxious during work causing me to make even more mistakes. After every shift I've been over analyzing each and every move/transaction that I've done. I am worried about going into my next shift and getting reprimanded or getting retrained over this. I feel disappointed in myself since I have seniority/more experience yet am still making dumb mistakes. I'm getting even more anxious about not being able to fix this issue.",Anxiety
"Recurring anxiety that everyone I interact with can't stand me I'm 26 and have pretty constant anxiety about anything and everything, this includes social anxiety that results in paranoia. When I'm interacting with new people (particularly people I'm attracted to, authority figures or people I perceive to be threatening in some manner) I get anxious and immediately retreat into my own head. Conversation rarely feels easy and natural, I often end up stumbling over words leaving awkward silences OR on other occasions, I'll end up word vomiting, cutting people off and usually put my foot in my mouth. I sense that most people don't really want to engage after this, which is understandable. In these interactions I get so anxious it feels like it's out of my control.

I find this incredibly frustrating but what concerns me more is the recurring feeling that friends and loved ones are getting fed up with me. 

I've experienced paranoia about whether coworkers, classmates, friends actually enjoy my company or if they are just tolerating my presence. While it's somewhat easier to engage with them than strangers, I'm usually still anxious when interacting &amp; I'm sure it shows. I fixate on awkward interactions &amp; if I offend anyone, I feel like I've tarnished their perception of me and that makes me even more uncomfortable talking to them.  

These insecurities have made their way into almost every romantic relationship I've had. Paranoia and doubts start creeping in that I'm ruining things, and often it's a self fulfilling prophecy. I'd imagine it gets tiring having to constantly convince someone you love them. 

It's difficult to know what's real and whether or not to trust my own perceptions :(

Wondering if anyone else experiences this? What has helped you to cope?
