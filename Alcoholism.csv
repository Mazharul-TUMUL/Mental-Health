Description,Mental State
"I have struggled most of my life with alcohol, but am thankfully now sober. One of things that was an impediment to me recognizing my addiction was how normalized drinking is in our society. When I would tell my friends I thought I had a problem with drinking, they would become defensive and try to downplay any problems I was telling them about. Looking back, I think they knew that if I admitted that I had a problem, maybe that meant they then had a problem too.
What I have come to realize being on the other side of alcohol addiction is it really is a spectrum. Your addiction to alcohol doesn't have to be the absolute worst case scenario for it still to be an addiction. Maybe you are a functional alcoholic who can still have relationships and hold down a job, but how much of your own potential are you leaving on the table by drinking? How much time are you wasting by being hungover for half or all of the day and being drunk 3-5 nights out of the week? Shouldn't that be a compelling enough reason to quit?
Alcohol use doesn't have to be abnormal to be a problem. The problem is, we live in a sick society that normalizes unhealthy dependencies on basically anything that can be monetized, alcohol included.
So, good luck out there to anyone who knows they have a problem with alcohol and wants to quit, or simply wants more out of their lives and knows alcohol is holding them back. In either case, don't let the sick lens of society cloud your ability to judge what you actually need to do to heal yourself and realize your full potential.",Alcoholism
"Back when I was heavy into my drinking I tried many times to stop. Developed very very bad migraines right as I finally made the decision that it was time to stop stop and changed my living enviroment, freinds, habits ectect. I feel bad because many people I know look to me as a role model and think my alcoholism is gone. They dont know that I think about it every single day and the only reason I have not started back up is my migraines and neurological issues. I dream of a day when they are gone so I can then drink again. I miss the feeling of being gone. The feeling of passing out. The disconnect. Alas here I am onto the next one. ",Alcoholism
"Went through a rough start to get here but feeling so much better. So far went through Super bowl, Valentine?s and a move this weekend. Thanks for all the support! Plan on keeping it going!",Alcoholism
"Concerned for a loved one. Drinks every other day until they?re drunk. Can never just have a beer or two, always needs to be the whole pack.",Alcoholism
"I?ve struggled with drinking my entire adult life now (24m) and it?s really effected not only my health but just how I interact with other people. I always tell myself that I?m going to quit but can?t seem to find any of willpower to do so. Accountability would really benefit me. I was sober almost an entire month when I told my roommate I was doing sober October. I don?t want to give too many details, but for personal reasons, I?m not ready to go to meetings (I will someday, but I?m just not ready yet.) and I don?t want to rely on my roommate again because I know he won?t understand. Is there any groups online or maybe apps that will link me up with a sponsor?I just need somebody to ask me if I?m doing the work. Sorry if this isn?t for this sub I?m just sort of desperate.",Alcoholism
"30 Y/O Male here. Been drinking roughly 8 shots thru-out the day for the last month or so. Definitely starting to feel the side effects, bloated stomach, hammering anxiety, no real liver or abdominal pain but I can tell ya, this isn?t fun. I have Librium and Ativan (no I don?t mix them) so yeah been here before, this time just feels more exhausting. I?m able to keep food down no problem. Bowel movements seem fine. Just sick and tired of being in this anxiety ridden foggy hell hole!! If anyone else is trying to get to their first 24 hours.",Alcoholism
"Im the usual suspect. Early 30s, been drinking since a teen. Battling depression and obesity. Best friends with mary jane since I was 16. I seem to go through these periods where I drink my dace off for a few weeks then I take a few weeks off. Except the on weeks are becoming more frequent. How do you resist the urge? I know I need to quit both substances but lack zero will power to do so it seems. Feel like shit because of it",Alcoholism
"here is what i did today. i cleaned up trash, put away clean laundry, dirty laundry in the basket, organized a little, made the bed. but left drug/alcohol stuff in place. didnt even look in the fridge to see if there was anything in there. i like to write him letters a lot, and little notes. i got him a little book a year ago i write little notes in. i wrote to him that i initially considered throwing away and taking any remaining alcohol but then realized how important it would be for him to make the decision about what to do with it. and reminded him he could absolutely ask me for help if he needs help.",Alcoholism
"I know my SO has a drinking problem. I wouldn?t call him an alcoholic because I don?t think he has a physical need for it, yet. Which scares me because I feel like at the rate he is drinking currently he could eventually get there. We?ve been together since we were 16 years old. We?re now 22 with two kids. My SO was raised around alcohol is whole life. His grandma, who which he?s very close with, is a diagnosed alcoholic and has been for many years. His parents, aunts, uncles, older cousins are very heavy drinkers as well. Every gathering, everyone always gets superrrrr drunk. Well, I think it?s unusual. I?ve been around alcohol my life at family parties of course, (for context I?m Mexican American so culturally, beer is always present at parties.) But my SO?s family drinks pretty heavily in my opinion. And another thing, if you know what I mean, is always being brought out by the end of the night. They?ve been offering my SO drinks since he was 16 & getting drunk with him since then. Through the years we been together, i noticed that when he drinks it?s an issue. But recently it?s been getting worse. He can never just have one drink. It?s always the whole case of beer, or the whole bottle of tequila, when he buys beer it?s never just one can, it?s a pack of 3. Drinking has also got him in trouble with the police on multiple occasions,been to jail twice for disorderly conduct,crashed side of his car into a pole popping a tire, and crashing into a curb messing up something at the bottom of his car. Not only that, but created issues in our relationship and with my family. We lived with my family for a couple years, but my patents started noticing his drinking issues would create problems that disrupted their home. Getting into fights outside the house while drinking outside with friends,getting into arguments with me, and getting into altercations with my siblings. Even with all of this, my family has forgave him and do love him because I do. But I don?t want them to worry about me so I don?t tell them he still has his drinking issue. Now, my parents have talked to me before about his drinking. They acknowledge that it?s a problem. But his family, does not. I tried talking to his mom, cousin, and aunt about it all together one day but they kind of just brushed it off. They basically said that considering his age, where he?s from, & what he?s been through, he?s doing great. And the fact that he has a good, steady job that he?s had since he?s 18 not a lot of people his age get, they see no issue. They also said things like, ?oh my ex drank so much worse & did terrible things?, or ?but he?s such a great dad he loves you guys, comes home to you guys every day.? So.. I?m basically the only person that can talk to him about his drinking. (My parents don?t feel it?s their place. And since the reason we moved out was because of an altercation he had with my sister, hes not comfortable with my family as much anymore because he?s still embarrassed about things he said.) I have tried talked to him about his drinking before, but he gets very very defensive. He automatically puts a guard up and tells me he?s not an alcoholic when I?ve never called him one before. I think he gets triggered because of his grandma. He?s seen her struggle with addiction his whole life, they?ve always lived together. Anyways, I?ve ran out of ideas on how to bring it up. But at this point, I?m concerned for how my kids will be affected. I love him so much & he?s a great dad, I just don?t want to him lose himself with addiction.",Alcoholism
"I'm at a bit of a loss. My friend is an interesting person with a ton of amazing traits but I've only recent learned of his drinking.
I came up for a visit and the volume of alcohol he is consuming is unlike anything I've seen before.
He passed out yesterday at 4pm in the afternoon and has yet to wake up.
The normal course of action seems to be shine a light on the problem but I'm worried he will just cut me out of his life (as he's done with his family). He repeatedly said yesterday ""this is the happiest I've ever been!"". And he feels like he can do no wrong.
If any of you were in that mindset - life is perfect, I'm perfect, I've got everything figured out - yet still drinking to excess what would have reached you?",Alcoholism
I know my girlfriend is talking to other guys and it doesn't go well with bad coping mechanisms. We were both just friends when we got made redundant last year but our bad situation brought us closer and then all the rest. Im having trouble maintaining the sober life knowing the girl I may very well love might be seeing other guys,Alcoholism
An alcoholic once told me whilst they had their first drink that they were feeling euphoric and wouldn?t stop going on about it. I?ve never felt this whole drinking. I wonder now if some alcoholics are more affected by alcohol and that?s a reason they become alcoholics?,Alcoholism
"""Where's the purpose to being bitter? The purpose is being better."" It struck me as I was peeing on this yet 30th day of sobriety, after all my well wishers begging me to not hold the glass cause they wanted to see me live and achieve what I once set out to but forfeited to the charms of 'feeling'. Funny thing is, the more often you feel, the more often you fall. The more often you think, the often you build. After the very last bullet of regrets I could take to my chest, it was like an arrow that cupid shot, or whoever. It was like a huge mechanical being finally having a source of power, slowly unfolding without wasting a jiffy, the nuts and bolts clank, the longer beams crank. It felt like a flower budding inside of me. It was almost as if that piss had drained away the last of self-pity I had. In that moment, I wasn't freestyling obsessively in my head, I even switched off my phone and hit warp speeds in thought, pulling together postulates and axioms like a mathematical mechanic of life, like I once used to. I no longer needed the drink to taste or feel hope, I now had perspective. It's as though in that moment I felt I don't need another drink ever again, I was disenchanted, not because I didn't feel the craving but that deranged need of hogging everything possible in the moment left me, the character flaw. I think I could attribute it to understanding purpose, if not finding purpose yet. I felt like giving away all the money I had too but, I wasn't that disenchanted, these bills aren't paying themselves. This is the story of when I put down my weapons, picked up my tools and told myself, ""Let go and let's go"".",Alcoholism
"i hear a lot you wont quit unless you want to. i get that. i do want to quit, i do want to stop, i want to leave it behind me. but i want alcohol too. and i hate it. i just dont know how to stop wanting it",Alcoholism
"I went to my first meeting at 25, I walked out coz of the higher power concept and went to the bottle shop. A decade later I went back and smashed it, I did up to 3 meetings a day in my first 3 months sober I was obsessed with AA.
I became a good public speaker and loved it but now I?m turned off, the people who enter those rooms call themselves sober but are addicted to nicotine, caffein and sugar and often antidepressant meds but if I state I use LSD. DMT or KETAMINE I?m looked upon as evil. Wtf do people not know Bill Wilson got sober from an LSD experience he wanted all alcos to have a spiritual awakening but it was too much so higher power was introduced. I can?t stand the fact that if I say I use psychedelic meds I get shunned it?s a joke, while they all drink so much coffee eat all the sugar there and chain smoke and a lot take meds like lyrica, what?s the difference. There should be a AA and a straight edge AA tge people who wanna tell me I ain?t sober coz I do k should be in the straight edge one and quit caffein and nicotine I?m so done with it.",Alcoholism
"My MIL was driving my SO to work, as I usually sleep to late/drink too much to drive her in the morning. I have been off work the last five days and when I am off I just stay up later and later drinking. Last night I went to bed at around nine am, about 15 drinks deep.
My MIL was hit by another driver who was turning left. I used to work in the auto industry, so they wanted me not only to pick them up, but also to give them advice on what to do. Thankfully, everyone was okay.
I had to tell my SO I was too drunk to come help. I really didn't want to say no. But, the alternative was obviously worse. A) I don't need to be drinking and driving at all, but also B) I depend on my license for my job, and I would lose it over a DUI.
My SO isn't even upset about it. Which kind of makes it worse. This is obviously what is expected of me now. Being too drunk at 11 am to help out my family when they need me.",Alcoholism
"I'm thinking as I'm writing this I must have a problem if I actively searched for this sub. I have severe depression I take meds but there is just a hole in me that can never be filled. I smoked weed to get out of my head and when that wasn't enough I started drinking whiskey and smoking weed only with backwwod for the higher effects. I know I have a problem but I'm scared of quitting even though I know it's going to ruin my health long term. I just don't know where to go what to do, should I try to do AA meeting I just working a demanding job that is killing me mentally and can't afford to quit. Just wondering if anyone is going through what I'm going through and can maybe help me out.",Alcoholism
"I need to be done drinking. I'm in bed right now thinking how much I probably have fucked up my brain and body by drinking anywhere from half a 1.75 to a full 1.75 many nights over the last 6 years.
I'm 22 and yesterday my entire body was shaking, my vision was crazy, I could hardly even talk. Made a complete fool of myself in front of two different friend groups. (I drank a bottle of gin and then went out with friends two nights ago, and then last night I hungout with different friends and wasn't drinking but I ended up having some more gin to get rid of the shakes)
Should I be worried about withdrawals? This past week I didn't drink for like 3 or 4 days and had no symptoms. I've gone through periods of time where I drink pretty much every day for a year or more, and then other times I'm drinking maybe 4-5 days out of the week. I blackout basically everytime I drink more than 7 or 8 ""drinks"" which never used to happen (I used to be able to drink a lot more and not blackout).
I've never had withdrawal symptoms but yesterday (and a little bit today) with the crazy shaking, headache, vision, balance etc. really worried me, so I don't know what's in store.",Alcoholism
"I used to love driving. The last few years, however, when I was hungover I became scared to drive, even short distances. Highways and red lights were the worst, to the point I would plan routes, even a mile away, and avoid driving if I could. And I would need a few shots if I had to drive. Now, about 7 weeks out, I haven?t had issues in weeks. I can even drive long distances again (hundreds of miles) to places I?m unfamiliar with and enjoy it again. Did anyone else experience the driving anxiety? I am talking about fear shaking at times.",Alcoholism
"I have reached the bottom and am starting to taper but need to look at how much I consume to do it safely.
I had an average evening yesterday, got drunk as usual but because I was keeping track I probably drank less than normal.
I had 26.9 units in Guinness yesterday. I've worked out the amount and I consumed over 6 litres of Guinness. I'm a bit shocked but haven't really thought about it before. Also over 2000 calories which explains why the fact I don't really eat doesn't help me lose weight.
I'm determined to stop but it's scary to find that is an average day for me. Think the tapering will probably take a long time.
Hoping that sharing this might get some people to look at how much they're drinking in reality.
Nothing but love and respect for people on this path with me.",Alcoholism
"If you can tell me that there is no force greater than you, then go ahead and show me you can overcome gravity and fly.
Face it, as alcoholics we are our own worst enemies. We need someting bigger than ourselves to quit. Most of us simply don't want to but even something as simple as someone's disappointment in us is more of a force than our own will when it comes to cessation.",Alcoholism
"I am a 22 year old man and i have been struggling with depression for many years now.
After covid came 2 years ago i started using alcohol as a distraction at home while i played videogames. I did this as a distraction.
It turns out that i do it more and more often. I usually bingedrink on the weekends. Some times every weekend or every other week.
So i have been doing this for 1-2 years, and i was wondering if anyone has experience with how much alcohol and for how long to develop damage to the liver or the kidneys (indirectly).",Alcoholism
"I've been a regular user of spirits since I was a teenager. I've never really had a problem with stopping for a while, and have always been on top of drinking too often etc.
This month I think I've been hitting it a little too hard. Drinking 2 bottles of vodka in about 3 days. I woke up a couple days ago and felt really low. I kept an eye on my mood all day until I had a drink, and I think I felt better when I did, so I woke up next morning and poured the entire bottle away.
It's been 2 days and I feel super low, and a little bit dizzy/disoriented at times. Am I experiencing withdrawal?
Sorry I know this is probably a wrong place to post, but I can't speak to my SO about it, as she suffers from extreme depression and I don't want to worry her, and my parents would only worry as they're 4k miles away, and that's not fair.",Alcoholism
I?m a highly functioning alcoholic. I recently turned 30 and want to quit or at least slow down my drinking. The weekends or days off are the hardest for me. All I want to do I sit and drink. I?ve tried to limit myself but can?t seem to do it. I?m not a violent drunk so that?s not the issue. The problem is this costs too much money and my family is damn near broke. Multiple maxed out credit cards. Anytime I feel like we?re good and have a little breathing room I spend the money on beer. I constantly hate myself for doing this to my family. I?m just looking for advise from someone to help me achieve quitting.,Alcoholism
"I?m 21, I?ve been drinking since I was 13. The past 3 years it?s taken an especially large toll on my mental and physical health. I?ve had it, I want to quit but it?s so hard. Just needing some support or words of advice.",Alcoholism
"I don?t drink and neither does my family so idk anything about this. We are gonna call my friend ?jack? for privacy purposes.
Background: I threw a big Halloween party. Jack was on the basketball team, and so many people at the school would be talking about the party, I knew I had to invite my whole team. Jack is a grade younger than me, but old for his age, so he had trouble making friends in his grade. He was also a bully and a weirdo growing up, however that changed when he got to high school. I?m straight, but He?s a pretty attractive dude and he?s tall and an athlete and stuff so all the girls who never knew who he was flicked to him at my party. He was very drunk, but nothing terrible. Just a normal teen who got really hammered. At the time, there were rumors that jack was touching girls inappropriately but nothing arised from that. At my party he met a pretty and sweet girl - in fact it was the girl I?ve had a crush on my whole childhood to this day. Forgot to mention that one of the sexual assault rumors was about Emma (said that she was assaulted by jack) but they started dating so it wasn?t believable and they were both drunk. Idk about Emma but jack didn?t remember much about that night. That next week, jack gets too scared to talk to emma (possibly indicating social issues) and their interaction was very awkward in front of the whole team. Apparently they started talking and snap chatting, and eventually they started dating despite this weird encounter. This was a surprise to all of us because Emma was the most popular girl in school, and Jack was a random guy a grade lower, who was labeled as weird.
Recent events: The next red flag was on a randoms sunday. We had a elimination playoff game the next day, but jack was sending Snapchat videos to our groupchat and he was clearly wasted. Keep in mind it was a school night too. And he was only with his brother, that?s it. After he sent us those videos, we were all talking in the group chat and he proceeded to unnecessarily use racial racial slurs which made us all feel uncomfortable although the slurs didn?t affect us. he also decided to hit up seven girls that night. He has a girlfriend who is very pretty, nice, and popular yet he still did this. I still have no clue if she even knows about this. We told him to stop but he had no remorse and acted like nothing happened the next day. A couple weeks of practice, and playoff games goes by and our season is over. However, one of our teammates happens to be throwing a party on a Saturday (yesterday). When I get to the party, I see Jack absolutely hammered. I don?t know if this is insulting or not, but he was acting like he was mentally disabled / special needs. I?ve literally never seen someone get that drunk, and he wouldn?t even pull trig. He was completely out of it, not speaking English, and just very weird. It was very embarrassing for Emma at first, but she just thought he was very drunk. Then peoples start talking at the party, and rumors going around that he is touching girls again. At this point it kind of makes sense because of how drunk he is. So me and some of my teammates are trying to get him to throw up so that he will calm down, yet he won?t do that. We leave through the garage door so he can throw up outside, yet he just wouldn?t listen to us. He?s very very strong, so we were trying to hold him down while he threw up and he just pushed us off of him and sprinted for the door of the house. Once he was at the door, it was locked so he knocked and a girl opened it. I kid you not, like a lifeless human with no control, as soon as this girl open the door he grabbed her coochie. Like I had a perfect angle and saw it with my own eyes. I was so shocked I didn?t know what to do and I felt so much guilt for not protecting her but I had no clue that would happen. He proceeded to do stuff like this the whole night, and eventually someone got him in their car and took him home. Emma was devastated because word spread, and for other personal reasons about their relationship.

Is there a mental disorder that describes Jack? Maybe something to do with alcohol? His whole family is kind of weird. His dad especially. He?s also normally a really smart and hard-working kid, he has all A?s and takes hard classes and stuff. But he just gets so hammered, starts touching women, stop speaking English, and no disrespect but he starts acting like he has special needs. I assume Emma and Jack are going to break up now, so I won?t be seeing much of him around since the season is over and he won?t be at our parties anymore. But I?m worried because I?ve never seen anything like this before. Please let me know what you guys think is wrong with him because we are probably going to get in contact with his parents.",Alcoholism
"So I went grocery shopping in withdrawal. My last drink had been about 3am that morning, and it was after 4pm, so enough time for shit to get weird. I was (I thought) shopping normally, not doing anything outwardly odd. I was just checking my shopping list on my phone to see if I'd got everything when I see someone coming up close to me in an otherwise empty aisle - this pisses me right off. It's just decency, especially in a pandemic, to wait until someone has got what they wanted and moved away before you push in too close for personal space and reach in front of them. But it was a shop employee. She looked at me weirdly and said ""hey, are you ok?"" Confused and too taken off guard for my usual deflection, I said ""uh ... yes?"" She then said ""A lady just said someone in this aisle needed help. "" I said ""not me"" even though I was the only one there and just left. In case I was doing anything fucked up and was too far into withdrawal to know about it. Alcoholism is ridiculous. Got to put a stop to this shit asap.",Alcoholism
Went like 2 or 3 drinks too far at a social event and started saying slightly off shit. Nothing to lose sleep over but I just cringe so hard at myself and feel sad that sober I sometimes struggle to form relationships but drunk I am a little too shameless,Alcoholism
"I am genuinely asking.. Why do alcoholics keep the empty bottles around. Why not throw them away? My house has all these empties hidden everywhere and I keep throwing them out. I don't understand if you're hiding the consumption, why keep the giant bottles? He has plenty of time while I'm at work to ""dispose of the evidence"" . I know most alcoholics tend to keep the bottles, so it seems to be part of the alcoholic tendencies.",Alcoholism
"I have a job that I go to 5 days a week; I don't drink during the morning or afternoon. I drink every night exclusively starting at 9 pm; during this time, I will usually have four glasses of wine measured at 5-6 fluid oz. Lately, though, I have found myself having five, which is more than I usually drink, maybe even six if I'm really bad. A couple of months ago, I was only having 3. So far, I am functioning like I usually do. I go to work, attend my MBA classes at night, get fucked up at 9 pm day in day out. I feel like I am living dangerously, but I can't see myself quitting wine anytime soon. It helps me relax even though I've been feeling groggy and guilty in the morning. I have a bottle of naltrexone on my shelf that I've never taken after reviewing the Sinclair method. I have had issues with depression, panic attacks, and anxiety in the past, and I am on an antidepressant. I am not having any professional, academic, or social problems, just internally. Part of me wants to quit, and part of me doesn't. Any advice? Am I just living on borrowed time before everything turns to shit?",Alcoholism

I haven't been counting up to now. For me it was easier just to go day by day. But it's now been 189 days. Anyways I won't send a big message to people saying how it made my life better.

"My mom has chosen alcohol for many years, pretty much since I was born. She was good at hiding it for a long time, but after a while it was just obvious. Shes also homeless.. she sleeps on friends couches. None of my siblings nor myself could take her in because her alcohol issue was so intense. She got mean, she would steal money from people, manipulate people for money. Do anything she can to support her bad habits. She recently got really sick? and went to the ER. They diagnosed her with cirrhosis of the liver. My siblings and I saw her paperwork from the hospital and immediately went to see her.. well when we finally saw her? it was so bad. She was jaundiced. Her muscles were gone.. she was skin and bones. She couldn?t walk, or talk. She was confused. She looked dead. It was so traumatizing to see her like that. We immediately took her back to the hospital where they were able to diagnose her with liver failure and gave her 3-6 months to live. However, we all feel like based on her current condition, that she doesn?t quite have that much time.
I never really had a mother-daughter relationship. She never really called me to tell me she?s proud of me and didn?t do the best job of supporting me when I really needed it. But she?s my mom? I don?t know how to process this. We weren?t close but she?s spent the last four years calling me and balling her eyes out because she was wasted and wanted more money. I hold so much guilt. I couldn?t keep choosing her bad habits. I had to chose myself at some point. But now I feel awful.
Has anyone else gone through this? How do you go through this? How do you get better?
I know death is a thing. I know this happens and will happen. But I?m only 28? I didn?t think this would happen so soon. She?s only 59. Im so mentally un-well right now? And there?s nothing I can do to stop it. Death is imminent for her. Im so scared to experience this.",Alcoholism
"I can?t remember if the 2?6?s originally lasted me a couple days or so, but you get my gist. Do I really need medical detox to taper off of alcohol?

"So my wife (mid 30?s) otherwise has a good life - we?ve got a happy marriage, we both have good careers and great lifestyles. My wife sometimes has minor anxiety, but no other issues.
She regularly (except on work days) drinks a bottle of wine - sometimes a bottle and a half - in a day. She?s otherwise physically healthy and regularly works out. I don?t think she?s an alcoholic - she can easily go extended periods without drinking, and doesn?t drink to get hammered - it?s more of a consumption pattern. Initially my concern was with cost - she?s spending around $6k a year on wine, but that?s about what I spend on my hobbies so I can?t really complain. I can?t argue that it?s affecting her health either, and other than my concern, it hasn?t effected our marriage.",Alcoholism

It didn?t trigger me per se, was just kind of sobering and weird to be face to face with it out of nowhere.

"M24. So long story short, I?ve been a moderate to heavy drinker since I went to college in 2015, after graduating college I cut back a decent amount but still would consider myself a heavy drinker. I developed AFIBatrial fibrillation 3 times in the past due to binge drinking, the 3rd time they caught it before my heart went back to regular Rhythm (the first two times my heart went back before they did an EKG). My cardiologist told me I need to significantly cut back or stop drinking. I went from drinking 3-4 nights a week to 1. Felt really good about myself and even though it was 1 Night I?d have 5-6 drinks, I was drinking nowhere near how much I was. Fast forward 4 months and I had another AFIB event the day after I drank. Basically realized that in reality, I can never drink more than 1 drink in a sitting and can only do so most likely a handful of times throughout the year. I?m extremely bummed out and was really content with my 1 day a week. Now I feel like I?m grieving something I?ve lost that was a big part of my life, I realize this is the power alcohol holds over people and I?m trying to look at it like a blessing in disguise. Just wanted to share and rant about this experience.",Alcoholism
"My mom has been an alcoholic for years and also suffers from an Ed/depression. My dad would be ok with it if she drinks maybe one or two drinks, but she always can?t control herself. Since I?m still a minor I have to live in a toxic household. They always scream and fight. I feel so numb at this point, and I don?t know what to do. My aunt put together a little intervention about her drinking problems. This did not help at all and now she?s done with her shit.

"Like I got broken up with a month ago after a two year marriage we're still trying to figure out the divorce but I've been drunk every day since she left me and I work at this ski resort (not anymore because I went to a party last night and I'm way too fucking hungover to go into work today and I lost my phone so I'm just done I guess) but look alright I've been drinking soooooooo much just to alleviate the anxiety of not being drunk. I'm gonna get fired. For sure. But there is this good place where I live and I'm kinda thinking I should go. I've been a drunk for as long as I can remember. Only recently it's gotten bad.

I?m a 20yr old female I?ve been drinking about 4 5% wines every day for the past 2 weeks I was wondering if i stop today will I have withdrawals?,Alcoholism
"Back to day one. I feel very shaky although better after some water and electrolytes. I have zero desire to drink ATM. I'm looking at that as a positive.
I've been around recovery 20+ years. I continued to have anger issues and social struggles even after years of sobriety. I got my diagnosis of ASD a few years ago and doing some self study (and medication) really has helped.The problems with social skills and being part of a tribe has really hurt me, particularly in the workplace. The failures I've had in the past have deeply affected how I feel about myself and my willingness to put myself out there for others. These feelings in turn trigger horrible urges.
Right before I got sober this time, I decided to get off my medication I take for what's called 'meltdowns'. I did discuss with my psychiatrist and he was ok with it but within a few weeks I crashed and burned. The worst happened at a job I'd had for a year and luckily it was seen as an aberration. Having that come back has affected my mood for days and I feel like such a flop and failure for having this issue.
Friday was such a tough day, I started the day feeling down. I had another medication my insurance refused to fill unless we got them old labs. The clinic wouldn't fill an interim prescription so I'm feeling the effects of that now. I found a not so expired vial and going to do a self injection (which I've done before and have all the stuff) but not fun.Two people who were supposed to show at my house for some work either didn't show or showed 5 hours late. No actual phone calls, although one sent a text I missed.
I had posted three times on another board and got no response for days when I was beginning my crash and that bummed me out worse than not reaching out at all.
I realize my sobriety, my responsibility. It just kind of sucks to repeatedly feel like you're on the outside wherever you are.",Alcoholism

I've just never experienced a withdrawal like this, but it does align with my drinking.

In November 2020; I got pregnant with my 3rd child and honestly it was so hard to quit drinking.. I slipped up A LOT of times in my first 24 weeks of pregnancy. My child is perfectly healthy and happy, thankfully. The minute I was having back pain and knew I was going into labor the first thing I thought of was asking my best friend to bring a shot. I waited a week.. she is now 5 months and I drink everyday, all day. it went from double shots, to half pints know i drink a pint or sometimes 2 of importers everyday.. I do sometimes share with my friends.. but when I see how they take shots then I see how much I take makes me feel like crap sometimes. I do drink when I wake up before eating but I use pepto besmo so I have a coating at least. I want to be sober, but I also can't let anybody else find out that I drink this much let alone drink in general. My husband says I have a problem but I honestly feel like sometimes I don't but I also feel like I need to stop drinking as much and go back to just social drinking..

She is the source of most of my mental health issues and she just makes my life so numb. I?ve tried talking to her countless times but she?s in denial and doesn?t believe she is an alcoholic. But if getting drunk on wine every single night and passing out isn?t alcoholism then idk what is. I don?t love her. And I don?t think I ever have. I blame her for giving me trauma and not giving me the childhood I deserved. And I hate her for it. I will never ever forgive her. The second I get my high school diploma in January I?m out of the house. I do not care if she will hate me forever, but I refuse to live with her anymore. She can ruin her life on her own.

"Alcoholism runs pretty rapid through my family. That's nothing new but my brother has really been slipping into it lately especially dealing with life stress. He's the oldest and doesn't have as much ""under his belt"" as his two younger sisters. We both moved out and moved on and built lives for ourselves. Not saying it was easy or perfect but that's something he just never cared to do. He would rather stay in his hometown and drink his life away. Ny cousin gave him a room nearby the city we moved to. He finally grew up. Was working full time, paid off all his debts, stopped getting drunk every single day. Then he meets a girl and they end up moving in together. His ex comes at him for child support after 6 years of zero contact. He jumps around job to job for a bit finally settling at a delivery company. Gets in a fight with his girlfriend since she stopped taking her pills and went off the edge and took off. Boom DUI. Now he's dealing with that stress, lost his job, can't pay child support, car needs to be fixed and every time he goes out with his friends he gets smashed and talks about killing himself. I tried to get him to get counseling but he refused so I had him talk to a doctor about getting anti depressants. They worked for both my mother and myself so I was really hoping they would help. I don't think he's gotten worse but I just don't know what to do anymore. His friends keep calling me and telling me the things he is saying and I can't babysit him all the time. What do I do?

"My friend has recently started drinking alot. This is a big concern as she has borderline personality disorder. Which makes interventions near impossible. She is a frequent partygoer, and drinks from 8pm til 4-9am usually. She is 19 so this is looked at like normal behaviour where i live. What is not normal is how frequent she goes drinking, she goes atleast 3 times a week, and there is no stopping her. Its gotten to the point where this lifestyle has ruined some big plans for her. Her friends and i started noticing it being a problem when she called one of my friends up stating ®this has gone too far¯, ®im gonna kill myself¯, ®i cant stop¯. The morning after she brushed this of like it was nothing. Today i found out she has been sick(most likely covid) but she wont get tested because then she cant go drinking tomorrow in a party bus for a friends birthday party. Its gotten to the point where she is drinking to dampen alcohol withdrawals. When we try to rationalize with her she says ®im happy¯, ®i dont need to stop¯, ®its not a problem¯(yet she stated it was a problem in the phone call, begging for help and saying she cant stop).

"27 year old male. Drink 4-6 beers and at least 4 generously filled glasses of whiskey a night 3 -4 night a out of the week. Normally I'd drink more but I need a day of rest to recover from the damage I'm doing.
I have a really annoying dull ache in my mid to upper back on the right side that sometimes goes in between the shoulder blades. I used to think it was from smoking but I've had several chest x rays over the past couple years and they said I was clear and didn't suspect anything with my lungs.
I realize now it always gets bad when I drink and I drink alot. Binge alot too. This ache I realized could be my liver. Currently haven't drank for 5 days and the pain has went down but is still achey. I was wondering what is the likelihood this pain is coming from drinking and has effected my liver or kidneys or pancreas or gallbladder. Idk. I took 6 months off from boozing . And it did get better and only resurfaced after I fell of the horse. I just want to know if there's hope to fix myself. I don't want cancer or a broken organ or anything. Is it possible to rebuild? I don't like who I have become. The pain is especially bad at night time. Like a constant pressure and ache. I'm not gonna be drinking anytime soon. And I'm working on quitting smoking.
Also my diet is filled with alot of fat and greasy foods. Lots of healthy fats. But also lots of fat greasy ones.

"I'll preface this by saying I've been an alcoholic most of my 20's. Drinking until drunk every night for the past 6 years. I initially started drinking because of chronic insomnia that no sleeping pills helped with. Whereas alcohol would knock me out. My usual drinking routine was an 8% tall boy/6% tall boy and a 16 ounce 5.5% a few hours before I went to sleep. I never drank during the day. This Christmas my family bought me a bunch of alcohol and I went on a binge for about 2 months drinking a lot more than my baseline. I tried to cut back but failed every time. I have very little impulse control. I was waking up with anxiety so bad I had to just stand in front of a mirror and talk to myself to not have a panic attack. I felt like I was dying until I drank. I decimedical ded enough was enough. Watched loads of videos on how to stop drinking and visited this sub and the Stopdrinking one.
There was no way I could cold turkey and I don't have the funds to get a detox so tapering was my only option. The past 2 weeks I've drank only enough to stave off the withdrawl. I got down to one light 4% tallboy sipped over the course of a few hours. I'm now about 75 hours without my last drink. I had some anxiety and heart palpitations but my withdrawl was pretty mild compared to how it was before I tapered. Around hour 72 without alcohol I started having the worst anxiety I've ever felt. I'm 3 hours past that and it is still really bad. I also have a really bad headache and can't stop fidgeting. My back is killing and I have had a lot of pains in my chest which I saw was common in withdrawl. Every video/article I read said that the worst of the withdrawl if you don't have Dts is within 72 hours and it gets better the longer you go abstaining from alcohol. But I am feeling much worse than before.
I don't know if it's the anxiety but I feel like something is very wrong. I don't have access to a car but I could maybe have a family member take me to the doctor. I read that you should not try to stop using alcohol if you're a long-time user without benzos. I am wondering if that ship has sailed. They will see I'm 75 hours without a drink and just send me home. I've had to get up multiple times writing this to try and calm myself down but I just feel really awful. Is this normal? I don't know what level of withdrawl I'm in but my anxiety is making me fear the worst. I really feel like I need the benzos to calm my body down.

I know these can all happen, but with every website I saw that was truly fear mongering (talking about brain damage, comas, etc) it didn?t give full context in a medical way and let my imagination wonder. And there was this big ?Call Now!? Button floating at the bottom calling my name.
As humans, we have to think of other humans incentives. The website/business?s job is to make money. They make money by admitting people into detox/rehab. Freaking people out a little gets people to call.

The reality is that you're going to feel like garbage for 3-4 days in cycles. I wish I had known earlier that these feelings would pass and become farther and farther apart. I can't tell you how many times I relapsed after a month.",Alcoholism
"I?m 21. I just turned 21 about half a year ago, and before I turned 21 I was always afraid of becoming addicted to alcohol because of the easy access. I started drinking around September of 2020, I was in a really abusive relationship and started to find happiness in being drunk. I drank a lot and it was pretty bad, but when I went home for winter break (I?m in college still) I stopped cold turkey for about a month. Everything was fine, I didn?t even feel an urge to drink and I just thought ?maybe everything is alright?. My bf ended up getting arrested early December for DV which was really rough. I started drinking again around January and since then have gotten drunk pretty much every day I was able to.
I hate this, but I also can?t find any other way to stay happy or ?distracted? I guess. Every moment I have free time it?s like ?I should just get drunk?. I can?t find an excuse not to. I?ve always kind of been a perfectionist so I tend to get all my work/homework done as soon as it?s assigned and then just use that as a reason to get shitfaced in the middle of the week. I?ve been in therapy for almost a year. I started EMDR with a new therapist a few months ago but I?ve honestly been too scared and embarrassed to even mention any of this to her. I feel like a complete fuckup but at the same time I don?t want to admit what I?ve been doing and want to keep doing it cause it?s the only thing that makes me feel okay.",Alcoholism
"I will make this as short as possible. I became a bad alcoholic, withdrawals, drinking in the morning, and a bad liver and all that, and sought help and have been 11 days sober. My partner, who I have 2 kids with (big reason for me quitting) drinks almost every night. She doesn't have the same crippling problems I had like having to drink to curb nasty withdrawals, or liver or health issues, however she still continues to drink. During the waiting period for the detox program I did I was so anxious, worried, depressed, ashamed, etc. and she told me she would stop drinking on weeknights at home with me. She has failed to do so and is trying to hide booze and its really easy to tell when she is drinking. I don't like her when shes drinking and I am sober, and I feel so alone in my home. I shouldn't feel that way when it comes to a significant other.
Anyway, I just wanted to vent. I feel really disappointed, not necessarily in her, but with the situation in general. I kinda had a feeling it would be this way, and it just sucks. As a newly sober person, its quite a shitty feeling. I don't have much hope for her at the moment. I need to attend AA meetings, and meet sober people. I currently have like one friend I can do a couple sober activities with. Other than that, everyone I know drinks all the damn time.
Sorry for venting, If anyone else has had a similar situation holla at me.",Alcoholism
Hi drank pretty heavily last year. Anywhere from 12 to 18 beers a day to cope with OCD and PTSD. After getting some treatment which I am still currently in I have cut back greatly.

"My dad is an alcoholic of 5+ years. I see him in person bianually and always explain that I know he's still drinking and it shows, but he just cannot quit.
Its come to the point were he constantly goes to get bloodwork done to monitor his health, whilst not admitting to his doctors (or himself) that he is an alcoholic.
Its come to a point that his bone marrow is so trashed that his white cell count was below 200, and the doctors though he had contracted HIV.

"Before I start my post, I have no intention of completely quitting. I know, it's a very fine line to walk, but a life without being able to relax with a couple drinks and some weed isn't a life that I would find enjoyable. For context, I'm a 22 year old male college student. I got drunk for the first time when I was 17 after my ex broke up with me. I raided my mom's liquor cabinet and tried various forms of liquor, wine, and beer. I ended up getting shitfaced in the middle of the day off scotch. Ever since then, one of my favorite social activities has been drinking. It used to be where I'd get drunk maybe two or three times per month, just on weekends hanging out with friends. By the time I turned 19, it had increased drastically to nearly twice per week. On those days that I was drinking, I was consuming 8-12 drinks in a night. I'd kill a bottle of liquor in a week. From my 20th birthday until my 21st birthday, I consumed not a drop. I quit for a whole year, because I found something better. Weed. Around my 21st birthday, the weed stopped being enjoyable and I began to experience high amounts of anxiety. After then, I had a month-long period of complete sobriety, until one day I decided fuck it, let's have a drink. I had about 6 or 7 drinks with my friends that night and had the time of my life. After then I was back to drinking about once per week with my friends. Since then the frequency has been increasing more and more, and my tolerance has gone up. I began smoking weed again after I discovered that if I drink before I smoke, the weed becomes enjoyable once again. Since then, my drinking has gone from once per week, to twice, to three, to now close to 4 times per week. I'm getting drunk every other night, and when I do, I can easily kill half a bottle of liquor or at least a 6 pack of beer. I'm not at all concerned about the weed, frankly I think it can help me with my drinking. I'm just concerned about how frequently I'm drinking, and to how much I consume in a night. I'm afraid to tell my parents about this because they WILL use this against me and massively overreact. I believe that I can control myself, I just have not been trying hard enough. I'm going to make a dedication from hereon out to not drink more than once per week, and have no mre than 6 drinks in a night. If I fail to do so and fall off the wagon, I will tell my parents and commit to sobriety. I'm giving myself one last chance. I will also be seeking substance use therapy through my university.

"Any insight from those who?ve had loved ones struggle or who have struggled themselves is greatly appreciated.
I am concerned about my husband?s drinking habits. A bit of background: we?ve been together for nine years and married for about two. When we first started dating, we did a fair amount of binge drinking together as a lot of 20 something?s do, as did a lot of our friends and peers, but by age 30 or so, I had essentially grown out of it. A big part of this was me resuming treatment for ADHD after years of pretending I didn?t need it. (As a note, I have never abused my meds bc they?ve allowed me to have the life I want; husband has no issues whatsoever with me taking them and doesn?t view it as ?drug use,? so I?m doubtful this would play into the situation). Anyhow, I?ll have one or two drinks maybe once a month at most. It just doesn?t make me feel well after a few. I?m also extremely health conscious, though I always have been, so it?s not new to him. I?m not sure if this is relevant or not, but we were both drinking somewhat regularly by jr/sr year in high school.
Since we?ve been together, he always drank, sometimes to excess, in situations where the cost/benefit didn?t make sense to me, such as staying home to watch basketball or having a few drinks during a lunch out. I guess to me, drinking was pretty much exclusively for having fun with friends. When the pandemic hit, he started drinking more, which I assumed would pass. About a year ago, I went back to working at the office while he continued to WFH. I think things got much worse at this point. If I had to estimate how much he?s been drinking since, I?d say 1-2 nights per week of notable binge drinking, and maybe another two nights of lighter drinking (2-3 drinks). I do suspect there may be more drinks consumed outside of my awareness. He knows I?ve been growing increasingly uncomfortable with the situation and could be hiding some of his consumption; I have definitely ?caught? him low key carrying drinks out of the kitchen and up to his office (evenings, not daytimes). I also knows that if he meets a client or friend for lunch, he?ll say he had two or three drinks.
A few other potentially important points: he has driven impaired many times and always promises he won?t do it again. Afaik, he hasn?t recently, but that may be due to less activity in general during pandemic and moving very close to the subway. He has blacked out numerous times in the past year (ex: went to a show, never came home or contacted me to let me know, and eventually called to say he passed out on one of my friend?s couches). He just came home from a bachelor party, puked on the plane home, and spent the night on the couch whining about his nausea and heartburn. He also neglected to make sure the cats had fresh water and enough food at their scheduled mealtime.
As his drinking has increased,he has been very depressed, irritable, and unmotivated. Sometimes he lays in bed for hours or nestles on the couch, complaining about being depressed and unmotivated. He isn?t taking care of himself- gaining body fat, especially around his midsection, not exercising regularly, eating takeout often bc he won?t prepare food on a regular basis, and his hair, which always had a little gray, seemingly went nearly full gray over months. I?ve observed him visibly trembling, which I suspect may be mild withdrawal. Occasionally, I smell an acetone-esque/almost grandma-perfume type smell coming from him.
After writing this post, I?m sure I have reason to be concerned, but if anyone can share how they handled a similar situation, what the outcome was, what helped/what didn?t, I?d be so grateful. Is this what alcoholism looks like? I?m constantly stressing over this.",Alcoholism
"So I?ve developed a very bad relationship with alcohol at University. I have always enjoyed drinking and would get drunk 1 or 2 nights a week when going out for the night with friends. This new problem all stems from a breakdown of my friendship group last year, and now my social anxiety stops me making new friends. I am socially isolated and this has made me depressed. I rarely leave my room and hang out with people - and when I do, I feel like I need to be drunk.
It?s so easy to get alcohol when you live alone that I just buy 1L bottles. Because I?m socially isolated, bored and depressed most of the time, and have basically no friends to go out with, for the past month I have been getting drunk alone basically every night. Like it is really bad - I will sit in bed and drink shot after shot alone, and sometimes go through half a bottle in one night. I did an alcohol questionnaire and worked out I?ve been drinking about 100 units/week. I don?t drink during the day so it?s not affecting my uni work in that respect, apart from the fact I am usually hungover, feel like shit and this stops me from being productive during the day.
After embarrassing myself on a night out last week and having to be pulled out the club toilets by the bouncer (I have no memory of this), I have recognised this is bad and I?m trying to stop. I also started noticing increased tolerance in the past few weeks. I?ve been 3 days sober so far because I was worried I was becoming an alcoholic. So far I?ve got no withdrawal symptoms and I actually feel slightly better mentally and physically - but I can?t stop thinking that I want to drink. I don?t even think it is physical craving I am just bored and feel like life is so much more fun being drunk. I just feel like I?d be having so much more fun right now if I was drunk.
And I?m not sure if I have a problem with alcohol or a problem with life. Anyways, I think I?m gonna keep at the sober thing for a while and then I?ll see if drinking in moderation works again.",Alcoholism
"I know that might sound crazy. Lately I have been finding myself frustrated by my partners drinking habits, how he is when he is drunk and how much he drinks when he does.
He has always been a drinker and it has caused him a lot of serious problems in past. Dwis, fights, issues in relationships, etc. He has come a long way, but I still can't help but find it to be problematic. While he has settled down and no longer engages in risky and dangerous behaviors. He still is a heavy drinker. What's weird to me is that he doesn't drink at home ever. If it's just us spending time together and we are out somewhere he doesn't binge out. However we have never gone out to eat without him getting a drink. Never. Any social gathering requires lots of drinking. Work meetings/dinners lots of drinking. He will hang out with his dudes and they can quite literally drink from noon until the next morning. What's conflicting is that he is unaffected by hangovers. Owns his own business and is very financially well off and functions highly. But when he drinks on weekends or business trips he seriously binges, to where he is vomiting and passing out, and then is sober all week. So his excuse is that he has control over it and that he decided when he wants to drink heavy. But I personally believe he is dependent on it.
Myself and our friends have tried to kindly bring this to his attention but he seems to think it isn't a problem. But our relationship suffers, and others seem to notice too.
When someone drinks heavily, yet still functions where is the line drawn?

"My friend that I go out to drink with has a problem that's much bigger than I thought. They just lost their job yesterday due to being drunk at work. They called me last night and told me to meet them at a bar. They were already trashed when I go there.They stayed the night at my place and are an absolute wreck from loosing the job. They want nothing more than to have some drinks and wants me to open a bottle of wine, since that's all I have in the house. They're not ready to stop drinking and I don't think has connected the dots in their head that they have a problem, despite the current circumstance and also having wrecked 3 cars over the last few years (no dui though)
What is the best thing I can do at this current moment? I'm worried that the daily drinking will cause some withdrawals if they don't have some thing to drink, won't seek help to help them through that, but I also don't want to be the one furnishing alcohol to them. What can I do longer term? They won't listen to me if I start discussing them having a drinking problem.

"Was in a meeting a week or so ago and there was an addiction counselor who shared. She mentioned when one experiences trauma, it teaches the person that people aren't safe. This begins the process of isolation when one learns to depend on themselves instead of finding safe people to be open with. As time goes on, further trauma(s) may continue to solidify these findings and thus, isolation continues.
She went on to outline that the social aspects of A.A. instills safety back into people and that's the opposite of isolation: fellowship. Being open, honest, and vulnerable people reverses the effects of isolation. Sometimes quickly, sometimes slowly.
I've been chewing on this since I heard the share but when viewed within my own life, I see it working in action in the absolute best ways possible.",Alcoholism
"Been sober for two weeks now. I had horrible withdrawls, shaking, rapid heartbeat, terrors. Librium (a benzodiapene) has helped a lot with that so far.
Disulfiram has been a HUGE help for me. Motivation is hard. I have stopped taking ""forgetting"" pills and then waiting two weeks to drink again. But it has helped me a lot. Crucial is also to stop drinking caffeine for me.
And artificial sugar is causing an interaction with disulfiram resulting in headaches. Artificial sugar is a ""sugar-alcohol"".
Disulfiram also slows down the breakdown of caffeine, one cup of coffee now becomes two cups! Thus causing an increase in anxiety and an increase in the need to drink to bring the anxiety down. Caffeine is addictive too mind you!",Alcoholism
"Six months into our relationship, my husband stopped drinking on his own. That was October 2020. February 2021 he was diagnosed with epilepsy after suffering 2 grand mal seizures. He was put on a drug, keppra, that has stopped the seizures but we do believe it has altered his (our) life for the worse. Right after this diagnosis we found out we were having our baby. Around summertime 2021 I started having suspicions he was drinking again here and there. It?s always the same. He would leave to run an errand and when he came back, his behavior would be totally different, his smell, etc. He always denied it. This started to become more frequent and come Fall/Winter, it really became a big issue for us. Him gaslighting me. Rage issues. Finally after a night of him behaving as if he was blackout drunk, (but still convincing me I was crazy and wrong) the next day when I confronted him in a for sure sober state, he finally admitted that he had been drinking at times to cope and he didn?t want to tell me, because then he knew he would have to stop, and he felt that was the best thing for him at the time. This was just a few weeks ago. For probably about 1.5 weeks, I didn?t have any instances where I was questioning again. But it started back up. He leaves to run an errand and comes back acting completely different. Talking all over the place. Smelling strongly. (He uses mint flavored toothpicks and always comes back with a red bull. I believe that these items are covers.) Getting angry at times,being mean. These behaviors are really not like him. I am very worried. Our relationship is kind of deteriorating and it makes me feel very lost and confused. He is also on multiple psych meds in addition to the seizure med?none of which he should be drinking on. Because of all of his previous gaslighting I really don?t know what to think or believe anymore. Am I crazy? Am I being unfair? Do I just ignore it? How can it even be dealt with or addressed if he is in fact doing so, if he isn?t willing to admit it? How can I best help him but not lose myself in the process?",Alcoholism

There was an infection, and a lot of bruising, that has since resolved once I started taking care of it.

"I've been a beer drinker for the past 28 years (since about the age of 16, and I'm now 44). Almost every weekend I have had drinks, sometimes during the week too. For the past 3 years, I've been drinking my own homebrew pretty much every night of the week.
I've never had any health problems from drinking, well, unless hangovers and blackouts are classed as such. I'm generally ok with a few drinks, but come the weekend and if I go out with friends, I have a bit too much and can't remember some bits due to the blackouts. It's embarrassing when a friend asks if I remember that thing we talked about last night, or something I did, and I have to say no - I don't remember.
I'm also fed up of waking up every day and not feeling too bright and just plodding through the day, waiting for my next fix that evening (I very rarely drink during the day).
Last week, I decided to try to not drink during the week, and had the plan to just have a couple on the Saturday night as I was out for a meal with friends.
I did quite well to not drink at all Monday to Thursday. Come Friday I had a few in the evening at home, nothing major. Saturday, I started drinking at about 6pm, and carried on until 5am Sunday. Then drank a few more on Sunday evening. It's now Tuesday, and I haven't drank since.
This week, I'm going to try to do as I'd planned for last week - Saturday night only.
I'd like to drastically reduce the amount of alcohol that I drink. At this stage, I'm not sure I can give it up completely, I don't think I even want to. I do enjoy a drink, but as I get older that feeling in the morning after the night before is starting to take its toll on me.",Alcoholism

I drink nearly a full bottle of gin everytime. The next day I feel so anxious that I drink again to get rid of it. I feel like I've lost control and I'm so scared and alone. The only person who's stuck around for me is my mum but I lie to her and say I'm not drinking as much as I am. I hide my bottles of gin in cupboards so that if my mum calls in she won't see it. I go to different shops to buy my gin as the shopkeeper knows my mum really well. It's the anxiety. If I could just get rid of this constant debilitating, consuming anxiety then I wouldn't need to drink to feel safe. Because its the only time I feel safe. When I'm sober I'm scared all the time. When I'm drunk nothing scares me. If it weren't for my kids I would end it. I've been struggling for so long and I don't see a way out. I feel so alone and so scared",Alcoholism
" I've struggled with alcohol on and off. I've always been a big binge-drinker and used to be unable to ""stop once I started"" and loved partying, especially when I was depressed.I went to college and had some health problems and removing myself from my drunken hometown environment and feeling physically terrible made me sober up for a year or two. Then my job sucked and my relationship imploded and I started hanging out with my childhood friend/drinking buddy/soulmate again. We've been friends since middle school and drinking buddies since 16. We have a lot in common and would arguably be great together. But he is a serious alcoholic who has only gotten worse with time. He used to always drink heavily, but remained fun, charming and alert. Now, he doesn't eat, blacks out, pisses his pants, falls down, slurs incoherently and acts like an ass to me.This has been a long one. We really love each other and have a fantastic friendship where we play music together and he's one of the only people I feel close to. I've been unable to remove him from my life, we're both depressed and even though I drink more reasonably these days, I still have THC daily. After a serious talk about him getting help, he got wasted af like 6 times in one day and was falling down, saying he was sorry and done drinking all 6 times. We met up on Friday and I told him I was upset because we can't have a functional relationship because of his drinking. He threw some hurtful shit from the past in my face again and I realized that he is normally kind to me, until I question his alcoholism and drinking. Then he attacks me where it hurts. He's fun to be around and sexy until he gets wasted. He doesn't show up for me or support me. If I'm not around/willing to party, he will find another girl who will. I've been very hurt by him, but still love him and want to help him. We're not talking at the moment after a failed attempt at Valentine's day.What kind of healthy boundaries should I start setting up, or should I let him go? He insists that he's truly in love with me and I know I love him, but I have so much hurt now and I know it would only work if he was sober. But I don't know if he has it in him. I know he loves alcohol more than me. Even if it couldn't work out romantically, I love him as a person and as a friend. But also don't know if I could tolerate being his friend if he remains this way. From an alcoholics perspective, what can I do, what should I do? What do you wish your partner's had done to help you? What can I say? Should I quit talking to him after a lifetime together? Am I a fucking idiot?",Alcoholism
"Did anyone else absolutely get their ass kicked by PAWS about 30 days in? I felt great in weeks 3-4 and anxiety hit me like a bus after 30ish days. This is day 2 of feeling terrible but not nearly as bad as yesterday.
The timing may vary... I've quit on many occasions and the last 3 have given me physical WD symptoms (abated with RX). I'm kindled to hell. More so wondering if anyone else goes through cycles of feeling like they're back to week 1 or 2.",Alcoholism

"I'm going to spare the backstory. It's not irrelevant, just trying to keep this brief. I (M31) have been in a relationship for 6 years. I coincidentally lost control of my drinking 6 years ago. I tried my best to manage it, which of course I couldn't do. I felt ashamed and embarrassed, and scared she would leave. I eventually got 'caught', since you can only explain away so much. After I got 'caught' my girlfriend and parents pretty much let everyone else know - my friends, her parents, and so forth. That made me extremely uncomfortable, but I swallowed my pride and did what I knew I needed to do, since they were just trying to help me - I quit drinking.
I made it nearly 2 years, but continued smoking pot and not really working a program. I am not sure that AA is for me. I do credit smoking weed with helping me get to the 1 year mark, but as I approached the 2 year mark, I genuinely decided I wanted to just be sober. I quit smoking, but was stunned at the difficulty of the withdrawal process. After multiple nights of not sleeping, extreme irritability & anxiety, I drank. It was an ugly relapse, and oddly enough, it seemed like it happened in the name of sobriety. Anyway, here I am. I feel pretty uncomfortable because it feels like everyone on the outside is looking for me to start working a program, since that's what I was not doing last time, even though I had a good streak. I made it nearly TWO YEARS without a drink, and no one was pressuring me to do anything differently, despite the fact that I was stoned every single day. So I quit smoking, relapse on alcohol, and it feels like my parents, my girlfriend, and even her parents, are waiting to see if I will start working a program, basically citing my lack of AA as reason for the relapse in the first place. I now have 32 days since my relapse, no weed, no alcohol, not even coffee. Yet, my girlfriend's mom literally asked me if I am now in recovery. My girlfriend is continually asking me if I'm going to go to meetings. I'm supposed to meet with her parents and let them in on my situation, which I understand, but it really weighs on me. They are wanting the best for their daughter. But I'm just really uncomfortable with everyone feeling like they know what's best for me. I made it two years without a drink and I am proud of that. I slipped, as people like us do. I picked myself back up, now better than ever. I haven't been this sober in nearly 15 years. And I'm loving it. I realize there is a pink cloud potential, and all that. But I suppose this is why I'm writing. My girlfriend is saying that she doesn't want to 'just wait around' for the next relapse. And I don't know what to say to that. I genuinely don't feel that attending meetings will necessarily prevent another relapse. I try to be blunt with her, and understanding at the same time. She truly has been so supportive and is trying her best, despite not having any experience with this. I know it's not fair for me to make promises like ""I'll never drink again"" just to make her feel better. I've told her that if it's too much for her, then maybe it is just that - too much for her. I can be harsh in that way, self-sabotage is my middle name. It's just easier to leave than to be left behind, you know? I care for her deeply and I actually had plans to propose this year. As I said, I'm 31, been together for 6 years. I was 2 years without a drink, everything was going alright. Then I relapse, and it feels like everything is back to square 1, even though I don't really feel that way. Do I give her what she needs and give her a break, knowing that she isn't equipped to deal with this on her own, but is trying? Or do I honor my own inclinations and feelings about what I need, and see how the dust settles? I'm torn between understanding that relationships are about compromises, but also knowing that the truer you can be to yourself, the more likely you'll succeed in the long run. I underpromise and overdeliver. That's who I am, and what feels fair to myself. But she keeps wanting to see more action from me, in the hopes that will help her feel more assured that a relapse won't happen again. I want to help her, but I don't think jumping into AA full swing is the answer for me. Again, I made it almost 2 years without a drink, suffered a short relapse, and now I'm back, off of everything. It feels great, but I'm still paying for my actions. Anyone felt like this? Any guidance? Looking for some outside interpretation. Many thanks.",Alcoholism
"So over a month ago I have started drinking on nearly everyday basis, it started at the end of December. I've never struggled with it or any other substances before, the only addiction I've had was nicotine addiction, which isn't particularly life-wrecking. I wasn't expecting myself to get hooked on alcohol so quickly, I've always hated the taste of it and could have never guessed that it would become one of my favorite things in the world. When I first started drinking I almost always felt good and relaxed while drunk, but now it just makes me even more miserable when I'm under its influence. Alcohol doesn't cut it for me anymore, yet I can't imagine quitting my newfound little ""hobby"". At this point I'm just drinking it out of habit and ""necessity"".",Alcoholism

Any advice or even words of advice is appreciated.",Alcoholism
"I drink every day. It's only 3, 4, or 5 seltzers a day. Or wine, or champagne, or cider. On the weekends definitely more. In the last couple of years I have maybe not drank a total of 20 times, and usually only the day after a severe hangover.. I always thought it wasn't a problem because I know I can stop drinking, but I haven't wanted to. Now it's Sunday, February 13th and I'm sitting alone on my couch waiting to see if my husband is actually leaving me this time. Which I would not blame him to do so..
I'm 25 and have been drinking since I was 16. I had some party months and drank heavily, blacking out more than most of the time. Either at a friends house or party, or in my room with a friend. When I was 18 or so, bottles were usually supplied by my mom or dad, because hey, they'd rather I get it from them than a stranger. And I always stayed wherever the drinking started, so we had trust in that sense. Sometimes I wonder if I would have drank so much if it wasn't so accessible..
But it wasn't something I did most days until my boyfriend and I moved in together when we were 19, I think. We had the only apartment of all our friends so people were over constantly. We would drink 2-4 bottles of hard alcohol every weekend, between just a couple of us. My boyfriend, now husband, drank with us but he never got into it as much as I did. I would come home and hide in the kitchen to take shots so he didn't know how much I was drinking. We started to argue because like I said, when I drink more than 5 drinks of anything, I almost always blackout. I would wake up the next morning, not remembering a thing besides I fucked up. He would have to tell me all of the horrible things I said, the things I broke. The fucking awful person I was.
I stopped drinking hard alcohol like that, but I never stopped drinking. The blackout nights and fights always happened, but more spread out. And I'd like to think it was around the start of covid, but much before I started to drink every day. I come home from work and almost immediately grab a drink. I drink enough to get drunk, but not blackout. But sometimes I'll go to a friends, have people over, go out, or even at work events I will drink so much that I'm gone. It's like someone else takes over, and I have bits and pieces of memories the next day that make me feel ill. My relationship is not perfect, we fight whether I'm sober or not. But when we fight when I'm drunk, I disregard the fact that that man is my person, that he loves me and cares about me. Something starts a fight, and I explode. The night explodes. We scream and yell, and I say unforgivable things. I break shit in our home, I break shit in his car. I'm an extremely angry drunk and he takes the brunt of it all.
Last night was another one of those nights. We were driven home by a coworkers daughter who is my age and friend also, but I hardly remember anything besides wildly dancing and making an absolute fool of myself, per usual. Beyond that, I remember three moments. My husband slamming my phone so hard on the ground it shattered and bent, our friends showing up because I guess I told them they could, and my husband yelling at them to leave. And the next, I was asleep and woke up to fuck knows what. I was so disorientated, I didn't know what I saw or heard until I realized he was watching porn next to me in bed. We have a very comfortable relationship when it comes to masturbating and porn, but I felt very, very uncomfortable in that moment. We had fought all night, to which I still don't know what started it, and then to wake up to that.. Like just go the bathroom man. I know you're upset, but I'm still a person. We started to argue more, he told me he'd show me the videos of my from last night screaming and saying awful things. He said he was going to pack and leave in the morning.
He left, he brought back a new phone. Which I appreciate. And he's gone again, no bags in hand though. Our relationship isn't perfect. And I have a drinking problem. Which doesn't help. Even as I write this I question myself, but I don't want to drink anymore. I have said that before, yet I've never meant it enough to follow through. But I do not want to feel this way. I don't want to wonder what I did or said, or how embarrassing I was, or what I'm to going to say to my friend, coworker, my husband..I don't want to wonder if this will be the time he actually leaves.",Alcoholism

"I've never been active here before and have only been reading some posts here and there and now sharing this from my second account; mostly venting, but if you can help me somehow or if you've been through something similar, I'd like to hear about it.
I seriously don't know what has been going on with me these last years, but more and more, I know that I'm acting bad in certain ways and that it definitely has bad consequences, which I simply take into account and don't even care about them coming. I allow my life to get worse and worse; I've been struggling with an alcohol addiction for about 1,5 years now - that by itself has had multiple bad effects on my life, besides health-wise of course. Not showing up to meetings that me and the other person were looking forward to, just because getting blackout drunk the night before (alone) was more ""important"" to me. I also didn't show up to my shift one day, just because I was way too intoxicated to function - then and there (on that same day) I decided that I ""want to quit anyways"" (despite really having loved that job). My place in my dorm is an absolute mess, there was a bedbug infestation a few months ago that I still couldn't get rid of to this day (although I tried on multiple, sober occassions, with a whole plethora of anti-bedbug chemicals), and instead of telling it to the people working for that dorm, I simply kept my mouth shut, sometimes even kept on drinking to forget about it and ""take care of it tomorrow""; coincidentally, tomorrow is the day, they're going to check my room two months before I move out (that's just a routine thing before someone moves out, I decided to move somewhere else after graduating). I know the drinking has caused or deepened a lot of problems, but I'm also wondering if it's not the other way around, if the alcohol abuse is not actually a symptom of something bigger going on.
(Btw I'm a 23 year old guy living in Europe, I've never had anything that one could describe as a ""healthy relationship to alcohol"", it has always been binge-drinking for me whenever I drank since around 2019. But it was around October 2020, that I started drinking crazy amounts and waaay too regularly)",Alcoholism

"I (19m) have a drinking problem. I know I?m young but I definitely had a problem, and alc is pretty easy for me to get. I really started drinking around when covid hit the when the all-state band event that I worked my ass off to make got canceled and I felt like my several months of hard work went down the drain. Pretty soon I was drinking myself to sleep every night. I just didn?t know how to stop drinking and often blacked out. I quit cold turkey in late October after a particularly bad night where I got into an argument with a dude and he jumped me from behind and completely fucked my face up. I remember trying to go for my knife but couldn?t reach it, my last thought before I was knocked out was ?this is how I die.?

"Some background: My 55 year old sister has had stage 4 liver disease for at least three years. I am honestly amazed she's still with us. She has no desire to stop taking oxycodone, drinking, smoking and hoarding. She could have gotten on a liver transplant list but she didn't want to stop drinking for 2 years.
She opted for back surgery last month to relieve compressed discs. I cannot believe any doctor would operate on her with her comorbidities. We all tried to talk her out of it but she was in a lot of pain (hence the oxycodone).
Surgery went ok but 5 weeks later she's still in the hospital. She had COVID for two weeks so no one was allowed to visit. Her boyfriend went in a few days after she was cleared and told me she was skin and bones, which she already was. She looks like a skeleton skin. It's devastating.
I live over an hour away from the hospital she is in so I haven't been here every day since COVID. The doctor said if she consistently has decent bowel movements, she'll be able to go to rehab (for physical therapy, not addiction). She hasn't eaten hardly anything for three weeks. What could she possibly have to poop out? I guess my question is how could the doctor not address the rapid weight loss until I called her freaking out about it. They brought a nutritionist in but it doesn't seemed to have done any good. I'm looking at her lunch tray. All she ate was a half cup of cole slaw. That's it. I brought her some of the small, individually wrapped peanut butter cups and she ate two.
Also, the hospital is also removing 4 liters of fluid from her belly every two days due to her paracentesis.
The doctor swears this is normal for someone who's been in the hospital for an extended amount of time. She swears she's going to rehab. What rehab would take her? I think she is ready for hospice. The doctor said no she isn't. I don't really believe that my sister will recover from this.
Of course, if there is something else going on with my sister and she doesn't want me to know, the doctor can't tell me.

"it of background - I'm a middle aged man, great family with two kids, great job earning good money. However i always had a bad relationship with alcohol. In my younger years although I only drank / binged once or twice a week I did some stupid shit, got into fights, turned into an asshole husband at times. Im really surprised i never ended up in jail or hospital to be honest.
During the covid lockdown i decided to drink moderately , i don't keep much alcohol at home. Havent binged much at all - maybe 3-4 times in 12 months. So i succesfully became a moderate drinker.
However a few months ago, i went to a friends and ended up drink driving back home with two kids. Also ended up getting in a bit of a road-rage argument with someone while doing so. No accident or anyone hurt but you can't believe how much i hated what happened and myself - never done it before and i hate people that do shit like that. I still have a problem that sometimes I dont have the self control to stop drinking. That brought me to a point where i see i have a few options before me:
Give up Alcohol completely, Only drink on very special occasions e.g. new years, birthdays etc, Never more than 2 drinks and only occasionally e.g. glass of wine with a meal. Would like to hear people's views on what they think is the right option and why as i have no idea what to do.",Alcoholism
"About five years ago, I (36f) started drinking a little bit more than I was comfortable with which was very unlike me because prior to that, I never drank at all. Then I moved to a new city to take a job in what ended up being a toxic work environment that I went on leave from and shortly after, Covid hit. Since then, my drinking has been out of control and I don?t know what to do. I?ve gone to meetings and don?t find they help at all - generally, it?s been a lot of men talking about how they didn?t really have any reason to drink but did and they take up the entire meeting where no women ever talk. I looked up female-specific groups but they?re all online which I also tried and it left me feeling disconnected. I?ve been reading on The Sinclair Method and tried the medication which even when I wasn?t drinking at all made me violently nauseous and left me dry-heaving. I have a counsellor and a psychiatrist and try to journal but it seems like I?ll be doing very well and then every third or fourth day, I?ll get triggered and go on a binge. I?m so fed up with myself and feel like I?m severely letting myself and my family down. My partner and daughter have been incredibly supportive but I know it?s taking a toll and wish I could just fix myself.

"I should start by clearly saying I?m not an alcoholic. I had a period last year after turning 21 when i was doing 2-3 glasses a wine a night, but never ramped it up into bottles. I?m writing this because I?m curious to hear how people started. My drug of choice is weed, and when I got into it I was never uncomfortable. Sometimes now I feel myself getting paranoid or anxious, but never physically sick. Alcohol for me is often uncomfortable. Sometimes i binge a bit when I?m down, but that often turns into hangover, and even if it doesn?t I often make myself feel very bad if I drink a lot. It?s probably something with personality or genetics, but I just can?t envision myself relying on this substance, unless I was stupid and eased myself into routine drinking.
I guess my question is, did you feel sick from binging before building tolerance? I can?t imagine getting drunk every night just because I feel very sick when I drink a lot. I felt like I could understand it when I was keeping wine in the fridge all the time, but even then if I went for too much I?d get very barfy and have a terrible hangover. I still use alcohol as a crutch sometimes, so I guess I?m asking all of you because I have read enough on this sub to know that alcoholism is not something I want to fall victim to. I look forward to hearing from all of you; i know it?s weird to lurk on a substance abuse sub, but I have a lot of alcoholics in the family and that?s always made me worry about myself.",Alcoholism
"I?m a first year uni student and I didn?t really drink until uni (had only a couple of drinks when I was 16). Ever since I started uni five months ago, I find myself drinking weekly as I go out clubbing or to a pub with my uni mates nearly every weekend.
As I started drinking more and more, I increasingly became more violent. I punched my male flatmates in the back multiple times on multiple occasions. I called multiple people names, but I mostly call one of my flatmate?s the c word even though he?s one of the nicest people I?ve met. I was throwing around horrific swear words at people for no reason. I?ve thrown tiny glass bottles on the walls of our kitchen. I kicked my flatmate in the leg so hard he had a bruise. I run off somewhere else and that?s how I lose my friends. It just goes on.
We?re in a tiff about something else and now it?s awkward between me and my flatmates. Shit finally kinda hit the fan when my flatmates pretty much expressed that they?re now uncomfortable going out with me. They say that they feel like they have to look after me constantly which would ruin their night. I always ask the next morning if I ruined their night and they would say ?no? but I know that?s a lie.
I had a talk with one of my flatmates regarding my drinking and he pretty much said that I am a completely different person when I?m drunk. He described me drunk in these words: ?You see red?. He told me all the things I do whilst drunk and I was horrified, as I would never do any of those things sober. He said ?You?re a lovely person sober but you?re so angry and aggressive when your drunk? and he states that most of the problems in the flat are due to my drunk actions towards other people.
I would just like to know what the reasons for me being a completely different person drunk could be? I do have issues going in and I handle them the wrong way through drinking and aggression, but I am also wondering if this is how I am as a person and my drunk ness reveals the real me? I also sometimes think I can be a boring person so I would drink so I can be a bit more exciting and energetic to be around with.
I am also seeking advice on how I can chill out on my drinking but still have a good time.

"Throughout the pandemic, my (30F) relationship to alcohol has become toxic. Since October I have been trying to cut it out of my life with decent success.
Unfortunately my husband (29M) has been pushing against my decision. He brews craft beer for a career. He doesn?t understand why I cannot just have one drink, and I have been honest in saying ?it?s never just one.?
For me personally, as soon as the buzz hits I want more until I can?t see. This past weekend I blacked out on cheap wine and lost a day to the hangover. The slip up has me embarrassed and angry, but has my husband pushing again. Does anyone have a way of communicating how it?s impossible to just have one?",Alcoholism

Had a long talk with him where he confided in me that he is an alcoholic. He's been sober for half a year now...up until recently when we started dating.

"Background: My stepfather has been addicted for many years. He knows, been to detoxification twice and is attending a group of addicts every week + therapy. After so many years of toxic behaviour towards my family - specially my mum - it was a relief. Now, like so often, he began to drink again. Because he ""cant sleep"". My mum is so done, she just got her second diagnosis of cancer in one year and she cant handle him anymore. She cant just leave as well because like I said - she just batteled cancer and cant work, + they have a son together which makes everything more difficult. Long story short, she asked me to have a talk with him after I defeated Covid. I really dont know how to talk to him because I was just so happy that I got out this toxic household almost ten years ago (I am 27). I get along with my dad now that I am no more around to be the Punching bag. I love him but at the same time I despite him for what he is doing to my family. The last thing I want is to destroy any progress he made in the group and solo therapy. Any advices what to say / what not to say so he may get back on the path of healing?

"But last Saturday I put down 750mL of Jager by myself with no negative side effects other than a very, VERY mild hangover the next day. Does this mean I have a natural genetic disposition towards alcoholism if I can naturally process that much alcohol without it being debilitating? I had it on a relatively empty stomach and didn't even hydrate at all that day, not to mention that my tolerance should be next to zero since I don't drink often enough to develop one. The only lingering effect that I have is some memory/concentration problems which is worrying but I'm willing to attribute that effect to my tendency to be neurotic and falsely attribute my problems onto events that had nothing to do with it. The crux of what I'm asking essentially if the same amount of neurological damage/physical damage is being done to me as ""everyone else"", but im just not able to overtly tell?

"I got out of inpatient treatment in July then I was in an outpatient treatment that kind of focused on AA as a means to lifelong sobriety. I went to AA because it was a requirement and it was just what I was supposed to do. I did go to AA because it was a requirement for treatment and I started working the steps. And I just kind of realized AA really didn't seem to do anything for me. I didn't really get anything for what people shared. So, I just kind of stopped. I haven't noticed any difference in my sobriety. Part of me just worries if I will have long term sobriety without a program. I am nearly 9 months sober now (which is the longest I've ever been since legally able to drink)

I wish I could say I stopped for me, but I stopped because what happened to him scared me and I wanted to support him. its been 5 months since then. I used to drink hard liquor. I don't anymore. I told myself after a few months wine is okay. and for a while it was! i was only having spritzers, and on weekends. I'm fine, right? I don't drink like my dad did, right? I can control how much wine I drink. it's easy! WRONG.

"So I do get some withdrawal symptoms such as shakiness and sometimes I feel like I get the cold sweats.

"I have been with my boyfriend for five years. The entirety of it has been a roller coaster due to his alcoholic tendencies.

Each time I have had a conversation with him, I see small inklings of improvements, but never a complete turn around... essentially skating on the bare minimum to ?appease? me.
This time I have issued an ultimatum, no drinking and go to AA or therapist, or I leave him. He is obviously not taking to this idea well. He is throwing anything at me to find my weak point. Begrudgingly telling me he?ll do it, but I couldn?t possibly love him if I?m issuing an ultimatum. Blaming me for ruining his lifelong dream of becoming a beer brewer.

"I (33F) have been dating a man (36M) for 7 months. On Sunday, I drank to the point of blacking in and out with him and my friends from 10AM to 3PM (bday brunch at a house). He drank but did not get drunk. The host kept pouring sparkling wine, and I just kept drinking it. I hadn't eaten. I couldn't fully remember getting home - my BF drove. I remember getting home, and I remember we had sex, but I don't remember all of it. I apparently went to bed and woke up at 8PM, at which point I couldn't remember going to bed and I was very sad/upset with myself for wasting the day and losing control. My BF was nice to me and got me water, but then he was very distant on Monday and Tuesday. Not responding to bids for affection verbally or physically.
On Tuesday he told me this is the third time I've done this in 7 months, and the frequency of it is something he can't handle. He says everything about the relationship is wonderful (I mostly agree), except he has a real issue when I'm drunk. Except for the 3 times (a music event, and 2 bdays), I stick to 1-3 glasses of wine on weekends and the occasional weekday.
I also very much want to moderate my drinking to prevent ever blacking out again. It's something I've wanted to work on before dating my BF, for my own health, even though it hasn't impacted work and no-one has ever brought it up to me. I'm a calm, kind person, but my BF says I start to personally attack him and get mean during the blackouts. He said on Sunday, I gave him attitude about him driving, where I eye rolled and was like ""obviously you're driving"", and then I told him I was annoyed with him about something he did earlier that day, but I didn't want to talk about it. To me, these things seem not ideal, but also not horrible. As in, I too don't want to get blackout or be rude, and I'm sorry. But, I've never called him a name or purposefully hurt him, so I guess I'm just scared that if I slip up and drink more than 3 drinks, for example, then he'll be distant or break up with me, even though I also want to stop the binge episodes too.
Also, every time I've blacked out, my BF has been there, and each time we've had sex once we're home during the blackout. I remember pieces of it, and so it bothers me that he's willing to have sex, but is also upset with my behavior. After blackout 2, he told me his mom was an alcoholic and so it triggers him to have to take care of someone, but he can't relinquish control back to me because I'm his partner now, and not single, and he just can't do that. Question: I want to reduce the chance of me blacking out to 0% also. I love my BF and I want him to feel happy and comfortable. I'm just afraid that my boyfriend is acting like what I've done is terrible, and I'm trying to strike the right balance. I'm scared of being possibly manipulated into thinking I'm worse than I am, but I also want to take ownership if I really am doing something terrible. Ultimately, I want to solve the problem. Any advice?",Alcoholism
"I don't really know how to start, but I'll begin by saying I have been drinking nearly every day since maybe 16 or 17? I'm not sure exactly how or why it started. I think I just liked the feeling, and then I let it take over my life.
I turned 25 recently and it's really hitting me. I knew I had a problem but my self justification was always ""I go to work every day, I have a good job, I do what I'm supposed to, I have a home and it isn't affecting my life""
I don't exactly when it started but I drink until I black out atleast 4 or 5 times a week. I wake up for work at 5am feeling miserable, feeling like I may actaully be dying. I feel Iike absolute shit and I tell my self every morning I'm not going to drink today. The first 5 maybe 8 hours of my shift I still feel that way, but as 7pm (clock out time) eases closer and closer I just think about the liqour store closest to my work. (I obviously know where it is) I clock out, go to my truck, and try to push the thought from my head. It never works. I drive to the liqour store and buy my drink of choice, and I can't even wait to take a few drinks before I leave the parking lot. I get home, maybe eat maybe not, it depends on how drunk I am or hungover from the night before.
Then repeat the next day. On my days off I do the same, I don't wake up and drink. I don't even think about it, once again I think about quiting drinking because I feel like absolute shit and know I am destroying my body. Most days I don't start craving a drink or thinking about it until the evening. Then, without hesitation I go and buy my bottle for the night. All the while, in my head, or even sitting in the parking lot of the liqour store I sit there and contemplate what the fuck am I doing.

he's had a drinking problem thats gotten worse over the past year. he's been in therapy for a few weeks now. i just learned his therapist told him he needs to commit to being single before he can get sober. i asked how he feels about her suggestion and he said, ""i am afraid to be alone. but i think i agree that i might need to understand what that means"". so uh yeah im really sad now. i said to him, i understood from the moment he started developing these issues that his personal well-being should come first over our relationship. meaning, i knew we would have less hanging out, he would give less affection, he would need alone time, he might need to go to inpatient care, etc. i want him to take care of himself.
i explained this to him, i said i just want to be here to provide the love when he needs/wants it, and for him to know i am here just for him, all of my love is for him. i am with him to support him thru all of the highs and lows. i explained i dont have any expectations romance-wise. i just want to enjoy the moments we do get to have. the occasional sleep over, a random cute text, whatever, ya know?
i am okay with this idea. im not interested in becoming interested with anyone else so it's not like he is holding me back from having a more available/attentive/whatever partner. it doesnt hurt me that he has to put more time into himself. i understand he would need to be able to accept that too.
idk whats right or wrong medically speaking. if we were married would she be telling him to get a divorce??
unfortunately i do feel really sad about this. i feel like a decision is being made without my full input, but isnt that just what breaking up is? maybe i dont have a choice and it really ultimately doesnt matter how i feel? because being an alcoholic could really kill him. i cant stop crying.

The amount of money I sink into alcohol every week is disgusting. I can't moderate any more. It's ruining my body, my sleep, my brain function. I push through and push it down and everyone thinks I'm still doing excellently. But then I have a girls night and even though I only brought 1 drink with me in order to force myself to moderate I end up drinking stuff that gets pulled put by the host and there goes my plan. I end up oversharing and telling them something I really should not have. Now today I'm filled with dread. Do I text my friends to do damage control? Ignore it until next time I see them? Are they texting about it today talking about me? I have a pit in my stomach about it. And I wouldn't if I just hadn't been drinking.

The other sobriety sub talks about finding things to do to replace the drinking. Well, what am I supposed to do when a large part of my drinking is bc my life is monotonous. Work from home, get toddler from daycare, come home, play for a min, make dinner, watch tv/play w toddler, bedtime, watch tv with husband. Day after day always the same. I can't go to the gym or exercise all the time to like they suggest when I need (and want!) to be parenting and spending time with my kid. I'm constantly stuck at home and I'm bored. Going one night a week wouldn't stop it, bc when I was going to the gym one night a week I'd still grab wine on the way home. Drinking just makes everything less boring. Drinking is just always with me while I do the regular life things. How do I extricate it when it has become a part of the process and practically part of my hand?
But I'm sick of feeling like this, very mildly hungover while working and feeling anxious and depressed over my actions. I have to figure out ways on my own. I can't ""replace"" the drinking time with something else since I was drinking while doing normal day to day family/house routines. Those will always be the same and I have to just I don't know, play the tape forward. Remind myself of feeling this way. Talk to my therapist. Dive into my hobby more to get out of the house more regularly. Anything. I just can't moderate anymore, and I'm not going to be this person.

I said then despise of my addiction, I will not drink it. But now I have a very difficult time with my partner. He drift apart. It doesn't matter why. He still loves me. But now I had beer and want to continue with his tequila. I will buy another bottle tomorrow, so he won't noticed. But I feel bad.

My parent-in-laws assure me I?m making it up but I?m not. My husband sees it too but with the situation we?re in currently (recovering from covid that got passed to us from a family member) we haven?t been able to get jobs and safely move out. And because of this unsafe feeling and constant anger towards me I?ve really wanted to drink again. There?s a bottle of wine in the pantry. There?s a bottle shop within walking distance.

My wife's grandma is in ICU and she's probably not going to come out of it, so I'll actually be able to be present and here for her. Somehow she stuck through it with me. She always had faith in me and supported me to the best of her ability. My brother lives with us too and he's 6 months sober in NA, so our whole house is sober now. He even gave me his 30 day chip when I hit 30 days. I don't go to NA or AA or anything, but I've been to meetings before so I know how much it means. I hadn't really talked about this with anyone IRL, so I just wanted to get it off my chest. Good luck everyone!

"Just as the title says, I have been waiting 6 months to get in. I have actually maintained my sobriety just because I made a huge commitment to stay sober.

So I stay sober from anywhere between 2 and 11 months and then I binge for a week or 3. That's my m.o. I am trying to break that cycle. It's hard, I wish those guys would bring me in but Covid has the wait times being astronomical, well that might be a bit of an overstatement haha They're making me wait! There making everybody wait! It sucks lol I get it, covid, reduced beds, long wait times. It's basically going to be like vacation. I've been alone in my one bedroom for the past 9 months. Out on a work injury for a year. So I am trying to get into treatment before going back into work. I really hope I get in sometime soon. It's been really hard on my own. But readings, prayer, meditation, cbt, these are some of the tools I use to maintain equilibrium. So I am happy and I am doing alright. I would just really like to get into treatment haha. Home life is hard dude. Even when I am working I'm just not a wealthy guy. So now since I have been out of work for a while its like I am feeling it. I have more than enough to get by. And I go and walk two times a day to a drop in for free food. For the exercise and to just keep myself afloat until I can get back to work. I do what I gotta do right. But I am looking forward to being in there for a hot minute. Even if it is hard, which I am sure it will be in its own ways, its going to be different, it will be fun and challenging in new ways.

In Nov, friendless and desperate, I went to rehab and was 34 days sober until Christmas.

I feel completely trapped and powerless to change anything at this stage.

"I'm 22 and I've never done any drug in my life til last week, when I bought a 6 pack of spiked juice after my psych appointment. I was going to a party the next day so I wanted to see my tolerance, since the day before I went to a party -- fully sober and all -- and it was awful.

Drinking 2 cans alone did nothing except make me dizzy. The next day during the party I drank more, and eventually it became amazing!! I was talking so much and having a great time. I have severe social anxiety disorder which I take meds for, and although I felt nervous still, it was like the non-obsessive benefits of my meds + easing up on my self-control from alc made me feel so much better. I feel like my true, normal self when I'm drunk. Seriously, everyone was saying I am a happy and fun drunk -- in sharp contrast to my usual serious, shy self -- and I felt it too.

I've been drinking every day since then, but not to the point of getting as drunk as I did during the party. I took just 1 day off. Before I took the day off, I went to work, met with my boss and did a job interview all while kinda tipsy. I think all those things went way better than they would have if I was sober. But I still felt bad because I know it's not good to do those things while drinking.

I also didn't get any hangovers or other side effects besides dizziness when I'm drunk or tipsy. But I'm vision impaired so I'm always kinda dizzy and knocking things around.

I know I should probably stop so I'm scheduling extra time with my psychiatrist to talk about this. Alcoholism runs in my family, and my grandmother is homeless because of it. But I love the feeling, and I have always been so depressed and shy my whole life. Therapy hasn't worked much and the meds only help with some parts of my anxiety. The rest really feels like some kind of deficiency in my brain, like I have too much self-restraint or something which leads to extreme avoidance.

Are there any alternatives to alcohol or how can I drink in a healthy way? I don't really have any friends and no one to talk to besides my psych. I heard benzos give a similar effect, and I could probably get them since I already have horrible anxiety. But honestly any advice would help since I've been feeling like I reached a ""high"" that I can't ever get back to unless I drink again.",Alcoholism

"My girlfriend is a very casual drinker. She gets drunk maybe one every 2 or 3 months and rarely ever has a drink outside of that, but she's also very small and has a low tolerance.

About 6 months ago she went out with a group of friends and got black out drunk. Her friends estimate she had between 10 and 20 drinks and we're surprised she didn't have alcohol poisoning that night.

Ever since then, anytime she gets drunk or high (Marijuana) she experiences tingling in her hands and feet and they go numb. Usually this lasts for a day and then wears off, but something different is happening.

We got high a few nights ago (VERY small amount of Marijuana. We rarely drink or smoke) and the numbness is way worse. She is relatively numb and experiencing the tingling you get when your arm or foot falls asleep, but across her entire body. We're on day 3 now and she says it's getting way worse. Yesterday it was just hands and feet. Now it's everywhere.

"i found out my mom was an alcoholic last may. she?s been my best friend my entire life. recently though, she is distant and goes days without responding to me. since last may, she has gone to AA almost every night. last month, she ended up in detox which the doctor said was probably a cry for help. now she is in an extensive outpatient program which has lasted for around two weeks now. she went radio silence on me this weekend (my dad told me she just had the stomach flu) but she just responded that she had actually drank and is now very sick. i feel like i am the only one in my family who is scared and wants to support her. my dad usually gets angry at her/doesn?t want the whole family to know because he is embarrassed. i?m pretty angry he lied to me about her drinking. anyways, i guess i am mostly looking for some reassurance that she can beat this. she WANTS to get better. but despite being in AA and an extensive outpatient program, she continues to drink.",Alcoholism
"So, I have been drinking pretty heavily for the last couple of years. I took a month off at the beginning of 2021. My withdrawals were worse than I expected. After that month ended, I went right back at it.?? Fast forward to this past week. I decided that, instead of going cold turkey, I would taper off to one drink a day for a week or so. Today marks day 5. The first three days, I was pleasantly surprised that I didn't feel badly. I went to the gym. Didn't feel super anxious. No dizziness/sweaty nights/yadda yadda. Yesterday, I felt dizzy, lots of head pressure, body soreness. I took my temp and it was 100.7. I don't have a fever today, but I have NO appetite and I still feel slightly dizzy and off. Could this be withdrawals? Maybe I just happened to get the flu or something right as I was starting my path to sobriety? It's very frustrating.",Alcoholism
"I?m 23 and have had a drinking problem since I was 18. Although I did well in college, I spent most of my days drinking alone in my room. This stemmed from the fact that I felt like I couldn?t relate to the people around me. Regardless, I?ve been out of college for almost a year now, and it keeps getting worse. I alternate between binges and bouts of sobriety. Over the past year for instance, I did a month sober, two months sober, and then another month sober. In between this I was on a binge the rest of the time. Every time I become sober, a ?friend? (I have a lot of bad influences in my life) convinces me that it will be okay to drink again, despite me describing to them countless times how much of a negative impact alcohol has had on my life. This one night out always turns into me two months later not being able to go to sleep unless I drink 7 or 8 beers. In the past I?ve always reached a low point which motivated me enough to stop, albeit with really intense anxiety and confusion for a couple of days, but it?s only getting harder and harder each time. I can just see myself really going off the deep end unless I quit forever.

I only drink at night time, and on my current binge I?ve consumed around 8 beers every night for the past three weeks (I?ve drank a 12 pack the last three nights though). I need to figure my life out and this is the age to do it. The drinking has been getting in the way big time, and I know I absolutely need to stop if I don?t want to end up a complete mess later in life. I just can?t handle alcohol. I have a few questions for you.

How much of a risk do I have for serious withdrawals requiring medical attention? (I?ve only been drinking for three weeks on this binge and was sober for a month before it started, but the horror stories online scare the living daylights out of me)

What do you recommend I do to prevent myself from convincing myself I can drink and relapsing again? (I can never make it more than a month or two)

What should I do about my friends (who are also alcoholics but won?t admit it to themselves)?",Alcoholism
"I wish I was never friends with this individual
Ok to make a long story short when I was 23 I lost my best friend and sister to cancer. I struggled with life for a bit. I met a friend S who was a few years older than me but had no job. I tried to be a good friend and took her to several job interviews. My friend S had a problem with alcohol. I was in the middle of grieving so for awhile I turned to hard core partying with her. I had never been a badass and was always a rule follower. Quickly I realized I turned into a massive AH. Fortunately the turning point was when I received a job offer in the legal field. My lifestyle had to stop. I turned my life around and stopped binge drinking. My friend S ended up getting into drugs and even stole my prescription meds. That was the final straw of our friendship. Over the years, S has tried to get me to be friends with her again. I refused. In my hometown where S lives we have a community page. I have moved away. The other night I posted about a very bad accident. Underneath the comments section was S?s mom saying I needed to quit judging people and that I?m on a high horse. She then went on to say I have ruined her daughters life. I have not had any contact with S besides these FB messages that occur every couple of years. I also after the comment was made I received a message from her mom saying to quit being an asshole. Ofcourse this got people in the community talking so I responded to S mom that I was friends with her daughter in 2010, don?t have a high horse and am not perfect. Then blocked S mom and made sure daughter was blocked as well. People in the community have sided with me saying that S mom was wrong for bringing that up on a community page. I feel for S and I wish she would get help. Since friendship ended she gotten her 8th DUI and she even a charge of endangering children. I?m a different person now. After getting these messages it made me want to move even farther away from my hometown and old life.",Alcoholism

I?ve been an alcoholic for over ten years now but I toned it down a lot. In my early 20?s I was blacked out all day and drunk at work. These days I go to work sober and drink after and from morning to night on the weekends. Last night I drank a lot more than normal after my girlfriend went to bed. Today I was sober and we went with my girlfriends parents on a day trip. While we were walking to a restaurant I just randomly passed out and fell on rocks and really hurt myself. The pain was so bad I kept falling over even after I came to. I?m just trying to understand what?s going on. I?ve never done anything like this before.,Alcoholism

"I start drinking in the evening and most of the times it ends okay. I wake up in the morning still feeling like a looser, but I at least didn?t down an entire bottle of vodka.

But any time I get on the phone with someone at night (which is why I try not to talk to people at night) or when my sibling comes to stay the night, I just end up taking it to an extreme level. Always, always end up blacked out and even before I really wake up I know immediately I?ve fucked up so badly, feeling the crushing effects of hangover and extreme anxiety about what stupid shit I even said or did. It?s literally the worst feeling ever. Ever ever. Yet I still keep doing this shit.

If I talk to people during the day I end up shaking, sweating, feeling so much anxiety. So a lot of times I just never answer my phone and everyone always complains that I?m ?the hardest person to get in touch with?. Well what they don?t know is I avoid them because it stresses me out and I don?t know why. I have a lot of resentment towards cell phones. I don?t want one anymore. I?m so sick and tired of people expecting that I should answer just because they called and they are getting mad. I?m sick of being tied to this device. I wish I could go back to the days of landlines where it was not expected people would answer and we just had answering machines for that reason. People didn?t generally get pissed when they didn?t get in touch with you. Now days it?s like because I have a cell phone people think I?m looking at my phone 24/7 and ignoring their call on purpose.

That?s not true I?ve tried to make an effort to be off my phone and sometimes I lose track of where my phone is even at. But yes, there are times I see someone calls and I don?t answer it because I?m not in the mindset to talk.

Anyways, the time will come where I see someone calling in the evening and I know I?ve not responded enough and I feel pressured to answer so I do. I answer or call them back and I start drinking right away. And then no matter if the conversation is good or bad, I keep knocking back the shots. To an extreme degree that I don?t do when I?m not talking to people. It?s like I can?t have a conversation and be normal, or not stressed, unless I?m drinking. But then I take it too far.

So then when I wake up the next day, the entire day I?m cringing and freaking out about the stuff I remember, and panicking about what I possibly did that I don?t remember, hiding from my phone, logging out of my social media because I?m terrified about what stupid shit I?ve said and I can?t even face it. I can?t even stomach to see notifications. It?s crazy.

Like why?. How is it I can go through that all day and then when 7pm hits, I?m back to drinking again. Thinking I can somehow only have one or two drinks when that?s never going to happen.

I really, really hate myself. It won?t be long before everyone I?ve ever known and a bunch of people I don?t know hate me just as much. Obviously there?s no good answer here other than getting clean which I feel is absolutely impossible at this point. By the end of the day I?m so extremely stressed out and feeling pain in my body it feels impossible not to drink to make it all stop. But I also get so pissed off at myself that I can go through so much torment all day about what I did while drinking then just go and do it again and again and again. So stupid.",Alcoholism

"?m 31. Been an alcoholic for 13 years. I?ve decided to quit. I am currently 6 days in.

I feel I?ve gotten over any initial withdrawal symptoms. However my issue at the moment is the ritual nature of the habit. I used to have a very set regime. I?d be at work 8-7 most days. I?d never drink at work or whilst working from home during working hours. However I would then drink on the way home and for the rest of the evening. Life was literally split in two.

I?m finding that period between leaving work and getting home/ eating dinner the hardest. I?m just getting the constant feeling of wanting a beer. I haven?t succumbed yet but just wondering if there are any tips to take your mind off it. I?ve so far avoided the gym as I used to basically drink on the way home after. However once I feel I can trust myself more I may return.

In my mind I have the reference of quitting smoking. I quit a few years ago. I found then that the initial pain of quitting was far worse than what I?ve experienced with alcohol. However after 2-3 weeks that nagging feeling of habit and wanting that cigarette eventually went away and I just naturally stopped thinking about it.

So I?m wondering 1. Any tips on how to get over the pangs and 2. Does it go away over time. Realise that?s a somewhat facetious way to express this but I can only frame it in the context of my experience with smoking!",Alcoholism
"He's been an alcoholic for as long as I can remember. Last spring it got really bad and my family and I put him in rehab under Section 35 (Massachusetts). I thought that might've been the last straw and he'd stop drinking. There was hope for a short time.

But nothing has changed. He won't go to AA meetings and he won't see a therapist. He says constantly that he wants to stop drinking that he's ""tired of living like this."" But he won't put in the work.

I'm just so done and tired. Part of me wants to keep pushing him to get help. The other part of me wants to cut my losses and get out of his life. For good. Never talk to him again. I'm just really depressed over this and I don't know what to do.",Alcoholism

Been a casual drinker all my adult life, but since COVID I find I have 2-4 drinks every day. Lately, that's turned into sipping an oz of rum when I start work at 6-7 am because I feel withdrawl in my head. I'll have another couple oz in the afternoon; sometimes it doesn't abate the feeling.

"So now I'm on 2 strait weeks of doing the exact same thing. I'm off Thursday and Friday. Last week I started drinking Wednesday night and drank three nights in a row. Saturday came, I was late for work and I suffered for a little bit before asking to go home. So fast forward I recovered pretty quickly but was in massive pain for the first night. Now this week, I do that exact same thing but stopped yesterday because I couldn't drink because I was just throwing it back up. I don't understand how two days of heavy drinking can do this to me. Anxiety is bad, chills and sweats and I have to suffer through work. I don't have the option to not work. I have a cushy sales job so I can just lay low most the day. My challenge is not to yap to my coworkers to keep my anxiety down.

I'm done. I listened to an AA meeting last night for the first time. I didn't stay the whole time but I'm getting on a program. I cant keep my life together like this. My issue is I cycle.

"I'm at 30 days today and honestly it has been a walk in the park. I used to drink a lot every day, I was up to ca. 135 drinks a week, which is 100 drinks a week more than at least one diagnostic guideline for alcoholism that I was given. I did decrease my daily amount before quitting completely, though, but I was still getting fully drunk every day before quitting.

I've had almost no cravings, I've lost noticable weight (I've also worked out a lot), I've saved hundreds of dollars, and I feel way better now that I'm not constantly a little bit nauseated. Just in case anyone is thinking about quitting or taking a break but isn't sure they can do it, it doesn't have to be torture. I've been pleasantly surprised by how easy it has been. I had like one rough day, the rest have been kinda boring, but not very hard.

I think it has been easier for me because I haven't committed to never touching alcohol again for the rest of my life. When I think about doing that, I kinda panic, so I benefit from a more casual attitude. Booze wasn't causing any huge problems for me, other than overall shitty health and empy wallet (but I have very few expenses so that wasn't really an issue), I just decided to take a substantial break (at least 3 months) because my relationship with drinking had become unhealthy. I expect to get to a point where I can have a healthy relationship with drinking again. However, if I find out that I'm incapable of that, it's nice to know that I can do sobriety without suffering. Also I still smoke weed, which helps.",Alcoholism

"Honestly it started off as me just saying I was an alcoholic as a joke. Always talking about its in my blood an I can out drink anyone. Well thats how it started then my cousin would get me booze an I started at like 15 mostly to impress this person I was seeing who was just cheating on the person they were with. I would drink on occasioan but I never really cared mostly because im an introvert an id just stay at home all the time. Then my dad moved in for a month...I though we would connect an it would turn things around, but I just saw how horrible he really is. Picking him up while he was stinking drunk an my best friend was in the car really did a number on me. Later that year My godfather died from liver an kidney failure...alcohol didnt help but I got the moonshine and so many other bottles. Eventually moved out an turned 21 so I could buy my own went to a few parties and would drink like a fish no hangovers just fun...my depression started to get worse after I moved to the big city. Im such a mommas boy that it was hard being that far away and I was having issues with relationships. I was in such a bad place that when my own birthday came up I drank anything in sight did whatever drugs I could pay for an just really hoped I wouldnt wake up. The company I worked for went under.I lost my job which I ended up using some of the money for cases of booze or weed. I then moved in with my now ex. Thought it would be better but my drinking increased I was now drinking almost every night. Not to get messed up but just a buzz. Well along with my cheating and other issues including drinking we broke up an I continued dating someone else. They called me out on my drinking but I would brush it off. Saying that I have it under control an that im not an alcoholic but we would go to events an id bring booze an when we were at their place id bring booze. I kept saying that this is because I didnt have weed to smoke but once I got weed I still wanted a drink. Eventually with the issues I was already causing we decided it would be better if I didnt drink anymore because it was causing problems an cheating. This past November I started having health problems some bleeding an I got some work done well I was feeling fine an then in January when I hit my 1 year of sobriety I felt great...until the health problems came back...an I thought well if im just gonna keep feeling this pain anyway i should just go back to drinking atleast that way I'll die faster an nobody will have to worry. This caused a breakup to happen an I never take my breakup with them well. Ive been drowning myself every weekend since then. At this point idk if i even want the help I hate rehab with a passion an never wanna admit that I have a problem. Honestly I just want the booze to kill me. My meds arent working an I do not have the will to keep going.

"So I worded the title that way on purpose, I was referencing Kevin from the Office?s line about few words doing the trick. Anyway, I?ve noticed that alcohol makes me think better thoughts when I?m tipsy or drunk, if that makes sense.

But when I?m drunk I view this as a positive and realize how good friends they actually are for dealing with my shit sometimes so I should be less angry towards them. This is not to say I ever show them that I?m annoyed, I put up a good front cuz I know good friends are hard to come by and I feel bad for feeling the way I do.

"Male, late 30s, high performer, finance exec.

Throughout my adult life I have probably drank too much, and mostly alone.

My typical pattern for quite a while would be Sat - Tuesday sober, Wednesday drink a 6 pack, Thursday sober, Friday drink a 6 pack or bottle of wine or little bit more.

Last couple of years it's probably escalated somewhat, to where 90% of days I would have 2 - 6 beers, and at least once a week have 7 - 12 beers or equivalent.

"in the rare moments of sobriety i'm intensely anxious about the health consequences of this lifestyle. and what's really funny is that drinking is my only coping mechanism for that anxiety. i wake up every day and immediately check my skin color in the mirror for signs of jaundice. i'm always feeling around my abdomen to see if something feels off. i keep going to the urgent care up the road asking them for tests to reassure me that i'm not dying. and i'm not yet, but the numbers are getting worse every time. i used to think maybe i'd be motivated to stop once i saw evidence of bodily harm but now i've crossed the point and it hasn't slowed me down at all. i'm scared dude, i am NOT the kind of person who doesn't fear death, i fucking dread it",Alcoholism
"not sure if this is the right place to post this but here I go. My girlfriend of about a year has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder. She insists she doesn?t have a problem. Oftentimes when we go out to dinner she will drink to the point she is drunk. After about two spirits she is noticeably drunk. However what is most concerning to me is how she uses alcohol to cope. If she has a bad day at work , or an argument with her roommates , or even a disagreement between us she will drink excessively. Am I wrong to be concerned about where this is headed? I have been surrounded by alcoholics my entire life and can?t help but to see her heading down this road.",Alcoholism

"I am sober 17 months and like many alcoholics there is a little bit of the brain that wonders if I could drink in moderation.

Well, yesterday, I was at hospital for a colonoscopy and instead of sedation opted for gas and air (which was far more comfortable than when I have had sedation). I took the first breaths of the gas and started to feel a buzz. It felt like a drunk feeling.

My alcoholic brain immediately took over and chased it. I was huffing the gas as hard as I could and as fast as I could. Not because I needed it at all. Purely to get more buzz. The more I got, the more I wanted to the extent as I was very disappointed when it was all over.

Lesson learned, I know this is exactly what I would do if I drank.",Alcoholism
"Over the years I have DRASTICALLY reduced my drinking. I am very proud of what I accomplished. However, I still get occasional cravings that I would like to eliminate.

Since reducing my drinking, I was able to get healthier and reduce my tolerance. In the past, I used to be in a constant state of being drunk and hungover, and both my body and mind saw it as normal. Now that I am healthier, I REALLY 'feel' the effects of drinking. It takes less alcohol to get me drunk, The hangovers are 100x worse and the aftereffects last 2-3 days!

My problem is that I like to drink in the evening/night and also have a drink with dinner. I find that alcohol compliments food very well. I want to cut this habit completely out. What are some alternatives?

Yes, alternatives. I know some people aren't going to agree with that part but I would rather do something else than deal with a hangover at work because I was an idiot the night before.",Alcoholism
"I?m an alcoholic. I know I am, I haven?t always wanted to admit it, but I know I am. I won?t lie, I?ve been drinking tonight as I write this. But the question of ?what do you do for fun living a sober lifestyle?? has always been the biggest thing for me never committing to staying sober.

Drinking has become a staple in my social life, but I can?t drink like the people around me do. All of my friends drink because they can handle their shit. They can go out and get shitty on a Saturday night once a month and have a beer or two after work every now and then. I can?t.

If I drink, I have to get drunk. And if I don?t drink, I can?t sleep. I drink almost every night, and drink excessively at that. I drink just to fall asleep. I don?t even enjoy drinking most of the time. The only time I do enjoy it is when I go out to the bars or to a party with my friends. I wish I could be like them because I know that?s the only time they drink. But when I?m not with them I?m at home drinking by myself every night.

I wish I could cut out the drinking in between the nights out and that be that, but I can?t. I?ve tried many many times. I?ve been thinking about going to rehab lately and committing to quitting all together. But what do you do when you stop? It?s so hard to imagine a social life without alcohol. Is that just the addiction talking?

Side note: I also kind of feel stupid. I know there a lot of people out there that feel the need to be drunk 24/7 and I?m just a guy who drinks nearly every night to sleep. But I do feel like alcohol is actively fucking up my life.",Alcoholism
"My dad has always spent his evenings drinking shitty beer in the garage watching a tiny tv for as long as I can remember (I?m 27 now), and then promptly falls asleep in the recliner or on the toilet. He never goes to bars to get drunk nor gets aggressive so he doesn?t view his drinking as a problem. He recently retired and it?s only gotten worse in my eyes, and any phone call after 7pm typically isn?t remembered the next day or is just slurred words.
How can I get through to him that I?m worried about him but mostly tired of dealing with drunk dad? Sober dad is great and charismatic, which makes seeing the opposite drunk dad harder to deal with emotionally. He is still married to my mom who doesn?t drink and she has always given him hell for the drinking but he never toned it down based on her issues with it from what I saw.
Alll the advice on the internet I?ve found is for people who drink hard liquor and like sneak it in their pocket and drink even at events and stuff, or get aggressive. My dads case seems mild but is emotionally still frustrating and he definitely doesn?t consider it alcoholism as he says he can go without beer, and has before.",Alcoholism

I think I am ready to stop however I feel this way every morning and by 4:00pm I am all set to crack open a beer. My wife and I try to do things to minimize our harm like taking a day or two off each week but never more than that. Every time we talk about our drinking it becomes a very stressful conversation and usually ends up in an argument.

I enjoyed the feeling. As I?ve gotten home and drank (a lot less and less often) I?ve noticed I pretty much only drink by myself or while In contact with someone digitally, and the desire to get full on drunk and feel the effects more has gotten stronger. This has gotten worse after quitting nicotine 2 weeks ago. I also get the feeling of ?man I could go for a beer? despite not wanting to make a habit of drinking. I can go without drinking, but I enjoy myself more when I have some drinks at night.

We had a rocky start to our relationship, and I stayed under the impression he was bettering himself and we would grow. He didn't drink hardly ever then. I fell for him very very fast and I wasn't ready to let him go. I wanted to see him through. Things were better for a month or 2 before he started drinking. We had a lot going on for so many reasons and I didn't really hold it against him, as long as it didn't seem like he was abusing it.

After the first time I got drunk, I got totally obsessed with the feeling. I would count down the days until I knew I would drink again and always tried to drink whenever alcohol was available. On that note, it wasn?t available often: I could go a month without drinking purely because I didn?t have the means to get it. Is it still a dependency/addiction?

"Most here know, drinking is not your problem, but it is the ""solution"" to your problem...

To those easily triggered, I ask you not to read on and know I truly hope you are finding the support and help you need, but if you read on, I also hope you see this as a story to maybe learn with, or gain some insight into the mind of someone on the outside of this terrible affliction, and that some of us DO understand you.

My brother passed away this past Thursday morning. He received a liver transplant ~5 years ago that was needed due to drinking. He sobered up just long enough to be eligible, got his transplant, and stayed sober for about a year after.

At the beginning of his journey, none of us understood the mental struggles he was battling that led him to drinking. After his transplant, we started understanding this and tried whatever it was we could to support him through it.

He was very quiet about what he was going through emotionally and mentally, so to the outside many just thought he was a hopeless drunk.

I beg each and everyone of you, many of you struggle with this horrible addiction due to the same reason my brother did, but without being fully open and honest with those who support you, you will further isolate yourself trying to protect those around you. It is also important to make sure you do whatever it is you can to break through whatever ""therapy wall"" you have that scares you from seeking the right help. I pray no one has to go through what my brother did in the end. Dying from alcohol is a tough thing to see.

Mental health is a very foreign thing for some to see and understand if they themselves do not suffer from it as well. Seek the support you need. There ARE those who will do anything and everything they can for you. You ARE wanted and loved. I am not angry with whatever caused him to struggle, and led to his life ending. I am not angry with my brother for not being more open with me. Being angry will do absolutely nothing now, so I chose to love everything left by him, and I chose to do whatever I can for others who are also going through this.

" I have a friend ? 32(m) ? same age as me who currently is an alcoholic; has been for years really. For context, my mother was also an alcoholic and sadly died in September 2020.

"Me (26F) and my fianc (27M) have been together since we were in school (ages 18 and 19). We have pretty much grown up together, school sweethearts, blah blah blah. We own a house together and recently got engaged in May 2021. Lots of fun and exciting life events happening at the moment, and things are pretty good.

However, I am starting to notice that alcohol may be starting to become an issue for my fianc. For background, both his parents are alcoholics and have a strained relationship with drink. My fianc doesn?t drink that regularly but it seems to be very linked with social situations. He won?t drink much during the week (maybe one or two beers in total) and he will often have a couple on the weekend. However, if we go to a pub, to a friends place, or have people over to ours, he will drink to excess. Easily 8-10 pints of beer (24-30 units).

When he drinks this amount, his personality changes and generally not that fun to be around. He is not physically or emotionally abusive in any way, but his behaviour changes, if that makes sense? He is more erratic and his ability to behave in a restrained manner is impaired. He will spill his drink all down him and all over the table/floor, and generally embarrasses himself. He will wake up the next morning and not remember parts of the evening behind a certain point. Meanwhile, the rest of our friends are only drinking a maximum of 3-4 pints and just having a good time. My fianc does have a higher tolerance to alcohol than some so it takes him a few extra drinks to feel drunk.

Me on the otherhand, I don?t drink unless it is a special occasion. Even then I will have a maximum of two drinks, and I don?t even enjoy it. I?m happy being designated driver, and don?t have a problem being around people drinking as long as it?s civilised.

A few days ago we had one of our very close friends (27M) over for dinner and a chat. He?s just come back from a long trip and we were looking forward to catching up. We ate and they shared a few drinks between them, but my fianc kept drinking. I lost count of how many beers he had in the end but it was easily 8+ of very strong (6% ABV) cans. It was coming to the end of the evening and we were sat at the breakfast bar in the kitchen. He thought it would be funny to grab onto my feet and tickle me whilst sat on a bar stool. Initially it was funny but when I told him to stop as I was sliding off my seat, he didn?t and I slipped and fell to my knees on the hard floor. I got some pretty funky bruises. Instead of helping me up he just chuckled and told me to get up. Our friend was very taken aback and said he would make his exit as he felt uncomfortable. He helped me up and then went on his way.

We went to bed and I when I spoke to his later the following evening after I got home from work, he said he couldn?t remember any of what happened. He was very upset and I know he would never have done it on purpose. We spoke about how I felt about the situation and whether he thought it was an issue. He said it was becoming increasingly hard for him to only have a few drinks and then stop, like there is no off switch. He mentioned feels miserable and depressed at the moment due to work and is worried that it?s becoming a coping mechanism. He doesn?t want to become like his parents.

He had been trying to better himself recently, eating healthier, going to the gym, limiting himself to a few drinks a week. Then it?s like he?s lost the off switch. Our friend has also spoken to him about his concerns and is worried about him.

I guess my question is, what can I do to support him? He says he wants to reduce his drinking, or stop altogether. It?s tricky for me as alcohol is not something I enjoy so I?m finding it very hard to understand how he is feeling.",Alcoholism

I have never had the shakes and always spread my drinks out to avoid a hangover. I also don?t enjoy being drunk, so I avoid it. I just enjoy the buzz stimulation I get (almost like motivation).

Well, I?ve realized that my tolerance has increased so much that alarm bells are going off. I also don?t really enjoy drinking anymore. It feels more like a crutch than it is an enjoyable past time. I told my wife I think I have a drinking problem. She was super supportive, and now I am looking at either the tapering route or the cold turkey route.

Luckily, I have Xanax and Propranolol to help with withdrawal symptoms. If you know of any other medications/supplements, please let me know.

My POV for tapering: It will reduce the possibility of DT?s and seizures but it?s a slower process.

My POV for cold turkey: It will be quicker but increase the risk for DT?s and seizures. I?ve never even had the shakes but I don?t know if that?s an indicator of anything.",Alcoholism
"I have drank quite a lot for a long time, 1/2 a fifth on a normal night, for the past 10 years at least. I get regular physicals and try to eat ok. However my blood work has been getting progressively worse year on year. Now my BP is very high and my blood potassium levels are high. I have tapered down on the alcohol my doc gave some benzos if things get tough. My question is has anyone experienced this and their kidneys got better.

"1 month sober. I haven't drank, been going to the gym 5 days a week, haven't even felt the impulse to drink in weeks, and I'm terrified. My anxiety is through the roof because I feel like something has to go wrong. Its always gone wrong before right? Why would this time be any different?

I've been struggling with recovery since my drinking became a serious problem two years ago and this is the longest I've voluntarily gone without drinking by three weeks. (there have been other times I haven't drank for longer but that was because I didn't have the money and/or it just wasn't available.)

Can anyone relate to this? Has anyone found a way to deal with this anxiety at the thought of relapse or just general impending doom?",Alcoholism
"I would really appreciate any guidance you can provide. I'm mid 30s and have had a drinking problem for a number of years. A few months ago, something clicked in my brain and gave me the motivation to stay sober for almost three months. I think I may have underestimated my risk of falling back into bad habits while I was in the 'honeymoon phase'.

Unfortunately, I fell off the wagon three weeks ago and am having trouble getting back to the headspace of sobriety - holy shit it was so amazing when I thought I'd made a permanent change! I'm sure this type of thing is par for the course on the way to getting sober, I'm just not sure where to go from here and how to get back to my commitment to sobriety.",Alcoholism
So I have been on a bender. And I finally have to stop. I drank wine pretty heavily. I?m about 14 hours since my last drink. And the anxiety is real. I can?t sleep I have taken a Valium. But the anxiety is still present. How much longer am I going to go through this.,Alcoholism
"I had been drinking for 40 years, the last 10 quite heavily (i.e., 2-5 bottles of wine a night).

Like many of us, I was hiding most of the drinking and terrified of stopping due to all of the horror stories surrounding AWS. Inpatient detox and rehab were off the table due to $$, but I found an outpatient clinic that required an intake appt, 5 - 15 min daily check-ins and provided a round of benzos (Librium or Valium) all for about $500. You could probably also do this with a sympathetic MD.

So, I got all ready. Bought a blood pressure cuff and a pulse/oxygen meter at the drug store. Told my wife I?d been drinking too much and was stopping and asked her to ?keep tabs on me? For a few days. But I didn?t mention all of the possible horror stories. She was thrilled.

"It's true, im only 16 and suffer from depression some months ago i tried to kill myself, and nobody helped me yet and i don't think nobody will do that cause i don't got friends and most of the therapy and psychologists just wanna money and are only doing their work. And i don't think that a person that i need to tell my name every time i go there can actually help me, this is pain described in words. After my attempt of suicide all i do is drinking alcohol and smoking cigarettes, it's the only way that i been able to escape all this pain i been suffering, but today was different... I never drink too much but today i reached a level of drunk that i probably never reached before, i was vomiting everything i had inside of me, i just didn't do more cause i got my stomach empty i don't remember almost nothing but all i can say is that alcohol is the worst, i hate this society where mushrooms and weed are forbidden but alcohol and cigarettes are fine and ok to sell around you. I drink alcohol to forget about this life and laugh but when i wake up remembering that a guy that i don't know the name brought me at home and i throw up at all my bed and bedroom i just wanna cry If you are considering becoming a father or a mother think 2 times before doing that, your kid can became somebody like me.",Alcoholism
"So I got a liver function panel test back and the levels were bad but not that bad. Bilirubin overall was 1.5, AST 67 and ALT 86. I went to the hospital the next day and they retested my liver and did an ultrasound. The ultrasound i guess showed very minimal scar tissue and fatty liver. However, my liver function test the next day had wayyy higher levels. Bili was 2.1, ALT was 122, and AST was 100. It really freaked me out. Now i have to see a GI specialist to get this further looked at. Its odd cause I have lowered my drinking (currently tapering because of withdrawals) and each day i feel a little better. Do liver enzymes go up when you drink less? like a temporary liver recovery thing? I just really hope this is something I can come back from. I could really use some input from someone who has gone through something similar.",Alcoholism

"I approached my boyfriend with the possibility that he was becoming a binge drinker and headed towards alcohol use disorder. He has compulsions towards alcohol that he gives into despite the consequences. He becomes abusive and depressed when drunk. So he tries to isolate himself. He drinks a lot at one time but can go a while in between. He's also an ex addict of drugs he won't name. He is a very different person now than he used to be.

He looked into the disorder more and says he thinks he already has it. Because he started drinking at 13. And in the past he would get black out drunk weekly and get to the point of alcohol poisoning several times a month. But always in binges. He could go days without it. So lately it's more of a relapse.

He's going to talk to his therapist today. But does anyone have suggestions for him? Or how I can show up and be their for him? I've already told him I'd he ever has the compulsions he can text me. I won't shame him or get mad at him. Becoming addicted isn't his fault.",Alcoholism

"My mum is 54. She has a successful career and is married. However, she drinks 10 drinks plus nearly every night of the week. Multiple nights she will be so wasted that my dad will have to 'put her to bed' at 8pm because she can barely talk and cant keep her eyes open any longer. She becomes so embarrassing and can often start fights when she is drunk - But of course everything is my fault and I'm the evil one if I try to bring up that she may have a problem with drinking or should stop after a couple of drinks.

My dad is a pretty big drinker, so its a massive aspect of their relationship - but recently my mums drinking has been taken to far and we both cant say anything because she will just lash out at us. She becomes extremely defensive and will come back with viscous remarks about why something you've done is worse then her drinking etc. I just don't get why she cant have a couple of drinks? Why does she need to get absolutely plastered every single night. Its not a joke anymore, its seriously upsetting, distressing and frustrating. These drinking habits have been going on since I was young. And my brother and I (21 and 19 years old) growing up and still now) would both dread ""champagne nights"" because we knew she would end up obliterated.

She gets up every morning and exercises early, goes to work, has good blood tests and lives a good life. So in her head she thinks theres no problem.

But there is right? Alcohol is causing problems in her family/social relationships, weight loss goals and sleep schedule - among other things.

I just dont know where to go from here - I cant wait to move out of my family home again, because every night I dread when happy hour starts for them at 5pm. I just retreat to my room for the rest of the night because seeing my mum/parents so wasted for no reasons makes me feel almost ill.

"I am not super aware of the stages of alcoholism nor have I ever gone through it personally, so I need some advice. My mother (43) has been struggling with addiction for as long as I (23) can remember. She has progressively gotten worse over the years. About 5 years ago is when she first attempted to try to get sober. It has been a vicious cycle since then. About twice a year now she tries to detox at home, for about a week then gets to the point of hallucinations and I finally convince her to go to the ER. She stays in the hospital just long enough to comfortably get all the alcohol out of her system, but never goes to rehab. She stays sober for a bit but then eventually relapses. Each period of sobriety gets shorter and shorter, with the most recent time being just long enough for her to get home.

Now, fast forward to the current problem. For the last two weeks my mom has done nothing but slept. She hasn?t had a single thing to eat in two weeks, at this point i dont know how she is alive. She sleeps all day and all night. She gets up a few times during the day to smoke a cigarette and drink, then back to sleep. She has been extremely angry and I cant do anything around the house without her yelling because im making too much noise (even just refilling a water bottle). She refuses to go to the hospital to get help.

I guess im just wondering if anyone has gone through anything similar and if they can share some advice. Im scared for my mom and im afraid she has just given up. Im afraid she wont wake up every time she goes to sleep.",Alcoholism

I have heard consuming lots of fluids and electrolytes can also decrease damage to the renal system and the brain.

"32M here, been abusing alcohol significantly for the past 3-4 years at least.

I want to stop, but I basically feel like I won?t let myself. I?ve had shakes/nausea/sweating during days after excessive drinking before, which I think would indicate significant withdrawal, though I think I?m in a better place now. However, I keep telling myself that I do need to taper given my regular use, and at the same time I sabotage myself because as I continue to let myself drink, and I just want to feel the effects and I can?t effectively taper and stop.

"Last summer my uncle in law came to stay with us after his wife kicked him out and filed for divorce. She did it because he lost his job due to drinking and almost died from it. He told her he quit and she constantly found him drinking secretly. His first night with us he was wasted. We never said he had to be sober but said we would like him to try to be. He never drank in front of us but we could tell he was always drunk. We use to drink every single night and stopped before he came to us so there wasn't any temptation. A few months go by and he is still jobless, stays at the house everyday, all day but swears he is sober and constantly getting interviews. I had a REALLY bad week at work and warned him that I would be drinking but would hide in my room. Came home to a bottle of vodka and wine on the counter. Vodka for me, wine for the guys. Ok? The next day there was a bottle of whiskey and most the vodka gone. It quickly became normal for all of us to drink openly together. A couple of weeks later we tell him we are going back to not drinking and he should too after I saw him get a cup of just vodka at 6am. ""Tomato less bloody mary"" he told me. He didn't drink for 1 whole day and his body went into shock. He was throwing up hard all day and when he went to drive to the store he had a seizure and was hospitalized for a week. When he came out we said rehab or we kick him out. Amazingly he went to rehab for 5 weeks, came back and was a quiet/stoic man for a little while. Took his meds, went to his daily AA meetings and seemed to be doing well. Until recently. He's back to being obviously drunk again while bragging about how amazing he is at AA and how they made him a lead. We didn't have proof until we started to watch the camera in our living room (that he was aware of!). We saw him leave the house, come back with a brown bag and go straight to his room. Then came out with an empty bottle of vodka and took it out to the recycling. My husband went out there, grabbed the bottle and confronted him, leaving out the part where we saw him from the camera. He denied it and said he was cleaning and found it which was a lie. We said we weren't going to kick him out but he needed to get his shit together. Since then we have seen him do the same thing 4 more times. Bring a brown bag straight to his room, bring out a now wrapped up bottle and take it to his car instead. (We checked the recycling/garbage and it doesn't exist) We know he is still drinking and know he is being extra sneaky about it. Just don't know how to approach him about it. ""Hey we started watching you through the camera you know about and aren't dumb?"" Losing his job, wife, house and almost dying twice has not stopped him. Rehab, therapy, AA and us confronting him did nothing since he just lies about it. Do we just act like we don't know, continue on with our lives and pray his moves out soon?

"I'm living with my GF, and her adult son is staying with us. Sometime he throws fits, hits things, and swears and it's very distracting because I work from home. One day from about 10am and over the course of the day I had to tell him multiple times to knock it off, at increasing levels of urgency...meaning I went from asking to yelling to getting in his face to tell him to knock it the F off. Ultimately, at the final confrontation after 6pm, the extent was a lot of yelling all day, vomit mess, and a broken shower curtain and cabinets in the bathroom.

He claims he doesn't remember anything and that he's sorry. I find it hard to believe that such a long period of time can be erased from memory but I'm open to understanding it better. On the other hand, I find it very convenient nothing is remembered because of all of the chaos and nonsense that occurred all day.

"I (34m) have been struggling with alcohol since my first drink when I was 17, though I did not realize it for a long time, and even then I think I subconsciously always thought I could stop if I really wanted to. I have not been able to and I am at my breaking point as the shame and disappointment are overwhelming me.

I have been living with my girlfriend (35) and her two kids (6 year old boy and 13 year old girl) in a house I bought for us in her hometown for the last two and a half years. They have become my family in that period but I am throwing that all away due to my alcohol use and depression. I selfishly do not want to let them go, but at this point it is obvious to me that I am doing them all more harm than good.

My girlfriend already has enough on her plate and has to deal with multiple sclerosis on top of a shit father to her kids who moved out of state and offers no support. My goal has always been to try to improve the life of her and the kids, but now I am just making their life harder. I am not a violent person but was arrested for a domestic violence charge for pushing my girlfriend a year ago as alcohol turns me into a different person. The kids have not seen us get into a major fight but I was away from them for months due to this incident and was away another time for rehab, all of which has been very confusing and unhealthy for them, not to mention our teenager is very smart so she certainly knows there are some deeper issues.

The home that they live in (I have been staying there on and off recently and staying with my father as well while we've been trying to work things out) is in my name and I pay for it but I will not be able to continue to afford it if I move out, and I know she would struggle a great deal on her own to support herself and the kids financially without me so I have no clue what to do. I feel like I am being selfish and negativity impacting their lives if I stay and I feel like they will struggle a great deal if I leave, both financially and emotionally for the kids.

If anyone has any advice it would be greatly appreciated, both for the situation with my family and regarding staying sober. The first time I went to rehab it was an absolute disaster that made me not trust those facilities at all. I tore 3 ligaments in my knee playing basketball at the facility well before my stay was supposed to be up and was basically held hostage there and lied to while they scrambled to figure out how to protect themselves. Still get the 5 figure bill that they told me was covered in the mail all the time. I have also tried AA many times at different stages of my struggles but it has not been a good fit for me in the past.

Thank you if you have read this far and if you have any advice for me. I scroll through reddit from time to time but haven't posted much and am a generally very closed off person so this has been difficult for me. I am very much at the end of the rope so to speak and have been driving away the suicidal thoughts. I know that wouldn't help anyone and I do still have a sliver of hope that I will be able to find happiness within myself one day.",Alcoholism

"December was a goo/bad month for me, good because I drank everyday and it was fun, and bad because I had too many mornings where I couldn't remember the last three hours of the evening.

I'm trying to eat healthier so don't want lemonade as it is full of calories. I'm not really a beer drinker, but will give anything a try.

Advice on drinks will hopefully help with my 9 day holiday that starts tomorrow with my husband, and we will probably spend a lot of time in the pub.

At 14 I drank about 1/2 pint of Golden Grain and felt like I was in an opium den. This is where it all began for me. I drank like normal teenage males drank until I hit about 21 years old and hit the bar scene. I always worked and held a job, but the disease started flipping on me around age 40. I no longer controlled my drinking, it was controlling me now. And the amounts were going through the roof and death was near for me I could tell. Jan. 22 , 2008 was it for me. I made a decision I was an alcoholic and I could never drink again .On jan 23rd 2008 I started my journey. 5114 days later I don't feel like drinking. I don't want to go backwards. I don't want to suffer anymore. I battle through life sober now. Each year gets easier. If you have any questions or are struggling today please feel free to PM me.",Alcoholism
"I'm just curious if anyone has experienced anything like this, the first time I got sober I don't rember this happening, but then again that was a 4 day detox in the hospital.

Anyway I'm like 2.5 days sober and the last couple nights this strange thing has been happening. For one, this is like, probably stay up too long tired (but it's nice to feel that real tired behind the eyes feeling again, not drink till passout, if that makes sense) and I will be drifting off to sleep and just as I'm like transitioning into dream land the volume of the dream will suddenly spike super loud and jolt me awake. This will happen a few times in a row. It's sorta messing up sleep but I already knew sleep wasn't going to go back to normal in just a couple days and despite this I still feel more rested.",Alcoholism
"I definitely have a problem. the first time I had even one sip of alcohol, I knew it would fuck me up for the rest of my life. and here I am, 25 years old with a college degree working 40 hours a week at a gas station job that sucks my soul little by little each day. the only respite I have from how much I hate my life is by drinking. I used to go out and drink with friends, but now I just want to be alone and get plastered. I hate my life. I have attempted suicide twice while drunk and ended up in an inpatient mental health facility one of those times. being in there gave me a sense of clarity I had never had before but, as soon as I got out, I went back into the same old cycles. now shit is getting worse and worse. but I still cant imagine my life without drinking. I'm not ready to be sober but I absolutely hate this life and especially hate what it's done to my body. I'm constantly making excuses for myself to drink and I feel so out of control. I get drunk a few times a week and have sex with men that disgust me completely... I don't know what to do anymore. I can't stop but I'm scared to admit that I have a problem. both my parents are recovered alcoholics and I'm scared I will disappoint them if I admit I am struggling with this. sometimes I don't even know what's real and whats not. at this point, I feel stuck. I'm trying to move back in with my mom, but I'm paralyzed by fear and can't do anything to further this plan because I think im nervous to be in an environment where I won't be able to drink.... I need to change my life but I just don't feel strong enough.... any words of encouragement are welcome.",Alcoholism
"I moved into the city a few years ago after college. I now find myself getting blacked out every single weekend, sometimes during the week and just living in the same cycle unable to stop.

Weekends consist of going out with my friends, drinking enough to black out, doing a bag of cocaine, sometimes molly, and just always going home with a random person. I?ve even gotten to the point where i will just meet up with men on tinder and get drunk with them to have sex, and never speak to them again.

The problem is everyone in my profession is similar, all of my friends are similar and i just don?t even know where to begin. I?ve gotten to a few days being sober throughout the week but it just tends to happen during the weekend after i get a text from somebody to go out. After i go out i spend the whole next day or two in bed dying.

I work from home and so i just wake up a minute before i need to log in so I haven?t had any negative affects at work yet.

Just - how the F do i stop this? I?ve tried but a text from somebody just gets me right back into the cycle. I try going to the gym during the week and cleaning up so that keeps me distracted. But weekends are just completely different. What should i do?",Alcoholism
"My dad started drinking shortly after his knee injury 7 years ago. At that time I was pretty young so I really didn't think much of it. He wasn't able to walk for at least five months after it so I can only imagine what he was going through at the time while being bedridden.

At first, all he did was cry when he was drunk. It was so loud I'd usually leave or stay in my room with music playing to drown it out. But as the years went by, he only got worse.

Gradually he became more vocal, saying what was on his mind that he usually kept to himself when sober. Especially things about my stepmother or me that should be kept to himself. Even then I didn't realize the gravity of how wrong that was. Not until I got up to my senior year of high school. That's when he would shout and cuss at us. Not physically violent but enough to scare us. And I had such a hard time understanding why he was like this and why he would be harmful towards us.

Now a few years after the pandemic I can't imagine how much worse he can get. He drinks and drives, mentally and verbally abuse me (recently come to terms with this), and drinks almost every day.

I'd like to say that I still love him, but it's hard not to resent and hate him at the same time. I feel guilty admitting that but I'm not sure how else to express my feelings about it either.",Alcoholism
"Alcoholism runs in my family, I have been drinking almost daily for most of my adult life. Lately (the last year for sure) it?s gotten pretty bad as I switched to vodka water to cut calories? sounded like a good idea at first and it did help me shave off the 50 lbs I gained from drinking a bottle on wine/day a few years before. However I?ve been consuming a 40 every 2-3 days these last few months, knowing that I am harming myself because I get depressed. I drink when I?m sad, mad, bored, alone, or having fun. But it?s gotten to the point that I need it right after work even before I go grocery shopping.

This last week I have been feeling a lot different mentally and physically, work has become very challenging (I am a teacher hah) and so I need to get my shit together as I feel like I may have done damage to my body.

My real question(s) is what will happen if I don?t stop? Will stopping be enough? Is it ok to stop cold Turkey, am I going to be okay? I have to go to work tomorrow and I?m just feeling so lost on what to do besides just lay here. I didn?t drink yesterday so I am on day two.",Alcoholism
"I think I might have a problem. It all started last year when my nan died. We were particularly close. I'd see her almost everyday and I helped my mum care for her in the weeks before her death. I've always had bad mental health and depression but it was manageable before this. After she died I started having severe panic attacks. Ones that were so bad that I'd be calling an ambulance convinced I was dying. They got so out of control that that I quit my job, I stopped leaving the house, stopped meeting friends. I basically lost my life to the anxiety. The only thing that would stop the constant panic was having a drink. I'd have 2-3 glasses of gin and lemonade and the anxiety would just melt away. I began to use alcohol to be able to do normal things. If I needed to go to the local shop for bread, I'd have a drink first. If I was having a very anxious day, I'd have a drink. It wouldnt just be one drink either. I'd drink 3 quarters a bottle of gin. This has been going on for a year and I'm scared. I binge drink 3/4 times a week. Maybe even more. Its got the point that my mum is concerned. I get very defensive when she brings it up. I've done some really stupid stuff when I'm drinking. I have no control when drunk and totally self sabotage. I Slept with idiots who couldn't give a toss about me, put myself into dangerous positions, try to commit suicide. I don't know if I have a problem and I wouldn't know where to even look for help even if I did. I feel so alone and empty. I drank until 4am last night and now I feel full of shame and regret because my anxiety is back ten fold and I have no one. I just want someone to hug me and say it'll be okay.",Alcoholism
"I was sober for a week with no firm plan or do I stop completely or keep drinking over weekend.

I had a shitty Wed and by Fri I was mad as hell, so, I decided I won't drink much, although a guy I'm meeting each Fri brings rakija. So, he sat his ass as usual at 8 pm. I knew if I get drunk I would act like a maniac (because of so much of anger) plus I have no memory afterwards.

I was sipping myself tea for most part of evening but the guy just could not stop talking. He talked continuously since 8 pm to 4 am. Somewhere around 1 am I was taking small bits of rakija. Like a soup spoon every half an hour. With water and tea in between.",Alcoholism
"I?m not an alcoholic, but I enjoy a few cans of Heineken a night. I feel that when I drink, I snore more. Which isn?t unusual I know. I?m curious to know whether anyone suffered with bad snoring that went away when they stopped drinking?

I?m also aware that losing weight can help with snoring - so quitting alcohol can in turn help.",Alcoholism
"As of today I have a full week sober. If I had drank yesterday I would have probably started a fight with my boyfriend and had to get an Uber to stay somewhere else. Well, we woke up today and are having a great day. As it turns out, you CAN have fun sober. Lol. You just have to do something other than stewing at home!

I also have a job interview coming up on Wednesday. Things just feel good right now, after spending the last few months always waking up sick and hungover. Coming from someone who has zero drive most of the time, you can do it too I promise.",Alcoholism
"I?m 39 m and been an alcoholic since I was a teen. I finally got sober at age 35 but I?ve slipped real hard been on a bender for a couple months. I?m drinking 30 standard drinks a day and trying to detox myself, I can?t get into a detox or get benzos. Today was meant to be the day, but 6 am the shakes set in so bad my heart racing, I?m aware of the dangers of alcohol withdrawal I?m sipping warm beer just got 3 down after the first couple just came up again. Not sure why I?m posting this really, maybe to keep all you sober people sober. I?m in so much pain, blood in my vomit but I have no option but to try get these beers in to make me somewhat well.

"Every time I drink the last 3 toes of both my feet and my ankles burn and tingle, and now my ring fingers and pinkies have started doing the same. I can?t stop drinking. I?ve tried so many times, I have a therapist, I?ve gone to AA. I can clear so much booze it scares me now. I have almost died from drinking (not in my head like I had alcohol poisoning) and I don?t know what to do at this point.",Alcoholism
"Basically in order to unwind and help with my sleep i usually throw back two drinks every night. I?ll start off with Heineken throw back a sleeping pill and then have one drink, maybe another beer or glass of wine to round off. If i don?t do this i will probably not get my full nights rest. I don?t think I?m doing harm as i (think) I?m healthy, exercise daily and try to eat right and not overweight. I have issues with sleep so a beer and a sleeping pill can ensure i get a good nights rest without grogginess. My family on the other hand think I?m an alcoholic they don?t know about my sleeping pills all they see is that i drink every night. I am not worried about this but lately i feel they?re being too judgmental. What r ur thoughts?",Alcoholism
"I have made legitimate efforts to change the person I am. I am close to 90 days sober and I am so proud of myself. My brother who is 35 keeps going around and brining up stories of the person I was and how evil and awful I am. Literally telling new people who either come into the family or otherwise stores about me when I was 13-16. How I was evil, a brat, horrible, addict, terror. He makes these stories out like I did all these things just the day before. I haven't spoken to him in a very long time and I still hear from others how he is telling stories of me that either happened so long ago or absolutely aren't true. I am quite literally a different person today but nobody cares. My name still gets smeared across the board. Everyone I encounter who has met my brother first greets me with disdain and disgust.

But recently it feels like her disorganisation and her chaos is pulling me down, and tearing my own life downwards. I don't want that either.

She struggles with PTSD and insomnia, among other issues like self harm. I feel like I am making her seem bad, but she is beautiful, her soul is gorgeous, and she just needs to see that.

Sometimes now I end up drinking with her, because for normal people I guess a few nights drinking isn't so bad... but its starting to affect my wellbeing because my anxiety is high, and hangovers make that worse.",Alcoholism
"My brother has been an alcoholic for some time, and I am just looking for some help in dealing with the trauma and stress he is causing, particularly towards my parents who frequently have to take him to the ER.

It's been going on for a few number of years, probably going on 6. He has seen counselors and therapists, this afternoon he has ended up at another Hospital. He is 32 years of age, no one knows what to do. There are many people here who have admitted their problem to themselves and have turned the corner into being a healthy, functioning adult.

Whenever I suggest something, it doesn't seem to work, or he doesn't take his problem seriously enough to change.",Alcoholism
"I'm 18 years old and I began abusing alcohol at 16 (drinking alone, at school, before any social outing) Not in huge quantities, but still very damaging to my mental health. It's hard to talk about it since I'm so young, it's very embarassing.

It's hard for me to completely quit, since my family drinks alot. Also, at my age alcohol is involved in almost every social gathering and party. Legal age is 18 where I live but almost all teens start drinking before that. If I refuse a drink, I know people will be confused and ask questions. I don't want everyone to know about this. I also love partying.

Has anyone ever succeeded on just reducing the amount, or only drinking socially? Is it possoble or should I just stop? I doubt I'm able to completely cut it forever. Is it too late to go back to being a normal 18yo? I've also managed to drink only once since new year.",Alcoholism
"I threw out a year and a half sober. 6 months ago I went to Las Vegas for a wedding with every intent that I was going to go to AA meetings and stay sober but I ended up drinking... I have had a month or so sober since then but keep falling off the wagon. It is to the point where I have the shakes and feel like I will have seizures again if I stop... Every night I say its the last time and then in the morning I wake up sick and cannot handle the consequences of what I have been doing to myself. I just moved to a new town, two states away from where my home group was and it has been hard to go to new meetings with new people. Every time I go out again, It becomes even harder to come back.

"Alcoholics, friends and family of alcoholics, I have a serious question. If you've been sober for 6 months after doing a 60 day inpatient rehab and have 2 drinks but immediately own up to it and are honest, do you consider that a relapse and do you think you should immediately go back to a 45-60 day inpatient rehab? My best friend has had struggles but I don't know it warrants going back to inpatient treatment immediately and their AA sponsor didn't think it was an appropriate response either. They have an extremely manipulative SO who is emotionally abusive and gaslights to the nth degree and is all about punishment for past bad behavior. I question everything because of their past, but I also don't know how to walk the line of being supportive vs enabling.

The part that makes me really sad, was that, i was thinking about it and told myself in my mind, ""well, chefs always try the food they make, this is the same, i'm not drinking because i want it, i just need to know if i made it correctly"" i connected the keg, turned on the co2 and filled a glass. Four beer glasses after, and i can't stop feeling so, so weak, and broken, four months down the drain, and for what? Nothing.

"Delta 8 has been a miracle substance for me personally. I get a lot of the medicinal benefits of THC without an overwhelming high. To me, it feels similar to quality CBD but with a kick. Yes, I still get a buzz but it is much more mild than Delta 9 or illegal substances and that's why I like it. I can't get too high on it and I don't get the negative side effects I've typically experienced from consuming regular Delta 9 products. It's more functional.

I'm an alcoholic addict and have been since age 12. I'm almost 30 now. I've tried many different things including medications such as Naltrexone and Antabuse to reduce or quit drinking and nothing has been very successful.

I discovered Delta 8 in 2019. It has changed my life. I'm able to use it and get real medicinal effects with the buzz that I crave while still maintaining normal functioning. I still drink but not nearly as much.

I used to drink 2 fifths of vodka a day with beer as chasers. Now I usually have anywhere from 2 shots and 1 beer to 4 shots and 2 beers a night. To me that is an improvement and I'm not sure I could have reduced the amount this much without my use of Delta 8 and other cannabinoids.

This is just my story and personal experience and I'm not telling anyone they should replace one substance for another.",Alcoholism

I would like to try gradual alcohol reduction, so I don't have anxiety , spasms and cluster headaches.

Does anyone have resources on how to proceed?

Also if I reduce my alcohol consumption I sleep like 6hours a night and wake up with a very tense body and feel really weird and anxious. Any tipps?

I can't continue like that and benzos don't help long term. My next move would be becoming a buddhist monk (no joke). I just can't handle the suffering that comes with addiction.",Alcoholism

That said, has anyone wise dealt with alcohol abuse as a way to cope with the disconnected and disorientation of ADHD? If so, how did you address ADHD after stopping alcohol?

I suppose this isn't an articulate post - the concern I'm trying to address is knowing 1.) How much of my abuse was addiction related vs. Self medicated. 2.) Strategies to cope with ADHD without escape through vices. 3.) How did abstaining help (if at all) with ADHD symptoms?",Alcoholism

And, maybe more importantly, nobody knows how much I drink. I hide bottles of wine in the back of my dresser so my boyfriend doesn?t find out, and when I?m around him or anyone else I try to act as sober as possible. When I?m drinking socially I tend to drink a lot more than anyone else a lot faster than anyone else, but I never really act drunker than anyone else.

I drink sometimes to deal with stressful situations, ie a bad day at work or fight with a loved one. But most times it?s just because it?s fun. I like feeling buzzed, a LOT. My husband smokes weed and doesn?t really drink, and I?m really intrigued by vape pens because of the high but no smoke. He keeps saying I would really enjoy them and it would save my liver, but the problem is I can?t smoke because I could get randomly drug tested at my job. However, I could move to a different department, but it would be less pay and much more physically demanding. I really like my job now. I?m good at it and I love the challenges it brings. So I?m really torn. Anyone switch over to weed after drinking? Would love to hear how it went.

"Long story short I'm a 23 year old alcoholic. My girlfriend (we have only been dating for 2.5 months )has been 6 months sober & I tried to quit drinking because she's been inspiring me to do better. I work for a trucking company and we drive across states for deliveries. I consider myself a pretty positive person & these past 11 days I've been feeling much better... However today my coworker & I (on a long distance drive) got into an argument. I'm very high energy & I started the day a little bit too positive for his mood. I was trying crack jokes & stuff & he just wasn't in the mood. He told me I was annoying & it really hurt me because I thought I was just being friendly. Now I'm stuck with him for the next few days in this semi truck & we've only exchanged a few words since our argument.

We stop at a truck stop and I just needed to get something to drink. I bought two twisted teas & the total for my purchase was $6.66 (for 2 drinks)",Alcoholism
"I have been drinking a long time but the past a couple of days I went hard. I would get off work and just start drinking without any food in my system.

I did this last week and noticed on Saturday my liver felt weird?like the area where my liver resides. It felt swollen and kind of hurt when I?d laugh. I ignored it and drank again that night. The next morning it kind of hurt but didn?t feel swollen and my stomach hurt. It?s like I had the worst acid reflux ever and I was so bloated and felt like shit the whole day. Like I couldn?t eat anything and my heart was racing. No yellow eyes though so that was good right??

I poured out all the alcohol I had.

I kind of don?t want to drink anymore. That was scary and I?m worried I effed up my liver. I think I?m gonna take a break for a while for so my liver can have a break.",Alcoholism
"I think most of us say this everyday.

But I?m laying here all alone. I hit her up several times and no response, just left me on read.

I loved it and I love her.

I?ll always appreciate everyone here and hope for the best for you all.

No more drinking.",Alcoholism
"After a year of going to meetings and being able to limit, but not stop drinking...I decided to go ahead and try Naltrexone.

My doctor was excited to prescribe it as he said he had several patients find success.

The directions were to take one pill a day for the first week and drink as normal. I did that, even though it was tough some days because the pill made me nauseous. One problem I noticed is the last two days ""the buzz"" has come back when I drank enough.

Today I start my second week, where I double the dosage and try not to drink. I didn't get much instruction other than that. I looked up the sinclair method but you have to pay for that.

Anybody find success with this have any tips or warnings? I have a ""safety bottle"" in case I",Alcoholism
"Nine years ago, an event happened in my mom?s life that caused her to go down an alcoholic spiral.

I?ve lived at home for 8.5 years of it. There were many nights of coming home to screaming, fighting, and overall abusive drunken behaviour. Things would get thrown, banter would last hours, and it would be constant.

There were also many nights of coming home to see her passed out drunk on the floor. Those nights were more bearable.

All of this constant fighting, hatred, and fear developed over time. I would find myself jumping every time I heard a noise downstairs, thinking she stumbled, fell or stomped her feet. I would be scared to make a noise after coming home, in case she is passed out and I could avoid being around her for the night.

Now it?s at the point where I never know if she?s drunk. She?s been drunk working from home, when she drives, and in most conversations it?s like talking to a child, even when she?s sober.

I?m starting to realize these traits manifesting in myself and I don?t know what to do. I just want to get away from everything. I?m so tired.",Alcoholism
"I (26M) got so drunk last weekend I fell over and broke a rib. Not the first time I?ve injured myself drunk, but never like this. I proceeded to get up and dance half naked on stage, with a broken rib. I brushed it off for a few days but after the pain got worse I took myself to hospital.

I?m housebound for the foreseeable future and it?s quite miserable. I?m on a low dose of codeine (prescribed) for the pain so I literally can?t drink, but this has given me a moment to think about my actions and how alcohol is ruining a lot.

I want to get fit, lose weight, be healthier, study more, and focus on what?s really important. It?s been my goal to improve my life, and I?ve been trying, but that next drink has always taken priority. ?Just tonight? turns into the next day, then the day after, which leads to 5 or 6 days in a row. I?ve lost myself in the process. I?ve taken breaks from drinking before, and God I love not being hungover, but I think ?just tonight? should be a daily mantra I apply to being sober from now on - every day.

I?m not worried about telling my friends I?m stopping drinking, but most of our plans revolve around it. I can stop drinking alone, but my worry is that a night out with my friends will trigger a binge or me drinking alone again. I have bipolar type 2 and when I?m hypomanic I tend to binge too. It?s always a balance.

If you?ve been in a similar situation, how did you do it? Are you able to get into a place where you can safely drink?",Alcoholism
I am on day three of sobriety after binge drinking blackouts (posted my mini story a few days ago) to shame and going through the WD currently. Today there was a bottle of wine that was not trashed. I didn't hide that I wanted it and my husband tossed it. This is the first time in over almost two years that I said I will not drink today!,Alcoholism
"I've been a heavy drinker for the last 2.5 years. I started around 21 years old and basically started a habit where I drink way too much Vodka... every night. I went through my very heavy phase for the longest duration, probably for 1.5 years I was killing a 1.75 L in 3-4 nights along with beer. Then for the last year I've been trying my best to stick to a pint of vodka, but then along with too many beers.

I got covid a week and a half ago so I didn't drink for around 4 days and my withdrawals were worse then ever. Mostly heavy sweating, heavy shakes, and thats mostly been it but then for the last two nights I've had Hypnogogic Hallucinations... all night. It's not as bad as what I've read others have experienced, but im still terrified cause it seems like what could come after Hallucinations could be Seizures.

I fully plan on weining myself off now that I have a head start on the shittieness. I just wanted to see if there's anyone who has been in my shoes, and how you went about weining yourself off. I really, really don't want to go in to detox although I know it's the safest. But would really like to hear what your guys experience was and maybe a good scale to go off of for the weining process.",Alcoholism
"I'm definitely a functional alcoholic. I have a great job and can keep shit together to act like a normal human being.

But I drink a lot. My go to at a liquor store after work is a couple shooters of vodka and at least 4 beers. This is on a light day.

I just had a really stressfull week at work so my boss gave me friday off. I don't have a girlfriend or anybody that lives with me so I have no judgement whenever i become a fuggin degenerate.

Consecutive Days off for me these days are just ""well lets drink 1st thing in AM....you'll get drunk quickly....pass out....wake up....drink some more....pass out again."" That has been my M.O. for a bit now. I think it gets worse in the winter since there is nothing else to do anyways.

Well, I woke up today after this pattern and of course I went ahead and grabbed me a beer. Chugged it and felt uneasy right after I did it. I never puke up alcohol but this was a rare time I actually did. I puked it up and then at the very end I puked up blood.

It was definitely an ""oh shit"" moment for me. I thought it might have been a fluke and just a one time thing but when i was brushing my teeth I went ahead and forced myself to puke and yep of course some coagulated blood came out.

Fuck. Theres part of me that really is scared and I think the alcohol numbs the other BS as well. Does this just seem like a stomach ulcer? I have no pain in stomach but i might be just numbing it completely out. IDK.",Alcoholism
"I'd much rather spend that money on the booze. It's so expensive nowadays (at least in my country), that it makes me pissed that sometimes I'd rather to spend it on something I actually enjoy. I mean, enjoy way more than eating.",Alcoholism
"So I talked to my husband when he woke up. He didn't remember anything but as I walked him through the events as I experienced them, he came to the same realization that I did. He knew he messed up and called our HMO about getting treatment that same day.

The doctor prescribed naltrexone and counseling. My husband says that with the pills after he has three drinks, he doesn't feel like drinking anymore. He can go the week without drinking, then isn't feeling the need to binge on the weekends.

It's still early but what I'm seeing so far is promising.",Alcoholism
"Basically my coworkers and I went to a going away party for someone who worked there. Everyone had a drink, not me. I drank diet coke and had to listen to their silliness and genuine happiness as I stared at my sobriety app under the table, counting the minutes. Four months and ten days.

Managed to maintain my fun loving personality and I got home okay, but damn do I have a headache.",Alcoholism
"Honestly it feels fucking impossible to escape alcohol references, whatever it is. Ads, friends and family drinking that of which I have zero control over because I currently live with. The only friends I have (those of which I have moved away from as to escape a city full of narcotics for my own good) all drink. Everywhere I look I see or hear alcohol it's nauseating.

What can I do to make this easier? I feel like I've tried everything.",Alcoholism
"I know I've pushed the limits for a while now. I don't have hangovers like we all complained about when we were young! I'm a spry 36-year-old that people always say looks much younger. (I guess good genes and I didn't smoke?) No idea, because I've destroyed my body the last 15 years. Nonetheless, I've become increasingly concerned as of the last few years. I attended an uncle's funeral and found out many skeletons of many people's closets and it pushed me to the limit. Has anyone felt so bad after pushing the limits for a few days that they then become red all over their body and out of breath for a couple days? Can't really walk right, shaking for a few days while still intaking like 10ish/night, horrific headache etc. for like a week straight? I mean I got the hot/cold sweats and tossing and turning, but I wasn't quitting. I was still at 10+/ night. Heart beating super fast might be the worst part. Honestly, it's not like it's the first time it's happened, but going through withdraws when I still was taking 10+ just so they didn't get worse. I realize it's not healthy. It's probably happened like 20 times over the last couple of years. I also work with doctors, so I feel like they all know, and I'm performing a circus act walking a tightrope. This last time was the worst.

I do know inflammation is no joke, it's linked to like 120 diseases, (the worst being cancer, diabetes, heart disease), and alcohol causes inflammation, so it's only an amount of time. I just wonder what all those symptoms mean. The kidney alone can cause pain basically anywhere. Are all my organs are mad? My body is slowly dying? Both? I also just stopped using birth control. But shooting pains everywhere mixed with feeling like I can't catch my breath is scary when I'm a normal weight for my height. I think I reach an alcohol induced level of amenia. I'm just scared of all of the pains. I mean, for the last 7 or 8 years I've been averaging about 15 to 20 shots a night, (I've got single digits for certain months spread throughout).

I mean, I guess I know the answers. . . I just need someone to talk to. I honestly think it's more than just an addiction. I think I'm unhappy, and it's not about myself. It's a general apathy about the world even though I'm the kindest soul to everyone. The world is a piece of shit and I realize I'm a tiny piece of sand in the ocean. So, I drink to ease the day when everything horrible is happening that everyone chooses to ignore and nothing is done about? Yes, I'm equating my drinking with the world's problems. Could I be much more attractive if I really tried? Yes. I have friends that, that's all they do and people think they're amazing for just being pretty. I guess that's all they care about. Could I have finished my masters? Yes. But, I looked into my career path and it's not necessarily going to help with pay or competition. Could I have succeeded further though? Most definitely. I know I squandered opportunities and left some soot on some bridges. I'm upset about that. Could I save my relationship? Yes. I might be able to. Can I save my body? No idea. I feel like it's probably bad news bears. I think my outside looks a million miles better than what's hiding on the inside, and I can feel it physically.",Alcoholism
"I was seeing this guy, let's call him L (25M) who was a recovering alchololic. I didn't know at first how serious it was and he was 6 months sober, but he said he was never doing that well before and it felt different than any other time he tried. He was actively doing everything right, in therapy, built himself a structure to stay sober. I thought it was okay. We became very intense but were open and honest and happy, very emotionally available and healthy at setting boundaries. He did tell me a month in that his alchololism was much worse than I had imagined before and then i started to wonder if he should even be dating since he didn't have a year. we had a serious conversation about it, talked to both our therapists, but since we seemed to be doing well, and he wasn't drinking and didn't think he would, we decided to take me going home for christmas as a tester. I thought we were doing well over the break in seeing eachother, and we were for a bit. But he apparently almost relapsed. He didn't leave his room for four days, two weeks after being apart. He didn't eat for 6 days, he lost a stone (14lbs), he had to stop himself from drinking by taking 2 hour showers, he told me he hurt himself which he never did, all to stop him from drinking. He said that he had built a structure to keep in going, but it wasn't strudy enough to handle the wobble of a new relationship. He was apparently doing well on the high of us being together, we were so happy and doing so well, but when I left he didn't pick himself back together or return to his coping mechanisms. We had to break up which is heartbreaking, we both feel so strongly about eachother. I normally don't feel like connections are even real but this seemed so rare. He wants us to try being friends but I don't know if I can do that for him with out it being complicated which would further jeapordise his recovery. I care about him so much and want to be there for him (there were other things contributing to his downward spiral, not just me) but I don't know how. Right now we are in limbo, going to talk again.

I just want advice, or words of encouragement. I just want to know what I need to do so he'll be okay - I'm heartbroken we can't be together and the timings off, and so is he, but I don't want him to jeaoprodise his health and recovery. I don't know how to be there for him without being a problem. It also makes me doubt if his feelings for me were genuine and could have been healthy and good at another time, or if they were just a type of high? He says he won't try dating at all after this (we were just supposed to be a causual hook up, he didn't intend for this to happen but then, we clicked) because this is one in a million to him, which makes it even harder because I think he's right. I guess I'm just sad and scared for him. I wanted to be able to be with him through any of his struggled, even if he did relapse I wanted to be able to support his recovery, but I didn't realise how much I was putting it in danger. If anyone has advice or words of wisdom, that would be so appreciated. I'm kind of at a loss, I want to see him in any way but I need to and will do what's best for him and his recovery.",Alcoholism
"I am 24 years old and I've just starting officially going out with a guy who is 28 years old. I'm a small woman who doesn't really drink so when we first went out and he drank 15-20 pints of beer in one night I was taken aback, but I didn't think too much about it because people sometimes do like to let themselves go as people like to say. However, every time we have gone out to different pubs he is always drinking at least 4 pints to my 1 pint. He works in a building society and earns a very good wage, but after he's finished work he goes to his local for a few beers and then he'll ring me (without sounding drunk at all, but I know he has a few beers because my friend works at the pub) and we'll go and watch a fillm at a cinema and then back to the local for a few beers and then I'll stay at his place (he has a 4-bedroom house and he has already let me have one of the rooms to myself). He never gets a hangover. He's up at 5am and gets himself sorted and then leaves to go to work.

I've stayed at his for a few days and every day he drank 3-4 litres of cider, about 8 cans of beer and some whisky or a couple of bottles of wine.

On a Friday he finishes early and I meet him in town and we go for something to eat and then we'll go to restuarants and pubs and then get a takeaway and go home. On the weekend he'll cook us something to eat, but he drinks a couple of bottles of wine by 3pm and then we'll go out.

He went to college and then university. He reads lots of books. He's a very educated man. He's also a very quiet man who never causes any trouble.

From what he has told me, his ex-girlfriend wasn't very nice to him and it hit him hard.

I get on very well with his mother and I work part-time so sometimes I meet up with her during the week and we go shopping or for a bite to eat.

I mentioned my concerns to my mother and she told me that I shouldn't worry as long as he treats me right and avoids drugs (her best friend died of a drug overdose). My father also used to go to the pub in the evenings and it never was a problem for my mother.

Should I mention anything to my new boyfriend?",Alcoholism
"Oh great. I've just got to this charming point in the proceedings where drinking actually makes you feel BETTER. I remember this, from last time. About 8 hours after I last drank (so basically your standard work day), I start to feel sick, and get the hiccups. If I persist, I start to feel like I'm going to vomit. If I still persist in my foolish foray into sobriety, I start vomiting. If that's not enough to push me back into a bottle, I then start vomiting blood. The tremors really kick in about then, along with the hallucinations, fever, hiccups and more vomiting blood. If I drink, though ... About 7 straight shots in short succession in, and my symptoms just go away. All I feel is pleasantly buzzed. I know I'm dying. Again. I know the symptoms, from the white shits to the seizures. It's been 7 years since I had to do this. I lived to see 30, my life improved. But now, here we are again, the only thing thing that makes me start to feel better is the one thing poisoning me. I think I'll go in for drug and alcohol counseling this time. Maybe there's help to be had there. This time though, I have good people in my life, who care if I live or die.

I thought once I saw that I am actually damaging my body I?d feel more hardcore about quitting but I don?t and I?m super scared? I have sober days now. Like today. Then I fall off again and drinking during the middle of the day just to feel something. Why can?t I quit? :( It?s ruining my life and my body.

My actions have become progressively more regrettable as I become toxic to everyone unfortunate enough to care about me. I feel genuine remorse for the unpleasantness I inflict on others, but that isn't enough to stop me cracking open another can, and repeating the same behaviours. Gradually I've started to set lower and lower standards for my pathetic self, and I still fail to meet them every single time.

"I?ve been an alcoholic since I was about 20 years old. I am one month away from turning 28 and I have drank alcohol pretty much every day since I turned 20. I tend to go up and down in my consumption sometimes I?m cool with just drinking a 3-4 and calling it a night. Other times I?m drinking 8-12. I?m currently in like a 7-8 a night pattern which is like just a normal day for me.

I can?t really seem to cut down or stop, my fear of boredom sets in and I drink. I never usually drink during the day because I work except on some occasions where I?ve had some to get rid of my hangover. I don?t really exercise as much as I used to I used to be very active and eat healthy along with drinking every day to try to counter act it.

It's not fair to my parents and my sister's family. They don't deserve to explain to their kids how their uncle died at 39 from alcoholism.

"Haven?t bought any alcohol for home consumption in several months. A bottle of whiskey I have still has whiskey in it.

Had 5 beers while out with friends 5 weeks ago, felt rotten about drinking too much.

Had 1 beer while out with a friend 2 weeks ago, felt great about not overdoing it!

Last weekend, took 3 shots of whiskey over 2 days, at home alone. Although you all will probably say that was a foolish decision, I am proud that I didn?t go overboard with it, as I have done countless times before

In my free time, I have been engaged with a new hobby, and have just not really felt like getting fucked up. Not sure how long my new hobby will be fascinating to me, but in the meantime I have had a couple of months reprieve from the bottle, and I?m actually feeling ok",Alcoholism
"I don?t know what?s going on with me. I drank almost every day, at least a 12 pack, but more commonly an 18 pack and whiskey. There were some times it was pretty bad.

I?ve been doing that for about a decade. I think a lot of my problem was wanting a cigarette and not liking smoking unless I was drinking, and I didn?t like drinking unless I was smoking, so they drove me to one another.

Anyway, over Christmas it dumped a foot of snow and was too cold outside to smoke so I cut back. I bought a vape and was able to just sit inside, and it didn?t give me the drinking urge I normally had.

Anyway, it?s been two weeks and I?ve maybe had five or six beers. If I wanted to I could just stop completely, I haven?t had a drink in a few days.",Alcoholism

I?m not depressed although I do suffer from anxiety but I?ve learned to basically control in over the years. Every now and the if it?s bad enough I will take a Xanax to ease my mind but I don?t take them regularly at all maybe once or twice a year. I?m just confused because everyone you see that has alcoholism is usually unhappy and what not but I?m not unhappy. I know it?s a problem though and if I don?t nip it in the bud it will be very bad. My mother and father are both alcoholics but my dad thank god has recovered and is a very strong minded person.

"Is managing drinking possible when you have a problem? I?ve been drinking everyday for the past couple years. I don?t drink hard liquor, and my drinking hasn?t really impacted my life much. I usually drink 8-10 beers a night, and feel like shit when I go a night without it.
I am only 20 years old and really don?t want to have to quit all together but I?ve noticed a dependancy, despite being a pretty good drunk for the most part, (not a big partier, and don?t do anything to crazy), I have a history of alcoholism in my family and don?t want to go down that path.

"Hi, I'm hoping for some insight/advice. I'm (32f) currently separated from my partner (45m) of 13 years while I try to figure out whether I want to keep trying.

My partner is a regular heavy drinker. He drinks to the point of being wasted every Friday and Saturday night. Also uses cocaine every weekend (small ish amounts but very consistently every weekend). In the process of us becoming separated, I've brought up the issue of his substance use. My dad died when I was a child from an IV cocaine overdose, my mom was an addict, I have somehow narrowly avoided the same path. The cocaine is not the topic of my question but wanted to give context as to why I'm not ok with being around it.

When I brought up the fact I'm not ok with the cocaine, he said he understood but ""you know I'm not going to stop drinking"". He feels that getting wasted every Friday and Saturday night is not an issue, he can't possibly be an alcoholic, because he doesn't drink every day. He has long standing depression, anxiety, and a lack of self worth. I told him that I wished he didn't feel the need to get so wasted every weekend. That if he found a way to be comfortable with himself, perhaps by engaging with therapy, that he might no longer want to.

But it seems like he's not interested, and not willing to do this work. I'm at the stage where I'm thinking I want to start a family (I know .. after 13 years together... we've both avoided thinking too hard about our future together). I just can't have a kid with someone who insists on getting blackout drunk and doing blow every weekend night. And those evenings when he's drunk are the only times when he's open with me about his depression and self loathing. Another huge issue is that he doesn't remember these conversations the next day.

So... I guess my question is, am I crazy for viewing this drinking as an issue?? Am I crazy for asking him to consider therapy?? There's a lot of love there still... I see glimpses of the man he is outside of the depression and self identity issues and this is why I didn't run years ago.",Alcoholism

" I joined this group hoping to add something to it. My boyfriend of 8 years and father to our 6-year-old passed away in 2020 after being a high-functioning alcoholic for 20+ years. He was 44. His body just gave up....kidney failure, pneumonia, tracheotomy, coma....and it's all because of alcohol. My daughter is still processing everything. My heart breaks for her. I am slowly realizing the emotional abuse I suffered.....and working through it. Something I need to highlight here, though is that I am so thankful he is no longer suffering and dealing with YEARS of pain due to childhood trauma and ptsd after being in the army. Towards the end of his life, the alcoholism was in the forefront but now that he is gone I've learned so much about the disease and the reasons people suffer it. Alcoholics: I feel for you. Please get help...and SOON. Deal with your pain sooner than later, please. I know this is NOT EASY. Just believe in how crucial it is. You deserve BETTER.",Alcoholism
"(28m) I Feel infinitely better physically, focused on my health, eating right and exercising . Mental not so great, I?m in therapy regularly, have a good job, a good relationship, stability and hobbies but something really sucks and feels off 90% of the time, I?m always angry and almost act without thinking more now the I did when drinking like I?m almost getting off on my bad decisions, ( which are definitely waaaaayyy waaaaayyyyy less detrimental) but I?m bored and anxious, and I feel like an asshole in any social situations because I can?t function and just want to leave. My social skills are basically non existent. And the self loathing and hatred for myself continues to grow everyday. But here?s the catch I have no urge or want to drink. I?m just stuck in this god awful sober purgatory. I have friends (that drink) and I have sober friends( who I work out with and get coffee with ) but nothing goes beyond that. I have no life, and spend my time on this fucking hamster wheel of work,girlfriend,workout,hobbies. The repetition and stagnant boring stability is all I ever wanted when I was drunk and struggling to get sober and now I have it and I fucking despise it. I just get pissed off for no reason , I feel like I?ve lost my sense of purpose and happiness. I?m Grateful I?m sober but fuck man is this it? Anyone else struggle with the same things? I don?t work AA anymore, and have done meditation,journaling, and other recovery programs throughout my sobriety (inconsistently) but none of them really stuck and I just feel like an anxious empty asshole who?s sober.

"Some of you may remember a month or 2 ago I posted on here. That in itself was a big thing for me. I had a couple of great, helpful messages and I set myself a goal. The goal was to get through the stressful Christmas period in work, and then, make an effort to stop drinking, as I was pretty close to being hospitalised with the amount of blood I was throwing up, and crippling pains in my chest.

I just want to say thank you to those who took the time to message me with advice and encouragement.

I am 12 days sober today. Longest I have been in about 15 years. I remember Day 8 was the hardest for me after a really stressful day with some other personal bad news, but I got through it and I'm feeling great. Some nights I find it hard to sleep, but in general, it's not as bad as I thought.

"I was listening to a podcast in which the host was talking about her alcoholic father. She was talking about how painful it was to see her father get so far into his alcoholism that it was restructuring who he was. To my knowledge, he was an alcoholic all her life. Now, in her late 30s, he was the opposite person. As a kid, he taught her about being mannerly and how impactful kindness is. Later, when she visited him after needing to be hospitalized, he was unrecognizable and astonishingly rude to the nurses. She felt unwilling to see him for over a year as a result.

It just made me feel worse hearing this.

I know someone struggling with alcohol too, and it's in their family history. I know they consider empathy one of their biggest assets (that would be so crushing for it to fade). They do want to get better too. They are open to therapy as well. The issue is affording therapy...I even offered to pay. Other issues: empathy and social anxiety drive drinking & fear demotivates sobering up. Also, don't you need to stably replace alcohol with something? I just wanna know what else I can do. I'm open to anything. I won't regret my time spent on this.

My main drinking habit would be to have 3 or 4 large bottles of 6.8% cider to end the night on, then eventually crash to sleep. I?m not even sure how I allowed this to become a nightly habit in my life, but here we are. I?ve gone from a guy in a school not too many years ago, beaming with confidence, always complimented on my looks, skinny/lean, and had the whole world ahead of me.

europlasticity is a process of modifying or changing the neural system. Neural pathways are the root or we can say the reason for our habits and URGE to drink in cases of people like us who are addicted to alcohol. So if we can modify these pathways which actually begins the Day we were born then we can control our urge without any giving up and being demoralised every time coz we couldn't control our urge.

"Sometimes alcohol is the only thing that numbs it all
It?s no secret that I?m an alcoholic. From my friends to my doctors, etc. Then tonight it just hit me all over again. I?ve been stressed since the moment I could process memories as a child. From trauma, to being disowned for being LGBT, being homeless, mental health and hospitalizations, etc. A family history of alcohol the that and the lifelong trauma just hits it all. Sometimes just drink it clears me for a bit and makes me feel like none of that never happened and I?m just?here for once. But then it gets worse

I?ve lived with my roommate for a year and he knows my history and I struggle sometimes. But I?ve never let him see me get this bad. The other night I went to my local bar for a while and kept drinking. Later when I got home I was still drinking. Ir got to the point I was breaking down and CHUGGING beers. My roommate found me slumped over the sink and I broke down in tears for a bit. The alcohol was taking more than ever and I just fell onto the ground barely able to hold myself up and just broke down in a puddle of tears and a drunken mess. Thankfully, he sat there and listened to me and comforted me?which I really appreciate it

I?m in therapy. I do coping mechanisms, I?m on medication, I?m doing better than I have in years. But alcohol is always around. Collapsed on the floor in a drunken crying mess?is just another memory sitting in my head. I?m thankful to know he wasn?t judgmental but my drinking surrounding my head and ability to ?cope.?

I've been an alcoholic on off since I was 11 (I'm 23 now). I go through long spurts of being fine and then always seem to spiral. I've been drinking everyday since January 2021. I would consider myself a functioning alcoholic until late night hits. Lately I've been having the worst realistic nightmares ever & breaking out in itchy hives. These nightmares are so real and almost always have to do with my child be harmed in my house. I don't think I've actually slept in 3 weeks.

"I'm the type of person that's always gotta ""break the rules"" or sneak alcohol into any happy/festive situation I'm in. Gatherings/hangouts etc. Going to the fair/carnival? Sneak in a little vodka and a joint. Going for a hike? Bring a bottle of wine for the summit. Going for a walk or a bike ride through the city with friends? Definitely pack some liquor to spice things up.
I see examples in friends, movies, gaming etc. with groups of sober people having a bitchin' time, and I get jealous of their ability to have a truly great time sober, and just can't conceive of how to truly have a good enjoyable time without ""breaking the rules"" and spicing things up and getting a good buzz going.
My main problem is that I just don't enjoy most other people's company unless I'm buzzed. Guess I'm a bit old and jaded, but people/humanity just fucking bore me these days. Not saying I'm any better, but when I'm sober I feel like I've seen it all.

He seems fine now fully compismentice just pale with bags under his eyes does anyone know what caused this he was also taking a heavy dose of amitriptyline the last couple nights and came off them abruptly that could be what it is not sure and of course im worrying because he refuses to let an ambulance come or get help.",Alcoholism

Am I an alcoholic? I assume yes, but at the same time the only negative impact so far is financial (cost of booze) and in my own head as far as a guilty conscience in thinking I should drink less.

So we tried many things to try to curb her drinking, all the way from AA to Naltrexone and anything in between (I think), but nothing worked! wtf? it's like she's immune to certain meds, including the Naltrexone! and we had so many expectations!

She has a Dr. who gave her the Naltrexone in combination with another med that I can't remember the Nal, (and she says she ""wants to stop drinking"", whatever that means).

So my question is, have any of you guys experienced the Nal not working at all? is there a plan B when that happens?

"My brother called me last night in a fit of terrible withdrawals and came out about the drinking problem that he has had for the last 2-3 years. This is also verified by another sibling who used to live with him, but kicked him out because he wouldn't get help. Now he lives alone. He will guzzle alcohol until he passes out(cheap vodka), wake up and get more, and drink continuously for about 3 days. He was calling out of work sick due to withdrawal and lost 2 jobs before this one. He is lucky they're keeping him right now, they're understaffed and need the help.

When he's not drinking, he keeps up appearances very well. He often talks about job promotions or traveling or new cars, but also having money problems. Last night talking about his drinking, he's concerned he might be bipolar, and will go 3 days without sleeping which he says is his biggest motivation for drinking, he's also a veteran. (Can't sleep, so drinks so he finally can. Have family alcoholics who encouraged this habit.)

He almost had the police called on him for not looking after his son. He had ex-girlfriends watch him on the days he was suppose to because he was drunk.

These past two months had become a nightmare. All I could think about was purchasing, planning and hiding my next drink. What?s more I felt like hell, physically and emotionally. Throwing up, stomach pains, foggy head, exhausted, my skin is wrecked and my hair had begun falling out. I found myself thinking I?d be better off dead.

I was hospitalized before thanksgiving for heart palpitations. Turns out my potassium had fallen extremely low (guess why?) I was released without being honest with my doctors. I?m sure they knew what had caused it. I got my metabolic panel back and just like anyone could have guessed? I had all the obvious indicators of alcoholism. But I still hit the bottle with the excuse ?after Christmas I?ll deal with this?.

I put on a brave face, but I was miserable the whole holiday. But there was always one little glimmer still left in me, that would say ?this isn?t it, there?s something else for you?. Thursday I was driving and seriously contemplated driving off the side of the road.

I wrote my husband a letter, I was still too ashamed of my addiction to say it out loud or to his face. And basically said I?ve been drowning in a dark place and I?m lost. Told him about the car incident and that it had scared the hell out of me. Told him I couldn?t be a good wife or mother until I got help.

Dumped all my booze and Went to the ER. Sat in the car for 30 minutes asking myself if I could really do this, and I did. I was completely honest and started medical detox. The staff, who I was scared would be judgmental, have been lovely and supportive. And so has my family.

Currently on Librium and Adivan along with fluids and plenty of vitamins. After detox I?ll be entering an intensive outpatient rehab program. I know it?s going to be one of the hardest things I do, but I?m so ready to be unburdened. Alcohol has felt like weights around my neck.

Plus I've gotten fat, and I don't like that. After reducing the amount I drink per day over the past couple of months, alcohol just made me nauseous and gave me headaches anyway. I wonder if this is withdrawal or just sleep deprivation or a winning combination of the two. I don't crave alcohol at all, which seems weird if I'm going through withdrawal.",Alcoholism
"I always hated myself for being a loser kid with no social skills. I started going to bars and parties but basically I have no confidence unless I am really drunk.

"I've been having these very odd experiences. Randomly it's like my brain just stops working and goes blank for a few seconds. I'm still lucid but I lose all coordination. It usually happens when I'm sitting here playing video games and I just lose all form of coordination and can't even make a character walk correctly. It happened once when I was driving but luckily I was on a straight, empty road and I didn't wreck. However last night I was going down my building's stairs and it happened. I froze and then foolishly tried to take a step. My foot barely clipped the next step and I went down hard. My back is in so much pain right now. This is potentially very dangerous. I'm really poor but I'm willing to see a doctor over this if y'all agree that it's serious enough.

I'm tapering off today and going sober until it either stops or I figure out what it is.",Alcoholism
"I finally realized that I fell off the wagon and have gone back to some really bad habits. I'm not sure I can get back to the place I was before. It's really only been the last two months but I've been sliding and correcting for at least six. I really liked how I felt before but I don't really remember how I got to that place of peace and I'm not sure I know how to replicate it. I think I might have been deluding myself because lockdown really helped. It really narrowed my interaction with my environment and the people I had to deal with. That's gone and now the old stuff is back and it's really dragging me down. I can see it but I don't know how to fix it. I really don't want to re-experience the precipitating event that changed my attitude either, and I can't change my environment or the people I interact with right now. Do I hope for a better time or am I wasting my time?",Alcoholism

Thing is that when they looked at my liver values I was denied medicine since they were way too high.

I don't think I have a physical addiction since I've been sober since November without any physical withrawal symptoms.

My problem has always been that when I drink alone, I don't stop. 3L/1 big bag-in-box is not unusual for a single evening and then one more the next day etc. And it has come to effect work and relationships in the past. Plus I act like an asshole.",Alcoholism
"So I've never naturally been ""student of the year"". With that being stated I find recently that I have been having more difficulty forming complete verbal thoughts without mixing up the words or even slurring a bit when I've have had zero to drink that day. I am a regular drinker: for instance I had about 2 weeks off for the Christmas holidays and averaged about 5 drinks a night (sometimes 9 sometimes 3). I have been drinking less recently as I was a bad binge drinker for a couple decades on the weekend and a terrible binge drinker 2-3 nights a week for a couple years before moving in July.

"I'm not really good at admitting things like this but I feel like it's a problem I need to address and get off my chest. I'm 24 years old, soon to be 25 and I feel I am drinking way too much. I started really drinking when I was probably 19 after going through an experience where I was given herpes and I was a total wreak and felt so lost and wanted to give up in life. I started to pick up drinking as a way to feel the hole for some odd reason. I would start light like a six pack or two tall boys with 8% but I started to not be content with that. I would increase to higher packs or more tall boys or a bottle of liquor. Now a days I'm drinking a lot more like 3 or 4 tallboys a day and I'm becoming really concerned with where it's going. I hate that I feel like I'm losing control of my life. I know I used it as a crutch for a hard time in my life but I'm feeling so trapped by this. I'm in tears as I'm typing this. I guess putting in words and seeing it on screen is just a little eye opening. If you know of good ways to try and curb drinking I would love to hear how you have managed to stop or slow down.

"I was having a one-on-one @home evening date with my girlfriend. We made dinner/few drinks (for me one beer only, her many), then had sex, then decided to watch a movie together. Be close physically I thought. First time in a long time for us. She has been sick for weeks (always sick! Ugh). Towards the end of the movie she gets a text from a 2nd tier friend that wants to do facetime shots (happens all the time from this alcoholic friend). She leaves to pour alcohol and have her extra drinks and talk for a bit. WTF? I figured date night is over and I just head to bed upset. 15 minutes later she returns ?why are you mad, this only takes a minute?? I was certainly being passive-aggressive in my ?go to bed? response, but I explained I thought it was rude to take a call about alcohol from a ?I?d never trust anything personal? type friend and disregard me completely after weeks of no intimacy. I tried to explain that I value and wanted uninterrupted quality time (but would make certainly make exceptions for her kids or emergencies! But Not this !) She thought I was being ridiculous and controlling because it was a silly stupid fun shot but no big deal. She was pissed that I was pissed. I was being petty for a minor thing.

It?s like any thought of alcohol (with her alcoholic friends) and other sober people around will go invisible. We are not fun or relaxed. Or Easy going. Just judgmental.

She?s Protecting herself.

She thought I should?ve been easy going. I ruined the night by making a mountain out of a mole hill. I?m the inconsistent one ruining the evening, not her.

She?s Projecting.

I?ll always be secondary to alcohol, right? No chance for true dedication to us from her, right? No vulnerability, right? No real intimacy, right? Sober people don?t matter, right?

It?ll all never happen as long as alcohol controls her, right?",Alcoholism
"22F. Hi. I wanted to know if any of you had ever experienced with delirium tremens or at least strong alcoholic hallucinosis. What was your experience like and did you go to the hospital.

I wanted to share my story and have your opinion on it. Sorry if it's a little long. I'm just so traumatized.

I have been abusing alcohol for at least 2 years now with a 4/5 bottles every week. Two weeks ago I went absolutely nuts (I suffer from anxiety and alcohol was the only thing that helped me) and in the span of 5 days I drank 7 liters of vodka. I didn't sleep or eat anything during those 5 days. I also wanted to end it all so I did some stupid shit and took 5 painkillers. Then I stopped suddenly. My mom sent me to the hospital but I managed to escape. Got home. My hands were going crazy. I could not recognize anyone around me. I asked my mom her name multiple times. Which city we lived in. Stuff like that. Then I was rushed to the hospital again. They thought I was just being drunk and annoying so they locked me in a room for a few hours until my mom came to pick me up.

I got home, fell asleep for maybe 15 minutes, and when I woke up I was experiencing delirium tremens symptoms. I had the most terrifying auditory and visual hallucinations. I heard voices criticizing me, telling me my life is over. I was seeing things move in the room. I also felt like someone was touching my leg. It is truly the most terrifying thing someone could ever experience. You really think you are going insane. I heard the same song replaying in my head over and over again. When I clicked on a YouTube video, instead of the sound of the video, it was flashbacks of my mom's voice screaming at me, and when I paused the video it stopped, when I clicked again it continued. It was so precise. I went outside and the sounds of cars driving by were my mom's voice screaming at me.

Anyways I was about to literally die so I called the ambulance. I was rushed to the hospital and I explained all my symptoms. I thought they would help me. Instead, they locked me in a room with nothing but a bed and a straitjacket, which thankfully they did not put on me. They gave me nothing but a tiny glass of water. No medication. NOTHING. Now imagine you are already going insane, have been sleep-deprived for 5 days, stopped alcohol suddenly, you are hearing voices and you are being forcefully locked in a room with nothing but your thoughts. It was the most terrifying thing ever. The hallucinations became even stronger. I was sweating everywhere but I knew I had to act normal if I wanted to get out. So I just walked around the bed.

After being locked for 3 hours in this room, I was sent to a mental hospital which was what I asked for as I thought I was going insane. They gave me a valium which made me feel like my heart was going to stop. They also gave me vitamins. You really think a mental hospital is a place with just depressed people but it is something totally different and terrifying. On top of that, my hallucinations did not stop. I knew they would not do anything for me so I convinced them I was just too drunk and everything was back to normal now. I was sent back home after just a day. I immediately went to my family doctor and he is the one who prescribed me haldol to stop my hallucinations and other medication such as antidepressants and xanax. Imagine the hospital not helping you for 3 days but your family doctor does in 10 minutes. I took haldol for maybe 5 days.

Now I'm back to normal. I've been sober for 2 weeks. I miss alcohol but I was so traumatized. I'm glad I'm on antidepressants and I feel I'm becoming more and more myself again.

What do you think and can you share your experience with delirium tremens/alcoholic hallucinosis, and if you went to the hospital, how did they treat you and stuff? What did they give you?",Alcoholism

Hi this is my first time on this sub but my mom is an alcoholic and through out this past year she?s gotten worse and worse and now she?s lost her job and is just drinking and sleeping me and my brother have to take care of our dogs now and she gets extremely mad at us when we can?t do what she asks. She has said multiple times that she doesn?t want to go to rehab and she can get sober herself but that was over a month ago and now I can?t even talk to her about it without her getting mad at me and she makes everything seem like my fault or blames it on my dad or brother. It?s come to the point where I need to talk to my dad about getting her into a rehab center against her will but I just don?t know how to bring that up. And then my girlfriend says that the next time she?s belligerent that I should call the cops and get her into rehab that way. I hope that this is making sense and I guess I?m asking if anyone has any advice or has experience from a similar situation.

"While withdrawing from alcohol, I was careful to avoid caffeine since I noticed that it would worsen my jitters. Still jittery and reluctant to visit the doctor for benzodiazepines, I wished I had some type of downer to calm the jitters.

I remembered the bottle of bacopa that had purchased for anxiety. It is an herbal supplement and I recalled how tired it had made me. I took two capsules and noticed a dramatic improvement in my withdrawal symptoms. I no longer felt as jittery and if I recall correctly, my insomnia actually subsided.

Afterwards, I decided to look online to see if there was any information relating to bacopa and alcohol withdrawals. I found at least one scientific study, and several articles mentioning that bacopa has been found to help withdrawals, and is used in herbal medicine for that purpose.",Alcoholism

I've come here because I don't really know who else to talk to about it but I've been sober about 5 months now (court appointed breathalyzer 3 times a day) and it has been such a weird mixture of exhausting and refreshing.

Don?t remember or truly embarrassed, that he got caught? He claims she sent him some inappropriate messages and he entertained her some but nothing bad. They were actually hardcore sexting.

He said he plans to tell the Dr. Everything and get help and try different medicine. He has cut down about 50 percent on his drinking but can't get rid of the rest.

He told me he doesn't even enjoy drinking but can't figure out how to break the habit. A few years ago he was a Weeknd only drinker or someone who had a beer on occasion. Then it turned into a beer every night. Then it went to vodka everynite to now it is drinking all day long. I am ashamed to say I didn't know he was drinking at work until he lost his job. Lost it for lack of focus not because they even figured out he was drinking.

Then covid happened and it made everything so much worse. When he needed a Dr. The most we couldn't get in at all and then lost our insurance and jobs.

I love him and want to help but honestly I have no idea how. My next move is to remove all alcohol from the house that is mine and to stop drinking for myself. I need to do that for my own health even though I only drink a few times a week it is not good for my health and waistline ha.

My past: an opiate and a cocaine addiction. Bested them. Haven't touched them for over a decade.

Me now: a mom. A husband. A great career. I'm not always drinking. But when I do, I don't want to stop until I have to. I'm always at work when I need to be. I'm always functional enough. But I'm not present. I know my son sees it. So does my husband.

I'm not the shaky, withdrawal type of alcohol that people think is the common type.

No, I'm the mentally ill, screaming for help, yet terrified to give up that crutch type....",Alcoholism
"I've been in an apartment share with a guy for a few months now - things started great but he's fallen into a pattern of locking himself in his room, drinking until an ambulance is called out due to him being in physical pain, being taken into hospital then released a few days later, to then starting to drink again and repeat the above chain of events.

I've found out that he had a sprint in rehabilitation last year prior to moving in. He's insists he needs the drink to 'save his life' and prevent seizures but I've seen no improvement in the last two months.

I'm beginning to question the validity of his claims - I've noticed he only really talks when he wants alcohol (due to the festive season there's been a lot gifted to me), because he can still string a sentence together I've not really considered that he might be manipulating me into giving him a bottle with compliments and what could be seen as small chit chat.

Unfortunately we have a 24 hour supermarket next to our house so even if I refuse him, he'll go there instead - I'm just conflicted over whether I'm 'feeding' his habit or there's any truth to his fear of seizures due to alcohol withdrawal.",Alcoholism
"I?m trying AA (no judgement about anyone who chooses not to). There have been a lot of great things but some things about AA bother me. I also posted in the AA sub, but I would like to hear opinions of people who aren?t going to automatically defend the program.

Here?s one thing that?s been bothering me?

We are told that if we don?t keep actively working the program, we are dangerously stepping closer and closer to a relapse. We have to keep working all 3 sides of the triangle, stay in the center, live step 10.

This is confirmed by many who have relapsed. They let their lives slip away from the program, relapsed, and are now back to continue doing the work, and to warn others what might happen if you ever stop.

What about the people who stopped ?doing the work? but didn?t relapse? We would never hear from them because, without a relapse, there?s nothing bringing them back to AA to tell the tale.

It?s circular logic that we are told we will relapse if we leave, because the only ones telling us about leaving are the ones who CAME BACK. What about people who slowly distanced over time and who?s lives are not in shambles as a result?

The only acknowledgement I have heard of this from people in AA is that, well, those people must not have been ?real alcoholics.? I do not think this is true at all. I think it?s a little dangerous to gate-keep the legitimacy of addiction? to say that if you?re a ?real? addict, you?re only hope is AA. And if you can survive without AA, you?re not a ?real? addict.

All this being said, I do not take relapse stories lightly. Im not turning up my nose to the advice about ?doing the work.? I am genuinely scared that if I stop doing the work, if I slip from the program, that I may relapse again. And it bothers me that AA has to instill this fear in people. What happened to, ?take what you need, leave the rest??

However I work a very stressful job - dealing with emergency services, drug use, deaths etc- and know that I will have an urge soon. Anyone got any good tips for not drinking?

"I suffer with a form of alcohol addiction. I can easily go days sober. My problem is that when I do have a drink, I drink to excess. It takes two, maybe three drinks to suddenly end up in a mindset that I must drink and drink hard. It's usually beer, rarely spirits or wine. But I have this urge to just go for it. It's leading to regrettable decisions, at the time of drinking and the day after. Sometimes those include secretly drinking (I live with someone) the day after for a little while to ease the ""hangover"". Thing is I also can't tell if it's getting worse or not. A few years ago this behaviour was multiple times a week, now maybe it's once but the drinking days are much, much more intense than before.

However, I didn?t drink it. I haven?t even opened it and now I feel dumb for even buying it. Any who, it?s just sitting in my purse and Im doing laundry.

in the past, i've gotten blackout drunk twice, and then close to it the other times, as i drank all i was able to. i kind of lose control of myself when it's available. the worst was when i was with a different relative, who does drink a lot, and was basically drunk for 5 days straight. i also think about drinking almost all the time. but i feel that, since i can control myself right now since i don't wanna get caught, i don't have any real issues with it.",Alcoholism

Thankfully she was forgiving and more concerned about me but I am sick of needing people?s forgiveness.

I feel pretty mad at myself by the time I?m drunk and every minute until it?s aboit 6:00 pm and then boom I just feel like I?m ?getting the night started?. It?s very ritualistic. Time for 8 voodoo rangers and 2 movies. Gonna be a good night!

"My girlfriend?s ex husband had been alcohol dependent for some time. We have been trying so hard to get him to recognise his problem and seek help but on Christmas Eve we saw him for the first time in 3 weeks and his physical decline was so shocking to see. We decided to ignore his requests for privacy and checked on him a few days ago. We broke into his home and found him collapsed on the floor. After calling for an ambulance we were informed to sit him up and wait for their arrival. He was able to respond to me but was very confused and it was near impossible to understand what he was trying to say. Once the paramedics arrived they started to assess him. They asked me to lie him down but on doing so, his heart stopped beating. He was lifted by the fire brigade from the roof, placed in an induced coma and is currently on a ventilator.

"I am looking for advice on how my wife and I should deal with this.

Our daughter is 22 and has twin 18-month old boys. We have taken over care for them but she still has legal custody.

We just feel bent over a barrel in terms of not enabling her addiction. If we cut off financial support, she?s shown us that she will prioritize drinking and smoking over proper care of the boys.

But if we take on the responsibility, she has the time/money/freedom of responsibility to just go on a bender every day.

The added difficulty is that she?s still in the process of finalizing custody with the twins? ?father?, (I use quotation marks because he?s had very little involvement and is a drug dealer and drug abuser). Our concern is that letting it get to a point where Child Services is involved will give him an opportunity to try and get custody. Not to mention that our daughter isn?t so far gone in her addiction that she couldn?t pull herself together long enough to convince Child Services she?s competent and then cut us off completely.

She?s on a wait list for a detox program, and says she wants to go to a woman?s rehab clinic after that. But she?s talked the talk before and has a history of failing to go through with things.

I am just wondering if there?s a good way to deal with this situation and get her the help and support she needs while at the same time keeping the boys safe, and giving us the sense of security that she can?t just ?feel good at the time? and come and take the boys back then we get a call later that night where she?s drunk and we need to go back and get the boys.",Alcoholism

Without alcohol: I work assiduously through my tasks. It's rather mundane and uninteresting, but I get through them in a timely manner.

With alcohol: Things seem rather less mundane and uninteresting under the influence of alcohol, yet I find myself getting through them in a sluggish and inefficient manner, oftentimes getting distracted and delayed/procrastinative.

I went home and opted out of rehab due to my work responsibilities. I have tried 12 step groups and it just is not for me. Not sure why but I feel like I do not want to rehash the drunk days. I wonder what another option would be besides going to the gym. My only problem I guess now that o don?t drink I have zero social skills.",Alcoholism
"After 5 years of intensive drinking and being a slave to the bottle, I?ve been free for one week. Withdrawals weren?t as bad as I intended (thank goodness). That?s what kept me from getting sober for so long. I was terrified of the withdrawals. I made it through and today I?m feeling better than I have in awhile albeit a little moody still. Still taking vitamins, still drinking water. Will probably start working out soon. I want to be healthy again. Anyone who?s scared of the process please seek help.

"For som context my fathr and my maternal grandfather was and are alcoholics. They have had alot of prpblems with it for many years. I just turned 18 and have started going to home parties and to pubs and clubs.

I find that almost everytime i drink i cant stop myself from drinking more. I dont feel a need to drink and i keep drinking to weekends. But as soon as i get a couple of drinks in me i feel this bruning urge to drink more. I can feel that i shloudnt drink more but i keep drinking anyway. I often get blackout drunk (although ive never passed out) and the day after im deppressed as shit.

I know my problem isnt nearly as bad as it could be but i just want some help to not fall in the same hole my father did.",Alcoholism
"Sweating, shaking, dry heaving. Woke up 5am just now but went down around 12:30. Last time it was like this was a couple months ago accompanied as well by early signs of psychosis/delirium tremens, including auditory hallucinations and seeing shadow figures.

All I had left were four 9% ciders and half a bottle of brandy, and not even that amount was enough to fight off withdrawal for the morning.

I?m terrified and I?m just so tired, man I want this to be the last time. All I have to do is not go get drunk with my whole paycheck when I get this next one.

"Everywhere I look all the resources I find about drinking talk about numbing yourself, and I simply don't relate to that. I feel numb when I'm sober. When I drink I can feel anger at people that have wronged me who otherwise I'd let walk over me, I drink because food tastes better when drunk so I struggle to eat proper when sober, I drink because it makes me love people who deserve love and I hate how distant I otherwise feel. Sadly I struggle to seek help about my emotional issues without having a few drinks first, because I can't talk about my issues otherwise.

She?s cold to me at night and the next morning very loving, but then she usually feels depressed throughout the day as well. It?s hard to confront her with my hurt and anger because she drinks when she is extremely sad and idk what to do.

"My partner quit drinking for 6 weeks and relapsed on Xmas. He got extremely drunk and the next day was super hung over. Then yesterday he had what we think was a seizure while in the ER lobby. He went there because he sneezed and got a very bloody nose and felt very strange. They gave him an IV and Ativan and released him. We went to see his primary care doctor who prescribed gabbapentin, multivitamin, and hydroxizine. His head has been feeling really weird since the day of drinking.

My boyfriend drove my car home and idk what set me off, but I had a horrible panic attack (which definitely happens a lot when i get too drunk). I don?t know what came over me but I unlocked my car door and jumped out of it while it was moving (probably like 15-20mph). I ruined my glasses, nose, knees and elbows.

Its hard for me to recall what I've done the day before, etc. Earlier today I couldn't find the milk in the fridge only to realize I had taken it out moments before and it was on the counter.

Most recently, he started lying about whether he was drinking or not and threw his card at me to buy a breathalyzer. He blew spit, hardly put any air into the thing, and got .15-.17 after 7 weird attempts. He mentioned this scoring was because he drank a lot the day before, and hadn?t brushed his teeth (it was like 9pm the next day). He has been ordering alcohol through delivery services and hides the bottles in his office. I?m not opposed to drinking, but when it?s sneaky or during work hours, it?s troublesome to me.

"Your doctor hasn't heard of it. Your rehab didn't teach you about it. AA won't let people openly discuss it.

Why do you suppose? It's evidence based, clinically proven.

Like most people with this medical condition (AUD) you probably haven't been told about short-term, as-needed, naltrexone and the method of taking it before drinking to help your brain taper down to any level you want (alcohol-free being the healthiest goal). Cravings and obsessive thoughts for alcohol slowly disappear. The brain rewires and heals itself. This method can work for 3 out of 4 people that can stick to the one rule method for 4-12 months.

I?m not sure if it is all in my head, or what. But as the day progressed, I felt worse and worse and thought I was going to have a panic attack. I was able to make Christmas breakfast for my kids and watch them open their presents.

But when we were on our way to my in-laws, I had us stop at a drugstore to get a last minute gift for my father in law. My husband and kids stayed in the car.. I then also bought a few tiny boxes of wine and shoved them in my purse.

I drank them all, and almost immediately felt better and no longer felt as crappy as I did earlier. I did not get drunk at all, and had a mild buzz that wore off fast. I of course told no one, and am terrified. My husband said that if I drink without telling him, he will be furious. But then, when this happens he gets mad at me: so naturally I kept this in secrecy.

I don?t want to drink anymore, but do not have the time nor the means to do inpatient detox. I have to work and take care of my kids. I don?t have any family to help out, and my in-laws hate me as it is.

It?s taking me back to 2020 when she would be shitfaced nearly every day, hiding bottles and shit from us, etc. I don?t know what to do, and the worst part is, I think she knows that and so she takes it as an excuse to keep on doing it, even if it is mentally tearing me apart and ruining my image of ?home?.",Alcoholism

my parents are coming to visit me starting tomorrow, so i can?t bitch and whine all that much.

anyway, the gist is I constantly feel lonely and drinking is how i?m dealing with that. I keep trying to find a reason to stop, but i can?t justify any of them. i?m a bit worried it?s gonna take hitting rock bottom for me to commit to being sober. another part of me is holding out hope that maybe i won?t ever have to cut alcohol out of my life completely, and that maybe i?ll be able to consume in moderation (this has no logic to it since i?ve never been able to moderate before). another part of me is so comfortable in my alcoholism. another part of me is so ashamed of my dependence.",Alcoholism

The second doctor came in and told me they they?re seeing SO MUCH of this because of the stress the last few years. She said ?you?re not alone. I will help you? and gave me some meds in my IV to stop shaking and then wrote me a Rx to help at home. I sobbed because I was so grateful.

"I have been avoiding bars since quitting. But I couldn't this weekend. I was out of town for an event and our leader decided we would all meet at the hotel bar to discuss our upcoming program. I didn't want to go, but if I didn't I would be missing out on important strategy planning of a project we have coming up. So, I had fear of missing out....but not of fun or companionship. Fear of missing vital information to this project we are doing.

So I went. And when the waitress came, I refused to even acknowledge her at first. Rude. But I was afraid I would order something I didn't want to if I did. I finally told her I didn't want anything and got an very awkward look from her. Everyone else ordered alcoholic beverages. And consumed them. In front of me. And it was torture. I was so distracted that I didn't even pay attention to what was said.

When there was finally a pause in the action, I excused myself from the table. But instead of leaving like I knew I should have, I went to the bar. While I was at the bar, everyone was ordering their second round. I got the attention of the bartender. She came over to take my order and......I asked her if she could make me a virgin margarita on the rocks. And she did. And that is what I returned to the table with. And then I ordered a second one from the waitress when she came around again about a half hour later.

And it worked. And I did it. I was very, very tempted to not include the ""virgin"" part of my order. But I did. And I didn't end up have 5-6 regular ones. And I didn't embarrass myself in front of everyone. And I didn't wake up with a hangover forcing me to drag ass all day. I actually did. I feel good about it. I wanted to share. But I also don't ever want to feel that level of temptation again. It is the most I have had since starting this journey this time around.",Alcoholism
"I?m reasonably new here, I?ve been lurking for a couple of weeks and have finally built up the courage this morning to quit drinking.

I have depression that has been worsening, and I?ve been fooling myself thinking that alcohol helps me relax and chill out when in actual fact it brings out my anger issues, makes me more suicidal, and makes me do stupid things.

I am a mother of two young boys. I can?t be that person. I owe it to them, my husband, my friends and most importantly MYSELF to be better.

"I?m a big fan of interesting dates, so I was excited when I realized my one year would fall on 2/2/22.

I feel like I don?t deserve to celebrate one year because I wasn?t a ?problem drinker? and I didn?t hit a rock bottom. In fact I?ve retyped and deleted this post a few times. I didn?t make not drinking a public thing, I just casually declined opportunities, so it?s not like extended people in my life are aware I wasn?t drinking, but I?m still proud of doing what I set out to do, one day at a time and want to be able to celebrate with someone.

With a significant number of alcoholics in my family, I could see how easily it could become a problem for me. I was counting the days a week I was drinking, tracking how many drinks I had to make sure it wasn?t too many, but excited about the next one.

Met with my GI specilists for the first time today it turned out okay. I was diagnosed 2 weeks ago and made a follow up appointment with his office that was set for this morning. I was nervous because he had some not so great google reviews but I found the office staff and the doctor himself perfectly fine which is always good. He wanted to check my swelling on my legs which he did and mentioned they look much better which they sure do along with my stomach. He asked me if I had been drinking since being released I let him know not a single drop. Asked me if I had anymore symptoms since leaving I let him know no throwing up nausea etc the usual suspects he drew blood and sent it off to a lab for testing which I will receive a call Thursday with the results also set up another appointment next month exactly. So nothing really happened but I feel like thats almost a good thing I am kind of nervous of the blood tests coming in but I have been eating good and exercising so im hoping the numbers come back better oh he also looked at my jaundice and said with time it'll get better so im happy for that...just wanted to post this to vent and let it out thank you,Alcoholism

"binge drinker here.

It's been 9 days since I've had a drink. I promised myself I would go a month without touching any alcohol to assess how/if I can handle it.

It was very easy to abstain during the week but once it hit Friday the cravings got super intense. I noticed that I was incredibly bored and agitated. I kept thinking about how much a glass of wine would help to enhance whatever I was doing (like cooking for example).

I made sure to stay very busy. I'm very lucky and grateful for my boyfriend who was incredibly helpful and supportive.",Alcoholism
"I?ve always been a runner. As I got into my 40s I found myself aching more after runs, feeling worse the next day, and just not having the same energy as I did when I was younger. Then in summer of 2020 I had a hip injury caused by many years of running. Combined with the pandemic, well my drinking really ramped up. After recovering from hip injury, I tried running again, but the hip was alway sore, legs felt worse, and I figured it was time to hang up the running shoes.

Fast forward to early this month (last drink on Nov 13th of 2021), I?m feeling more energetic than I have in years, so I start doing some short runs on the treadmill. I notice I can do 2 miles of running plus some waking without hip pain, and, amazing to me, my legs feel good and the next day I feel like I can do more. Then one day I feel great, and I tell myself I think I can run 5 miles?.so 45 minutes later, I?m done with the 5 miles! I figured I would be hurting the next day (yesterday) and I woke up and my legs barely hurt at all. Another 3 yesterday and 4 today and I feel like my old self!

Now this might not be tied to not drinking, it I sure think it is. I?m not dehydrated from drinking, my body can use it?s energy on healing muscles from working out and not ridding itself of toxins, I?m sleeping better which obviously helps with recovery, I?m not having the drinking shits, so my body is keeping the nutrients it needs, and best of all, my hip doesn?t hurt nearly as much! It?s amazing what the body can do when not drinking!

TL:DR: quit drinking, able to run again like I did in my 20s/30s",Alcoholism

"I feel pretty stupid for deciding to drink again. Being sober was going really well. I was sleeping well, walking a lot of steps daily, eating well, keeping up with all my responsibilities and getting out for hikes on the weekend.
Then there was a death in my family. My online course felt too overwhelming to keep up with. I started to fall out of my good routines.

Then I drank 1 night. I tried to resist. My partner and I had both admitted we were thinking about it then he went and bought some. I sat for a couple hours, glass of wine already poured but trying to resist, knowing I didn?t want to throw away my progress and start the cycle.

Caved. Told myself it wouldn?t happen again. Blackout, don?t remember going to bed. The next morning I felt so crappy. Tried to power through but drank again ?to take the edge off?. Blacked out again. Argued with my partner. Don?t remember going to sleep again. Attempted to go for a walk and do some chores the next day but still felt so off. Anxious, even my vision felt weird, my entire body felt weird. So we drank again. Not as much as the previous nights. It didn?t really make me feel any better but I do remember going to bed.

This has to come to an end now. It?s so easy to fall back into the cycle of feel crappy, drink, feel crappy from drinking, drink again. It feels like life on hard mode. Basic responsibilities feel so so difficult. Just trying to keep my plants and fish alive and not let my home turn into a total wreck feels so hard but it is the bare minimum. All I want to do is curl up in bed but the anxiety is so bad there?s no way I can sleep the day away.

So today I will shower. I will go for a walk. Try to read for my class. But my main goal, the very most important, is to not drink today, no matter how uncomfortable it is.",Alcoholism

And I have no friends without it. Our social lives are completely intertwined. Our professional lives are intertwined. I can?t maintain the status quo of my life without this component and it?s making me furious and so very, very resentful.

"I need to quit drinking. I've been a heavy drinker for 10 years, so I'm probably at a high risk for DT's and dying from quitting cold turkey... but I also know that I don't have the self control to slowly wean off.

I have come to terms with the fact that I can never be a ""casual drinker."" Even if I have the best intentions to stop at three beers, once I start, I cannot stop. It's been that way when I started in my early 20's to curb my social anxiety (the false sense that I'm more fun/outgoing when I'm drunk, when in reality, I just make an ass of myself. The only difference between then and now is that I'm more self-aware of my actions the morning after lol). I'm not sure what to do from here, but I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired, so to speak. I don't want to be an active alcoholic anymore.

Can anyone share their experiences with quitting cold turkey, going through withdrawals, etc? I know I can Google the information, but it helps to hear from real life experiences to know what to expect as I close this chapter in my life. And, Google convinced me that I will die from withdrawal, which just adds to my anxiety about quitting. I don't want to die...

Being addicted to a physically addictive drug that produces a euphoric high is not abnormal, it?s something that humans seek out and crave.

The abnormal part is abstaining from something that has almost immediate positive effects and triggers an intense endorphin rush.

"Long story short, my partner ended our relationship out of the blue and he said some things that confirmed my worst fears about myself.

I had already been struggling mentally and emotionally and this felt like the last straw. After he dumped me I sat in the parking lot and sobbed for a long time while internally debating what to do. In the past when I've felt this bad it feels like the only option is to drink to distance myself from the absolutely crushing emotional pain. Of course this is only a temporary, shitty band aid and I feel worse in the long run.

It was really hard but I didn't drink. This isn't a great success story because I did use eating disorder behaviors to cope, but in the past I would have used alcohol on top of that and it would have exacerbated everything. I was considering relapsing into self-injury, too, but I managed not to. So I guess I'm making a tiny bit of progress.

I spent the weekend with my mom (God bless her, she's a saint) and honestly I was a completely miserable mess but I knew drinking wouldn't make anything better.

I'm back to work today and my life is feeling slightly more manageable although I still have a long way to go. I know it's no huge accomplishment but I'm trying to cling to every little bit of positivity I can find.

"Been reading here last few days. So like 6 years ago I stopped drinking. The first 4 years, I didn't drink at all. Then, up until recently I only had a celebratory drink here and there. But I got the itch to have a drink this past weekend and 1 drink turned into 10. Holy hell-my entire mind, body and soul hated me the next day(s).

It's like my brain went dumb. Focus? Forget it. Hand-eye coordination, gone. I don't know if anyone will know what I'm talking about - but even my vision felt shaky. Along with my vision, my hands and legs were unsteady - like a baby horse learning to walk.

I felt emotionally drained. Before having these drinks - I was fairly mentally stable. After drinking? I felt intense guilt. The kind that makes your heart hurt. I'm having like flashbacks to being drunk and it's giving me anxiety as if I suffered some kind of trauma - even though I didn't (aside from maybe what I put my liver through.) The emotional aspect is so severe that I feel like the only way through them is to isolate myself for a few days until they are back in order. My whole shit was thrown out of whack.

That's not even including the inability to sleep even though you feel beat and exhausted. Or the headaches. Or that stomach ache where you feel super hungry but have no appetite? I mean wtf is that? I'd also like to point out - a side effect I never had before - but I felt fever-ish.

ALL of these negative side effects... and for what? I have never appreciated being sober more than I do now. I didn't drink for a long time and I haven't felt any of these awful side effects for so long that I underestimated how bad a ""hangover"" is. It's been 48 hours and I'm only starting to feel better - still not 100% though.

"I've been sober since 17th August 21 after drinking all of my adult life but for the past 7 years drinking heavily every day.

At first I felt great, I was enjoying the challenge of being sober. I changed my routine to keep busy, joined a gym, slowly starting to get my physique back, booked to climb a mountain in Italy in July of this year. I needed something to focus on and keep motivated for.

Now that the novelty of being sober has worn off I'm just sad all the time. I find no pleasure in doing anything that I used to find pleasure in. I find it hard to be able to be intimate with my partner while sober so I make excuses when she makes advances or wants sex. Our relationship has been strained since I got sober because I just don't feel like I'm the same person I was when I was drinking. We met and got together when I was drinking so she has never really known me sober. She's an amazing woman and we have so much in common and such similar interests and backgrounds. But I just push her away time and time again.

Getting together with family is tough when we go out for meals etc because they all drink, and while I have no desire to drink, I can't be on the same level as them because, well, they're all drunk and it's just annoying. Being the only sober one in a group of drunk people you realise how much crap people talk when they're drunk. It usually ends up with me making excuses and going home because I just don't want to be around them.

I just feel so fucking lonely. Lonely when I'm with people and lonely when I'm not.

"My drinking has been getting out of control the past couple months. I?ve been really stressed about my job, bills, and my living situation. I?ve also been really unhappy with the way my body has been looking. Facing those feelings made me so deeply uncomfortable and unhappy. I don?t know how to see problems without just laying down in it. Being completely weighed down by everything. So instead I?d just go out, drink, meet new ?friends?, because it made me feel like even if I suck at everything else, even if I hate everything else about myself and my life, I can at least be the person that?s good at being social and making other people like me. At least for the night.

But last night one of my new ?friends? gave me what I thought was coke (another fucking alcohol related problem entirely), and I?m pretty sure it was ghb instead. I was too drunk to remember if there was a difference in the smell/taste, but after 10 minutes, I was completely incapacitated.

I took it right before I was leaving to go home, since I thought it would sober me up, but within a few minutes into my drive(another fucking issue I hate myself for), I realized I was fucked. So I called my boyfriend who only lives 5 minutes away from the bar I was at and told him I needed to come over. I told him that I?d been roofied. And I had. But I did it to myself because I was too fucking drunk to think about any potential risks. I took drugs from a stranger, because why not, and I fucking got roofied.

The look of fear in his eyes while he was struggling to keep me conscious is something that?s going to haunt me forever. The amount of pain I?ve put him through because I couldn?t just face my fucking problems.. I hate myself for it.

I don?t want to live like this anymore. I don?t want to keep wishing for a better life while avoiding even looking at the things I could improve to get me that life. It?s so fucking backwards. I hate so much how I?ve hurt him. But I finally hate how much I?ve been hurting myself too.

"I just wanted to thank this sub for helping me get through day 1 after I had probably the worst relapse and truly truly crippled my relationship with my parents. I keep having mental flashbacks of that night and my parents can barely look at me.

For those that have found positives in getting out of this rut without finding themselves fighting the solution with the problem - have you got any pointers on how you fixed things with your loved ones and friends?

Short story, I went out Saturday night and got so far blacked out that my mate had to get a taxi with me to my house and get me through the door. Followed by me passing out on the stairs and my parents calling an ambulance because I wasn?t responsive, after I was put into bed I got up and urinated on the floor in my room - my dad heard and tried to stop me but couldn?t.

Now neither one of my parents can look at me. The thought of what I did, the selfishness of my drinking followed by my actions makes me sick to my core, and the guilt is just eating me alive. I?m very lucky to have them and they are the last people I want to hurt but have ended up being the very people I have hurt the most.

I sent text messages I would give anything to have not sent. I think I weirded out the guy I?ve been talking to. The first guy I have a chance with since my ex dumped me on Thanksgiving. Dumped me for saying shit I don?t even remember saying because I was drunk then too.

"I decided that I wasn?t happy with my relationship with alcohol.

I had been drinking every night for years. No major drama or disaster, but restless sleep, a bloated face and that terrible taste in your mouth the following morning were constant parts of my life.

Even worse then the physical symptoms, though, was all the lost time. 6pm would roll around, I would start drinking and my ability to engage with the world would quickly fade away.

The first two weeks not drinking sucked. I was clearly physically dependent on alcohol, especially to sleep, and finding the patience to let my body sort itself out was hard.

I?ve not been perfect. My badge reflects that. I?ve drank 3 times over the past year. Having seen what life is like without alcohol, though, has let me brush myself off each time and get back on the wagon.

Thanks to the stopdrinking community for helping to make this possible. This sub is truly a gift.",Alcoholism
"Doing this to keep myself accountable.

Yesterday my boyfriend and I hosted a game night. It was my 13th day sober. I got up and cleaned and prepared for the party. My boyfriend and I were arguing a lot. He was triggering me and so was the party.

I said fuck it. My dad situation, my boyfriend situation, the way the world is and my addiction got the best of me.

So, here I am again. Day 1. Nothing bad happened, everyone had a great time and I really enjoyed it. One person got way too drunk and fell and lit a cigarette in the house. Wasn?t me though. But I was easily on my way if I hadn?t recognized the wall between drunk and completely dysfunctional. I thank my work I?ve put in to being sober for that.",Alcoholism

"I've not admitted to anyone, even my wife (she knows...), but I have a problem.

For all of my adult life (I'm 38 now) I've suffered periods of heavy panic attacks that went so far that I pretty much couldn't leave the house for about two years. Thankfully I am doing much better now, alcohol or not.

But those days were the days when I started drinking daily. When I have a couple of beers, even ""only"" 3 or 4, I don't felt so anxious anymore. I could go into the city and have fun, go outside and enjoy the weather and time with friends. For a couple of years I felt like alcohol really pulled me through when I needed it the most.

Thanks to plenty of therapy I've been doing fine now for about 7 years. The anxiety will never leave me it will be a part of me for as long as I live, but I can live with it and live a full life but... The alcohol is still there.

I am now a father of a baby girl and a 2 year old boy. They mean the world to me, more every day. But I still make sure I have beer in the House that I can drink when their mother goes to sleep. When all three are out of the house I sometimes start drinking during the day.

My stomach hurts sometimes. I'm out of shape and when I don't drink for a couple of weeks I feel so much better and more energetic but there is always an excuses. A party, friends coming over for dinner, anything, to start again.

I want to quit. I want to be healthy and be an active dad and take care of my kids for as long as I can, I want to see them grow up. Because I have a stable job and only drink in the evenings when my wife has gone to bed I keep telling myself it's not that bad. But really I know it is...

Oh I can quit. When we were trying for kids I didn't drink for months so my little swimmers were healthy at least. But when I get the chance I always start drinking again and I can't explain why.

Like a lot evenings I will tell myself the same thing. Tomorrow I will quit. But then we have a party Saturday... I will just think about it tomorrow.",Alcoholism
"I have been drinking between 17 and 20 standard drinks (vodka) a day for at least 5 years. This is accompanied by 1 to 2 liters of pop (Mountain Dew or Dr Pepper) a day as well.

Recently my feet, legs, arms, and hands have began hurting. I am on my feet for work so this was something I simply couldn?t live with. My 8 hours a day at work are the only 8 hours a day I?m sober and the pain was unbearable. I have come to the conclusion I am suffering from nerve neuropathy induced by a very poor diet, hardly eating, and only drinking vodka and pop. So I didn?t drink last night in my night off. 6 hours after my last drink I threw up. Then 7 hours. Then 8 hours. Then I finally got some sleep.

I have woken up today to find the pain in my feet and legs is already almost completely gone. The relief is amazing. I threw up one more time this morning but have been keeping down water and orange juice.",Alcoholism

Mostly it happens at work. My job even knows I?m sober - only because I used to go out every night after work, and all the sudden stopped joining the party for the last 2 years. But I feel like i?m being judged the same way I was drinking. Like people can tell I am lying and hiding something. Or if people are checking to see if i?ve drank etc etc

"I usually drink approx 2 nights a week and my usual amount is less than a flask of rum. I feel like my drinking problem is pretty minor compared to a lot of people who suffer with alcohol use disorder, but it does cause some issues in my life.

I tried so many times to stop but honestly I do still have a lot of fun when I drink, and I behave myself. So instead of keeping on trying and failing to quit altogether, my plan is to drink only once per week and the deal is, every time I drink, I will spend a significant portion of the evening exercising or working out.

Working out after a few drinks makes me feel like I am at least offsetting some of the negative effects of alcohol abuse, and honestly, it makes the exercise more fun. Of course, I am being safe about it. There are no free weights involved or anything that can hurt me. Just my stationary bike usually with a resistance band attached to it.

I am also really trying to lose weight, so this was a great way for me to offset the tonne of calories that come with alcohol.

Now I have about 4 mental disorders and many broken relationships and values to show for it.

I am still in pain. Even more so now that I can see the damage I have done. And for what? I had the best childhood anyone could ask for so every ounce of blame is on me. Most days I?m just angry with myself. Some days i?m angry at the substance and our society and the fact that it loves alcohol. I?ve been warned of the substance copious times but it rings empty when the whole world is drinking.

I try not to associate with that person too much as that might make me kill myself. If that is morally correct, I don?t know.

It's still unbelievable how much has changed in those two months. I'm in the best shape I've been in since 2016 and my skin is finally clearing up.

I used to be a college athlete and I?ve been working out every day focusing on my mind and body for the first time in years.

"A month from now will mark 2 years of abstinence from alcohol and tobacco for me. This is my first attempt at sobriety, so I know the stats are not on my side.

I grew up with depression. My earliest memory of wanting to kill myself is at age 10. I never planned a future for myself because as soon as I had consciousness, I knew I?d be dead soon. So why would I ever even consider not drinking? The future wasn?t bleak. It simply wasn?t a possibility. Alcohol was just there to help me pass the time until my inevitable death. I started drinking as a teen and I was never very social so I was a lonely drinker from the beginning. Once I started earning my own money, I was up to burning half a 5L (1.3 gal) box of red wine every night. Uni was the first time I made friends, and I started smoking with them, too. It seemed like a good social habit.

I skipped morning classes regularly. I would somehow drag myself out of bed early, in order to drive to uni (sometimes still drunk from the night before) and pass out in the parking lot for a few hours so that my parents didn?t realize how big my problem was. So much work and putting myself and others in danger to keep up appearances. Somehow, I graduated. With a degree in a field I grew to hate from an institution that I consider deeply corrupt and outright evil.

Then came a few years of bumming around with a shitty job bringing in just enough to keep me sheltered and drunk. Still, money was getting tight. By the start of 2020, I had tapered my drinking. I was down to only a bottle of wine a night. Maybe two if there was a special. ?This is fine,? I figured. I could afford the basics and my work didn?t notice/care.

Around early January 2020 I ate some psychedelic mushrooms. For the first part of the trip, I laughed hard at a tv sketch comedy show and afterwards, I went to the bathroom. As I was washing my hands I stared into the mirror and I heard the ?presence? of the mushrooms telling me that I?m gaining nothing from drinking, smoking, or taking psychedelics. I would be happier if I stopped. ?How weird? I thought. Drugs telling me to stop taking drugs.

A few weeks later, on March 26 2020, my country went into a hard lockdown. Not only stay at home orders, but the sale of alcohol and tobacco was also banned.

A thought hit me with someone else?s voice. ?This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to quit. Your supply has legally been taken away.? And to make sure of it, I smoked part of one more cigarette and threw the rest of the box away. That last cigarette was so disgusting to me that I couldn?t finish it.

And now, nearly 2 years later, through a devastating pandemic and one of the harshest lockdowns in the world, I?ve discovered my future.

I spent the last two sober years studying up and gaining two minor certifications. I read a handful of excellent books. So far, knocks on wood I haven?t felt a serious craving for either drug. I don?t think I was ever addicted to alcohol; as weird as that might sound. Its absence isn?t as severely felt as some of the other people talk about here. I miss being drunk sometimes but now think of ethanol primarily as a solvent. I occasionally have dreams where I smoke and immediately regret it, only to be welcomed by the immense relief to wake up to the realization it was only a dream.

Last week, thanks to those certifications, I got a job offer in a field I actually enjoy. I have just started a correspondence degree in a subject I like and am good at, with the bonus that it?ll make me even more employable. I still feel depressed some days, but we?re old friends now and I know how to talk it down to a manageable level. I haven?t attempted suicide in nearly 6 years. I haven?t even fantasized about it since I quit.

I don?t know who was in my body, running that existence until 2 years ago. I?m not sure there was anyone in here. Now I have friends. A therapist. Healthy relationships. I can even imagine a future for myself, and a life I?d like to lead.

I am alive for the first time in my life. So, hello world, how have you been?",Alcoholism

I'm just curious if my doctor could help me get past two weeks. If there's a medication that can help with cravings? Or even maybe that one pill that makes you sick if you drink?

I know myself well enough that I cannot moderate for shit, and I am glad I have finally realized that, but it does not make it any easier. Especially over the weekends, mainly Friday and Saturday. My question is, does it get any easier with time or does the voice become at least a little easier to ignore as I go on?

Even though I'm in a terrible place physically and mentally, I'm weirdly grateful for it because I know this is a turning point to really look after myself and quit. It's not even just liquor as I really don't drink much but it put's me in such a dark place and ruins any progress I had in other areas of life

I wish I had the energy to type more at the moment but getting this far was a struggle. I really appreciate the community and all the love it gives when people are in need as just a little love goes a long way.",Alcoholism
"Focusing on attempt number, the first time I decided I was done with booze was the day after my wedding in 2014. I made it nearly 4 years sober and built a life that was unimaginable in my drunken years. I drank and kinda kept it under control for a good year, then quickly spiraled as we all know, then it was attempt after attempt to gain sobriety again. Ive made it weeks, ive made it 3 months, but most recently im at 15 days. I'm now very desperate to be sober for good and on Disulfiram for the first time. thanks for being here, I need to reset my badge but im going to do it at 30 days for some sort of goal.",Alcoholism
"My sober friends are always coming up with fancy non alcoholic drinks to try and prove that I don?t need alcohol to enjoy those kinds of indulgences. Unfortunately, they just don?t get it. ?Mocktails? just don?t do it for me, and I usually just end up wishing there was booze in it either way.

Does anyone have any suggestions of things that worked for them in distracting from the urges? Either drinks, activities, anything to keep my mind off the bad stuff and still entertain myself in those moments?",Alcoholism
"It feels like everytime I get on the sober track, life comes along and places a perfect opportunity to drink right in front of me. It feels like a cosmic tease. A test of ?here you go, it?s right there for ya, you don?t even have to do anything?, making it so easy to give in.

"That's what my partner said to me when I asked if he could tell a difference since I quit drinking. Namely, my moods and anxiety and how I handle them is so much better now. It was so much harder when I was drunk every day. Everything was so much fucking harder.

There are many things that have made it worth it for me to quit. Hearing him say that is a huge one. Thank you for being here for me, SD community.",Alcoholism
"Drank a fifth+ a day for a good half a year up until last Tuesday. Went to the ER, expecting them to commit me and medicate me. Nope. Gave me some lorazepam thru an IV, a script for TWELVE librium, and told me to kick rocks.

NOT ONLY THAT. They gave me instructions to follow up with a detox center the next day, so I did. They said the soonest they could get me in with the doctor that was recommended, was in fucking APRIL. Like what am I supposed to do until then, just keep drinking my life away? I asked for a different doctor and they gave me an appointment for a week later.

My prescription said to take four pills daily as needed. So I did. But when I went to get a refill, they said they couldn't because ""it's a powerful sedative"". Apparently the doctor neglected to tell me I was supposed to TAPER the pills. I thought they were supposed to hold me over until I could get admitted.",Alcoholism

I'm not gonna lie, this doesn't feel better than 6+ hours of drunk sleep. Not that that makes it not worth it, there's a million reasons it's still worth it. I don't have to lie to myself and say I feel better right now than if I had drank. It's the start of day two... I expect it. Here's wishing I could call off.

Ultimately we decided that we are not compatible and to break up.

"Five years ago I made my first Reddit account just for the purpose of joining this community. Through the support here and real life changes I was able to curb by alcohol abuse. Recently this has changed.

I don?t know really where to begin with this confession. Drinking has been creeping back into my life, mostly without major consequences. My spouse has never agreed with me that I have a drinking problem. The therapist I was working with never reacted negatively when I confided in her that I had begun drinking again. She said as long as I examined why I was looking for it and the reasons weren?t bad it was okay. I think she wanted me to disconnect the feelings of guilt I have.

Yesterday was a beautiful ?false spring? day where I live. I decided to have a post lunch margarita, carefully measuring out 3.5 oz of tequila so I can be responsible. It hit me really hard. Hard enough that I went back for one more. And I did stop at just the two drinks. The problem is that around midnight I realized I blacked out and didn?t know it.

Apparently I went out in the middle of making dinner and came back to about an hour later. I checked the trash that I did in fact make food for both my kids. I don?t remember making it. I do remember sitting one bowl on the counter and thinking, or maybe saying aloud, one more to go. I remember calling my kids in and laughing with my son because he was so tired from being out all day. ?That?s just what kids do!? I remember telling him. I don?t remember my kids eating or putting the dishes away. I know I sent my other kid outside to grab a cup and telling them to shower. I don?t know what we talked about or if I even talked at all.

In the moment it felt like i had been normal all day. I fully came back to myself laying on the couch hearing my husband come home and getting up to brush my teeth. The rest of the night I remember. It wasn?t until I woke up in the middle of the night shaking that I realized I couldn?t remember cooking.

Anyway. I?ve done this enough times that I know there is no changing it and all I can do is move forward and be better. It?s time for me to commit to sobriety again.

I will not drink with you today.",Alcoholism
"You guys, we're expecting 2-3 days of snow, and I didn't have to calculate how much booze I'm going to need being snowed-in. I got some sparkling waters, but those are a fraction of the cost of booze and I drink much less of them in quantity.



I remember running (driving) to the store that's 1/2 mile away (while buzzed) during the beginning of a snow storm to get more booze and had to somehow drive up a hill that was iced over. Super dangerous! Really dumb. I never would have done that if I was sober.

"Every day is yet another new day, a new beginning. Sounds all bright and glorious on paper. No, it's not the grind of the Day I.

It's that irk every time I hit a milestone. The ""yeah, I did it!"" and then I'm in uncharted territory. This span, after 69ing, I've done before. But much beyond that...

My best was 78 days last year. I have a vacation next week, so I'm pretty safe to 90 and 100 days. But. It's the worry of how I'll feel then.

The ""What now?""

This recovery, at least, has been the easiest so far. Two recoveries ago, I was still putting together a ""how to recover"" strategy. Last recovery, I was tried to fall back into those slowly forming habits. And this recovery, it's building upon those successes. But beyond around now, I'm not sure where to go.

Won't lie, I certainly have those ""what is the point of living"" whispers. The ""where am I going?"" The ""well, I can always 86 myself if I can't handle it."" My depression isn't crippling, but I'm always on the lookout for intrusive thoughts. (If it must be said, my depression was FAR FAR worse when I was perivodka. I am almost mentally STABLE now!)

I don't have any cravings. But I didn't (have any cravings before my) last relapse, either. Until I did have cravings. I knew it was going to be a binge, that one shot would mean a dozen, but I did it anyway.

So forgive me if I sound like a pair of 'noids.

I know the DayCounts can be intimidating, but I overall feel there's no gatekeeping here. Remember, veteran sobernauts and those that are sobercurious: we're all one shot away from the same fate.",Alcoholism
I had my first session with a substance abuse counselor yesterday and I think it went pretty well! I?m starting naltrexone and will be gradually tapering off my drinking.

I think I?m going to finally try sobriety after years of justifying and reasons that I don?t have a problem. I blacked out on Sunday at 7pm and have no recollection on the rest of the evening.

"If alcohol is so fanbloodytastic why do so many of us keep returning here? We clearly aren?t getting our needs met there. Yet on this side some of us still think we are missing out.. I keep seeing ?day one again? posts today - I?d put money on most of us having written a good few of those.

I need to remind myself that if I?m really missing out then why do I keep coming back here. The best I felt was when I didn?t drink. Having pride in myself feels better than anything drink offers.",Alcoholism
"It's not worth it. I don't know why I ever felt like it was. I don't know why after a few days not drinking my brain thinks having a drink will make everything so ?fun? and great.

It doesn't.

The past few weeks, every Monday I go into work hungover or just tired generally from Sunday night, I think, I don't want my mornings to feel like this anymore.

Last week I hadnt had any alcohol for 4-5 days, drank a bottle of wine plus some on Valentine's, went into work the next day feeling terrible. Decided that was it then too. Made it a week until Presidents day, had too many beers, and now here I am. Tired, groggy, fuzzy, unmotivated, I feel unprepared. And I'm going to drag my butt into work where I have to teach (no sitting somewhere with a coffee trying to make it through the day, no, I'll be up in front of hundreds of students having to be ""on"" and energetic while I feel like death).

I just flat out don't want to do this anymore.",Alcoholism
"I live in a city where patio drinking/brunch is a big event and one I've used as just another excuse to get drunk and make bad decisions for many years now. It's a warm week here and I live in a neighborhood chock-full of patios and restaurants and the tables were packed with folks Sunday Funday-ing this weekend, heartily laughing, clinking their glasses and enjoying the sunshine.

And I was jealous y'all. For the first time since I quit drinking on Jan 15 I was so tempted to just say eff it, grab a table with my husband and join in on the fun! But I ""played the tape forward"" as I've read so many times here. About how I'd want to stop and grab another bottle of champs on the way home to watch my Sunday night shows drunk. How I'd sleep like garbage. How I'd feel at work this week. How I'd hate that I gave in to the call of the wild.

Getting sober is forcing me to reevaluate who I spent my time with, how we never did anything without drinking, all of the money I threw away every Sunday to get wastey, I mean hell it was part of our identity. Going back through my old FB posts I always had a drink in my hand with my ""friends."" Inevitably someone would end up in tears over a man. One time I witnessed an acquaintance yell at her kids in public and her ex-husband had to be called to pick them up - they were sobbing, begging their mom to stop drinking. It was so sad. But we never blamed the alcohol. Oh no you can't go there. She just needed to learn how to manage herself.

Another time during a Sunday Funday I took a shot of tequila after all the mimosas I had downed and got sick in the restaurant bathroom. Classy.

And yet another time I made the smart decision to get drunk at brunch with my FWB, pick up someone's baby at the bar, have him ditch me there (not the baby lol) and text him relentlessly and show up at his house uninvited. His roommates had to call me a cab and ask me to leave. I was blocked everywhere after that.

I still cringe when I think about all of the stupid ways I embarrassed myself when I got drunk on a Sunday. But I really wanted to this weekend. So glad I didn't.",Alcoholism
"I went to dinner with a friend yesterday. I had a few glasses of wine. I came home, started my 678th new playthrough of Skyrim, and went to bed.

I did not get drunk. I am not hungover. I did not detour my uber to a liquor store to pick up more wine to 'keep the party going' at home like I normally would.

I'm really proud of myself. I also know that next time we're going to a Thai place so I don't order wine again. I was strong this time but I don't want to test myself again.

I'm not even going to try to moderate because I already know I can't. I'm really glad I didn't get drunk. I'm really glad I recognize that that doesn't mean I can keep doing that. So, I won't.",Alcoholism

Not really having a ""morning"" but just jumping right into the day. Well last night I set my alarm for 6:30, ended up waking up 10 mins before the alarm went off. Not gonna lie, I laid in bed for an hour on Reddit and YouTube before I got up and took my dog for a nice morning walk around the nearby pond. Came back and made tea and eggs then walked over to work. This day has been good so far and I attribute it to getting an early start on the day by waking up earlier. This would never happen if I had drank alcohol the night before. I'd be way too tired lol. Got to work a little early and been smashing through tasks all day. Hope everyone is enjoying the weather.

"What is the void? I would argue that deep inside each addict there is a void. Something that we all need to take care of in our own ways. Many things can create the void I suspect. For me, I am uncertain what it is for sure, I have my suspicions of course, but that is for another time. For this discussion, it is not relevant. Some do not recognize their void, but begin filling it anyway out of instinct.

I quit drinking somewhere around September 2020. Something that I have come to terms with is that I have a fragile mind and it is my responsibility to gate-keep it better. I do not keep a sober date because I will not allow that in my mind. I do not want to think about it. One of the first things I noticed is that my void was calling. I didn?t feel like myself, I was empty; and my mind was always thinking of what it thinks would make me whole ? booze.",Alcoholism
So I?ve been home since Friday after a few weeks away for an assignment. I spent the weekend getting the apartment slowly straightened out. SO is an alcoholic as well and the apartment was a biohazard to say the least. Had cleaners come it was so bad. Yesterday I made a doctors appointment to follow up after my hospital experience last month in which I blacked out and ended up at the ER. Wanted to have blood work done and just make sure that I didn?t do permanent damage. Well power steering feels sluggish. SO has been driving vehicle ?I didn?t notice anything wrong with it? seems like power steering fluid is almost empty?. Ugh borrowed SOs vehicle made my appointment waiting on results on labs but GP said that he?s not to concerned. SO goes to the car to see if there?s leftover alcohol in it in the middle of the night in which we find out our apartment had the vehicle towed because the parking permit they gave us was already expired. Can?t do anything about that for a few more hours. But then had to have the conversation with my SO that they should not be driving my vehicle when it?s low on fluids and to just stop at the tow place on the way to work and pick up their vehicle. Just trying to talk logic when their drunk but don?t really think they are is beyond irritating and gosh I was sleeping real good before I got woken up to that. Everything in me right now is screaming I want a drink and I know that it won?t fix anything and I won?t get my car taken care of and everything will spiral even further out of control. It just feels like everything is stacked against me some days.,Alcoholism

Work, kids, wife, more work, it has been a never ending cycle of rinse and repeat.

"Been reading about it and was wondering if anyone has experience working this method? The Sinclair Method is the patient takes naltrexone (blocks the drunk ""buzz"") before drinking. The claim is after a few months your brain stop associating alcohol with the dopamine reward and cravings go away.

Curious if anyone has had success with the Sinclair Method?",Alcoholism
"So this is the first weekend I was home since I stopped drinking. Normally I watch my kids, and my default as soon as my wife leaves for work is to crack a beer. This weekend, as I watched her leave , my immediate thought was ""okay, time to go to the gas station right down the road and get started.""

It was more surprising than anything, because every morning now I wake up and intentionally say ""I choose to not drink today"".

As soon as I thought it, I stopped and repeated my mantra a few times until I felt the urge go away, but it's still so crazy to me how strong my habits are after the last 11 years of heavy drinking.

As i stopped drinking, i realized I do not want any more kids. I accepted this truth and broke off the relationship. It was tough. I felt guilty.

I'm not looking for sympathy.....it's quite the opposite. I feel horrible for flip/flopping on this subject during the relationship. My drinking mind will allow things that my sober mind would never do. I have lots of work to do. Have a great week team!",Alcoholism
"Been sober since 1 Jan this year, only had bad cravings a handful of times and I?m confused if this is normal? I didn?t get into any huge trouble from drinking, my blood levels were kinda fucked though, but nothing the GP said wouldn?t clear up with 3 months sober. Like, 3 months ago I would just be drunk from the second I woke up until the second I passed out at night, and probably the entire time I was asleep. And I?d make all the usual excuses, the plans to moderate and take days off that would never pan out. Probably 25-30 standards drinks a day, as a 27 year old woman.

I guess, has anyone else had this experience of giving up and then almost being like ?oh well maybe I didn?t need it that much anyway?? I don?t feel full of beans and haven?t lost weight, but now I?m starting to doubt if I am an alcoholic or if I just gravitate to being obsessive with whatever is easiest.

Well I have a friend/coworker, we'll call him Joe, and he's been pretty supportive of my journey so far.

I?m calling the place that I use to go to for therapy on my lunch break. I was better when I was there even though I was lying to him about the amount that I drank. He had to have known anyways; one of the last times I went, I was still drunk from the night before and I am sure I stunk of scotch.

I don?t know why this time is different. I?ve been in the same cycle for almost ten years but this is the first time I?ve actually? wanted to stop. I?ve quit before; a week there, a month there, but I always knew I was going to drink again. This time, I just don?t want to anymore. My kids are young (Jesus, I didn?t even take them to preschool yesterday because I wanted to drink and I knew I?d have to pick them up.), my wife loves me (although I can tell she hates how much I drink.

I will freely admit two things though: I've woken up REALLLLLLLY wanting a beer. My mind is trying to justify it in all kinds of ways (I can slip up once, get back on track tomorrow/I deserve a treat for progress). I refuse to give up to these cravings today, I'm gonna take it hour by hour. But they're there and it's difficult. I'm also kinda...scared at experiencing life without alcohol?

Now I feel so much better physically and mentally and, importantly, I have additional ""worthy calories"" at my disposal to be savoured during my continued dedication to gluttony.

I'm all ears if anyone wants any tactics or advice - I'd be lying if I said it was easy but I can say with confidence that it gets easier every day.

It's tough but totally worth it. Also, drunk me could be a bit of a dick...",Alcoholism
"4 months sober now. I?m alone in a hotel a state away from anyone I know and there?s a bar here and happy hour is soon and I?m lonely and depressed and want to drink. Bam, that?s all of it. I guess I?ll just curl up in bed and watch TV. I wouldn?t want to drive the 8 hours I need to tomorrow if I drank tonight.

I?ve kept hidden liquor and lied about not drinking. I?ve had things happen to me that wouldn?t have happened if I hadn?t blacked out. Ive tried to quit many times but have only gone one month without drinking before giving up. I think I?m finally ready to commit. I don?t want to drink. I don?t want to be the awful person I turn into. I gain nothing from drinking and I?m aware but it?s truly so hard to stop.

"I woke up this morning, knowing I will not drink today. I must say, I have no urge to drink but have been eating a lot of random things and drinking soda. I?m 32, and as of 3 days ago, I would do 2 bottles of white wine between the hours of 1pm-9pm. This only started when the whole work from home thing got introduced. Pre-COVID it was a bottle a day after work when I got home from the office around 7pm.

I still have two contract gigs I work on 7 days a week and always out perform anyone on the team.

Now I want to quit alcohol, for my health and to save money. I was spending $34 a day on 2 bottles and around $40 a day on two cigars while I work.

Here?s the hard part, I need a substitute to look forward to after work to keep this non-drinking streak.

My cousin and his wife who are around my age barely ever drink, but they smoke A LOT of weed.

I asked her specifically not to read it because that happened in my last relationship which was extremely toxic. I don't know how to feel.

"After drinking for 30 years (A few here and there at first and worked my way up to daily) Now finally noticing the less I drank the quicker I was getting intoxicated. This is where this quote comes in ? first the man takes a drink; then the drink takes a drink; then the drink takes a man?.

The first few days were horrible, the depression anxiety sweating self-loathing & migraines etc.

Finally on Day five I started to turn the corner. To wake up sober and watch the sunrise with a nice hot cup of coffee and to leave all the horrific first things in the morning like looking at my phone (Who did I call, text or buy something) or what did I do at home (hiding bottles) plus the anxiety self-loathing and depression behind.

"So far I have always drank myself to sleep, even on work days. I would be slightly hungover in the morning, but not sleepy.

Now that I don?t drink any more, I have terrible sleep quality. I know I sleep, but to me it feels like I?m awake all night, just twisting and turning and then it is morning. I never feel rested, all day I feel extremely tired and then the same happens at night.

I have tried melatonin and some sleeping pills. I will sleep better, but only until they wear off at 3-4 am and then I wake up and can?t fall asleep again. That makes me even more tired in the morning. If I take another pill at 3 - 4 it?s almost impossible to wake up in the morning and the whole day I?m in a daze.

"I mentioned in today's daily check-in about the shitty sleep I had the night before (due to inconsiderate neighbors) and had to face a rough and vigorous day at work. I felt pissed off and upset, but committed to not drinking just for today.

I got my ass out of bed and went on a legitimate power walk, crying every step of the way, but managed to make it through the morning. After checking in at work, I went to the gym and burned off the remaining pent-up energy.

I'm pleased to say that I successfully completed today's difficult work task, and I didn't fucking drink. Hell yeah. Another sober day in the books, SD.

I?m not seeking medical advice. Just looking for comfort. I?m very active and have a great diet. But these red bumps I get on my face and chest when I drink have scared me. I?m on day 2. I?m worried I have cirrhosis. I think that is worst case scenario. I have no other symptoms. No pain, no shakes, or nothing else. It?s just I get these really bad patches of red skin.

It?s legit a full-day affair and I end up saying ?I can?t live like this? and giving in. The only thing that temporarily snaps my brain out of it is smoking weed, but once the high wears off the craving comes back.

"I?m on day nine of not drinking and I haven?t had any liver soreness for about two days. No withdrawal symptoms or itchiness either. Insanely happy about this because I really thought that when I woke up on day 1 with all those withdrawal symptoms, significant liver pain, and insane itchiness that this was really the end. Prayed to everyone that might listen that I wouldn?t drink ever again if they let me live.

I?m going to the doctors later this month but I?m just so fucking happy that it?s super unlikely to be anything like cirrhosis or hepatitis, especially after my CA habits this past year.

"I?ve been sober 253 days. That?s definitely the most since I started drinking. I?m so happy and proud of myself.

I?m also getting really honest and realizing how much of a problem I had. I justified my drinking, found loopholes in the surveys (?Do you find you can?t stop drinking after you start?? Well of course not, I planned to drink all night!), hid my drinking, and functioned pretty well. I quit for 90 days (which stretched around 100) to ?take a break and reset,? then started drinking occasionally?then frequently?then daily. Again.

After one embarrassing night and a string of hangovers, I quit. I said I was quitting for a year, but I meant for good.

The thing is, I?m realizing that I am reluctant to say I?m done for good or admit how serious my drinking was?because that closes the door forever. Then if I drink again it?s a relapse, not just the end of my little experiment.

I have no desire to drink and can?t really imagine why I would, but now that I admit to myself I had a serious drinking problem for years and finally got sober?I?m scared to fuck it up. On the one hand I want to tell my close friends/family how accomplished I feel, on the other then if I do slip I?ll feel so exposed.",Alcoholism
I hit another milestone today. It?s my day 50. I can?t believe it. This sub has literally changed my life. I went from drinking 6-10 beers every day during the week and binge drinking on weekends. To 50 days with no Alcohol. Now I have been focusing on my health and am down 15lbs my stomach is not bloated and actually looks flat and muscular instead of bloated and full of Cellulite. My wife looks at me different and my children love me more than ever. My daughter (5yo) told me she likes me not drinking because ?I don?t fight with Mommy anymore? ?? My health is finally heading in the right direction with my blood pressure being normal for the first time in decades. I have rediscovered my love for mountain biking and even started a clothing brand (@azmtbco) around my hobby.

"I have a drinking problem and my financial life is in ruin, my health is a disaster, I?m completely losing my standing in society, my family is pushing away from me, and I?ve ruined a lot of great relationships with beautiful people. I?ve permanently ruined all sorts of chances at my greatest life goals and desires.

I don?t know if I drink quite heavily enough to get withdrawals, or have for long enough. Or, if I will, I don?t know whether or not they?ll be dangerous. Admittedly, I know nothing of what it takes to be at that point. I?m going to talk to my doctor tomorrow, and I hope he can shed some light on that.

If I have to go to a detox and/or rehab, I think I?ll lose my job and quickly wind up homeless - which I?m right on the cusp of anyways, because I spend all my money on alcohol and drugs - and I can?t take any time off from work. I?m already on the chopping block there for showing up drunk/hungover, and calling out/going home early a lot.

So I?m kind of hoping I can do this without detox/rehab. I know you can?t give me advice regarding that on this subreddit, and I?m not sure if there?s one where I could get it. I?m just venting the situation here.

I?m tired of drinking being the highlight of my day. And I?m tired of drinking ruining my life, mood, overall happiness, success in life, physical and mental health, relationships, and everything. Support in my life is very, very slim. A couple friends at most. And then about 20-30 people who actively make the problem way, way worse lol.

I want to get 100% sober and clean, that?s all I know. I want to heal, and fix my life and be a better version of myself. And I know why. I just hope that?s enough to survive on. And when that other guy shows up who prefers to drink? I hope I can consistently out maneuver him with self-understanding and an awareness of the situation. But that scares me, because consistency ain?t my strong suit. I just wish I could snap my fingers and be sober and fixing my life. But I know there is a LOT of painful hell I need to walk through to get to that point. And that scares me. I hope I?m ready for whatever it is.",Alcoholism
I live in a uni dorm with 6 others. I've been secretly drinking from the moment I woke up so I can work up the courage to leave my room and actually socialise and have fun. At the end of the day it usually got to around 600-700ml of straight vodka as I'd sneak back into my room to take a few swigs. For the past few months I've been heavily reliant on it to even cope. Waking up most mornings not knowing the tail end of the night prior with severe shakes and nausea is an awful feeling as well as having built up quite a reputation of being especially outgoing even though I struggle with bad social anxiety. I decided to fake having coronavirus so I could self isolate in my room in an attempt to detox. I stocked up on food and liquids and now I'm on day 4 moving onto day 5. Things are starting to clear up a bit. My shakes are still there and I'm still very anxious especially to loud noises but I've found getting some natural sugar in me and some hearty food helps a lot.

The past few months have been the worst it?s ever been, going hand in hand with some really difficult mental health struggles. After losing count of how many attempts at sobriety I?ve failed, I finally scared myself into committing to this again. 3 days ago, after heavily binge drinking and feeling physically awful, I looked up some of my symptoms out of curiosity. Turns out many of them indicate possible internal bleeding, liver damage, or at the very least, prolonged damage to my insides (given that I already have GERD and many other things of the sort).

I have a doctors appointment in a few days to either ease my possible hypochondria or begin treating whatever damage I have done to myself.

As I?m sure many of us know, even the possibility of irreversible damage might not be enough to stop us from drinking, but I?m clutching onto this wake up call with all I?ve got.

" Just wanted to take a minute to celebrate my success this far! In the early days of my sobriety, I really didn't know if I would make it to one year.

The numbness. That was my comfort zone. I was terrified to face my sober self.

"I drank for 36 years. Other than the weekend-warrior dorm-room drinking in college, and a 4 year stint of heavy drinking when I thought I was the king of the world, I spent most of that time just being a 2 beers a night kind of person...up until this pandemic shut-in. Now, I might have missed a half dozen days of work due to alcohol in that 36 years, NEVER drove drunk, and the last time I puked from drinking was about 8 years ago (crazy party)....so I never really felt like I had a problem until this last December when I opened my eyes and realized I was up to 5-7 drinks a night (hard-A and beer) and realized that was solid for about the last year; increasing since the pandemic started, I figure. So, for the sake of my gizzard, I decided to stop drinking (especially for no reason/alone). 90% of the time I was just on the computer and drinking alone. So, I found some (really crappy) NA beers and got one to stick so stopped entirely for January of this year, and have had 3 drinks in February so far. I did not really read up or learn much about the whats and whys and expectations of quitting, but I can say this. My brain is on fire. Not pain, but it is racing 19 hours a day. I think the last 36 years I have had ""control rods"" in the form of alcohol keeping it at bay...but now I have a conundrum. I like how my thinking has opened up to a broad-band type of awareness. I can multitask, I can remember stuff better, and I can get things done instead of putting them off. But...I can not shut it off. My 5.5 hours of sleep went to about 4 now (I have learned I have to nap or sleep long weekends if I can). I wonder if that is why I started drinking in the first place, because my childhood was a blur and my school was boring (easy), and I was hyper and such. There is probably an acronym that would be applied to me if I were a kid today. When I turned 19ish I started drinking and I can only think that maybe it helped calm me and I liked it?

"Have not been able to kick the habit of daily drinking (6-8 a day, sometimes more) for more than 2 years. Haven't gotten more than a day, even with a trip to the emergency room caused by an alcohol-induced health scare

I hit rock bottom by maxing out my two credit cards. I can't afford to drink anymore. I've always wanted to stop (to lose weight, to not hate my body, to save money, to not feel like garbage every day) but there was always an excuse. Now I literally cannot afford it, so I have to make a change.

I found a small solace: CBD drinks have given me all the good parts of alcohol (releasing me from my anxiety, allowing me to relax and focus and be calm) without all the negatives.

Day 1, I had chills and shakes, was crippled with anxiety, my anger was overwhelming and every little thing made me irritable.

Day 2, the shakes continued and the chills were still there. Still angry at every little thing. CBD helped the anxiety in the evening at least, but it took me hours to fall asleep

Day 3, today, the anxiety is still there as always, but I feel more refreshed and present/mindful. The shakes and chills are frustrating but manageable. Focusing on one day at a time is helping.

"I'm going to a professional conference this week. This will be my first time back to an in person conference since the pandemic started. As always, I know there will be a lot of alcohol, on top of all my colleagues eager to go share some spirits because it's our first in person event in years.

"I work from home, and I recently got into the habit of getting a grocery order delivered just so I can have a six pack of beer brought to my house. I don't have to drive anywhere, or be subjected to the bar scene. I'm also an introvert, so drinking alone at home is perfectly comfortable for me. It's so easy.

Thought about doing that today since my partner is out of town. As someone else commented recently, I need to honor myself and avoid saying ""fuck it"" solely because I know it's easy to get away with. I really need to quit with my self sabotaging tendencies.",Alcoholism

"12 days sober, super proud, and IWNDWYT! Great news: alcohol-induced, daily anxiety is pretty much gone and my cravings for alcohol have reduced a bit. Buuuuut there have been some really annoying downsides..

Lots of fatigue and huge lack of focus. It?s so, so hard to wake up in the morning after getting a full night of sleep (I feel soooo tired - would sleep 12 hours daily if I could afford to), and the lack of focus makes it difficult to get work done (I work from home which also makes it harder to focus/not drink sometimes).

"For the last 8 birthdays I have celebrated by blacking out on the 20th to pregame for blacking out on the 21st for my birthday. I didn't feel any stress or anxiety about the future for nearly a decade because I had a cure in the form of alcohol but what ended up happening over the years was I just stopped caring about anything beyond getting home getting drunk repeat. I just survived life, I didn't plan for anything good or bad as long as I had enough money to get my fix and a bed to sleep in I was okay.

This year, I'm sober and have been sober 140 of the last 154 days and my life is getting better day by day week by week. I'm beginning to care about things again. I care about my friends and family more deeply than I have in a decade, I care about my future so much that I re-enrolled in school to finish my degree that I couldn't complete when I was drinking heavily. I have a savings plan to finally get myself out of stupid debts and build a nest egg so I'm not flying by the seat of my pants. I see my friends settling down and building families and I now want that again so I'm trying to seriously date again. I had a few casual type relationships during the past decade but honestly I cared more about getting drunk than turning them into something real.

I have goals and dreams again and the thought that I might not achieve them brings me great anxiety but I've realized that fear of the future is why I numbed myself for years and hiding from the fear didn't get me anything. I'm scared shitless but it's such a weird amazing type of scared, my future is mine again and if I take it day by day and don't get too far ahead of myself it can be mine until eternity. This might make no sense to anyone else but I'm glad I'm scared again.",Alcoholism

"longer version: almost 6 months in (yay!!!!) and i have my first girlfriend in 10 years (first meaningful, supportive and loving relationship of my life)... I've heard the term ""gifts of sobriety"" and i feel like i'm receiving them daily. however, I'm writing to share a hiccup with the community for feedback:

my gf drinks 1-3 drinks max maybe once a week, she can easily drink one beer and be done with it. when i'm with my friends i never feel tempted or even like i'm missing out when they drink but with her it's different. i feel anger towards her that she can drink so easily and responsibly. I've had to work hard to believe that alcohol is not a comfort support, or happiness, yet i see her waltzing to the hot tub with a beer in her hand, wondering why she wants to drink at all. on one hand i'm angry she drinks around me because her drinking makes me think she's not on my team. i also ask myself what is the moment missing that alcohol would fill for her (she says nothing, I've asked his question). i'm also jealous that she can drink so lightly without bother, and i can't. on the other hand, i don't care if ANYONE around me drinks, except her. I've been to bachelor parties, work trips to vegas, met new friends all unphased yet she goes to the hot tub with beer and i'm sideways. we've talked about this a little bit but i can't help but put her in a separate bucket from my friends, which i believe is unfair to her (what's her drinking have to do with me?).

this leads me to believe my discomfort with her drinking has more to do with me than her. i used to drink a lot during relationships because they were so uncomfortable for me (anxious + avoidant attachment style). in general, i feel so much feel better, much more comfortable in my skin, i wonder if the desire to drink around her is to numb the intimacy or to put some distance between us and nothing to do with her actual drinking. my solution will be to continue to grow close to her emotionally despite the discomfort and despite the occasional craving, in the hopes the craving will subside one day. i also plan to discuss this a bit more with her if it seems appropriate and i will absolutely discuss this with my therapist. if i'm dangerously close to crossing a line I'll also call a friend, post here, etc but that's not a worry, at all. the worry is how intimacy creates cravings.",Alcoholism
"I have been dry for ten days. This is the longest I have gone since December 2021, when I also went ten days. Before this, my nine-day streak tied a streak from last September. If I make it through tomorrow, the 11 day streak will be my longest since a 14 day streak in September 2020. And ultimately I hope to break my longest streak, 73 days back in March-May 2020.

I?ve been tracking my drinking since 2014 and I?m obsessed with streaks. It gives me something to shoot for, a little bit of extra motivation when the day gets late and the brain tries to talk me into one drink.",Alcoholism
"I've pretty much been drinking since i was a kid, like 12 or 13. I'd basically say Ive stayed on a steady binge since 16 or 17, at least 4-5 drinks a night with some breaks in between. I'm moderately successful, job stress in the restaurant industry always keeps me running back for a brew... Or 6 or 7.

I sobered up for my ex-wife like 10 years back. Was the most productive I ever was in my life for that period, and essentially put myself on easy street. If I keep current pace I'll be able to retire at 40, not in my plans really though. Because I own property and restaurants, I can't really ""hit bottom"" (I suppose I could, but it would be a drastic stretch for a steady alcoholic) I just maintain at like a 6 pack of high alcohol content beer and maybe one or two shots a night.

I've gained a lot of weight back since sobriety, but I'm not obese by any stretch. Went from like 5% body fat to like 15%. I've lost interest in most everything but social or drinking alone and gaming. I'm still very successful in my industry and am doing better than my competitors in terms of (the big killer right now) employee retention and sales.

I'd like to stop drinking daily to get back into my size 30 pants and just to have some positivity towards life, but I can't seem to find the motivation. After therapy for a couple years and different diagnoses, I guess I'm depressed and have high levels of anxiety coupled with adhd, but I don't really like labels. I've always felt the tension from my anxiety and ""adhd"" have been some of the things that made me successful in the quick service food industry.

I guess I'd just like to be able to get back to the place I was, waking up early, working out before work, killing the game at the restaurant, and generally feeling happy.

Yet every day, I find myself back at the convenience store, buying the same six pack, going home to my loving girlfriend and my dogs, drinking all night, feeling hopeless in the morning. Idk why, but I need to break the cycle booze has on my mental health, although I've managed it from making me seriously in a bad spot.

Idk. Sorry for the rant. I guess I'm hoping some can relate. I feel numb to the world and like I'm just going through the motions of life. I can't really complain because I've built myself up to be well off, but I just feel generally unhappy and booze is always the solace at the end of the day.",Alcoholism
Feels like a major milestone! When I started my journey i thought it was a miracle for me to get 3 days sober. Today I am helping others and living my life one day at a time and loving my sober lifestyle. If u are just starting out just take it one breath one step and one moment at a time.

I?m so tired of living like this. I tried to stop drinking twice before, but just end up falling back into it and every single time I seem to spiral harder. If I don?t stop this shit will end up being the end of me.

I?ve been an awful fianc to my partner. I?m about to be a first time aunt this year and this isn?t the type of aunt I want to be. This isn?t the type of wife I want to be. I also don?t want to be the daughter that pretends she has her drinking under control to not worry her parents.",Alcoholism

"fter a particularly bad night, I set a goal of 100 days alcohol free. Truthfully, I didn?t think I would make it. After two months of doing the hard work of being sober, I was feeling pretty crappy.

My husband, who joined me for the 100-day challenge, saw improved sleep, weight loss, and increased energy after just a few weeks. I was frustrated and disappointed. But I read many of your posts saying to JUST KEEP GOING one day at a time, and so I did. And right about the 100-day mark, things started to improve. My anxiety is reduced, my energy is better, and I actually lost a few pounds.

First event, one of my best friends' birthdays was on the 16th. A lot of my friend group is remote, so we were going to play games online. Cool.

Well, they know about my drinking problem, so dumb ass me was like, OK, I can have a few shooters and they won't know. Well as we all know, we can't control or pace ourselves.

"For about 5 years, I have been listening to sober podcasts, reading about getting sober, going to the occasional meeting, dipping my toes into various online groups that cost money. I have had a week here, a few weeks there, alcohol free. Some of the groups/podcasts I really enjoyed and learned from..Some, I really did not like or benefit from.

One valuable lesson for me was, even if I was only sober for a period, and went back to drinking, it doesn't mean it negates what I learned during that sober period. Anyway, this time around its been much easier to not drink, and I believe its because of all the work I put into it previously.

I am trying not to stress about ""what if I drink?"" in the future and just focusing on the moment. I mean...what if I do drink? Then I will stop again.",Alcoholism

"Just one more cautionary tale for those of us who are sure we're different and can be cured of drinking with a year or more of not drinking. I hate how common I feel right now, but I'm looking forward to being one of the uncommon non-drinkers who just put it away for good and live my best life.
I quit drinking back in August 2020. During the early phases of the pandemic my drinking was becoming something 'other-worldly'. There was nothing to do. I worked from home, everyone was always home, and I didn't see any friends. I'd start drinking around 7PM, go until about 1 or 2AM, get up and go to work online, lather, rinse, repeat every day. Weekends I could drink until 4AM.

I had been a 'problem drinker' since my sophomore year in college back in the 90s and I always knew I was just like my dad, uncles, aunts, etc. who all were alcoholics. But in August 2020 I finally decided to put it away ""for at least a year"" to clean up my life a bit.

It was a great year. SO many benefits, including doubling my income, being offered multiple jobs, wonderful bonding with my family, and feeling physically healthy all the time. The quality of sleep alone... *chefs kiss*

In October 2021, my father-in-law, who was very close to us, died in my arms from a pulmonary edema. A neighbor and I brought him back to life with CPR and he was alive and aware at the ER, but the trauma was too much and he passed a few days later. It was...devastating.

He and I had been drinking buddies for 20 years. We'd sit on the back porch and he'd complain about his wife's nagging, and he'd listen intently to my complaints about my industry or business partners. Our bond was a good one and he was such a great father figure for me (my father passed when I was 10). He was also an alcoholic who definitely missed drinking with me when I quit.

The day he passed, I poured a drink for him and one for me. And then I drank mine.

I decided that night that I could drink normally, and would occasionally have a drink then on. I KNEW I'd wind up drinking heavily again. So it shouldn't come as any surprise to you (nor to me) that that's exactly what happened.

This week I was on a business trip and I drank 5 nights in a row, heavily every night. I've been trying to lose a little weight and the #1 item on my calorie count for the past 30 days is alcohol - making up more than 14% of my total calorie count.

I've been irritable, sleeping poorly, mentally foggy, anxious, depressed, unhappy, and ashamed every day I have drank since starting again. I regret that drink, and I regret throwing away a year or more of sobriety.

I have SO MANY REASONS to not drink. I have a fatty liver. I have high cholesterol. I am overweight by at least 40 pounds. I can't workout the morning after drinking. I am in a high risk category that suggests I can't drink anymore. And yet I'm convincing myself I can drink normally. WHY DRINK AT ALL? I need to get healthy! I want to stay connected to my family! I want to go back to where I was in 2021 without the alcohol dominating my day-to-day life.

So let this be the last Day One and the first day where I am 100% firmly committed to being my best self, which is the version that doesn't drink.

I can only speak for myself when I say that I CANNOT HAVE JUST ONE DRINK no matter how long it's been. But I'm not the only one who's tried and regretted it. Let my story be a cautionary tale in the pile of reasons to never start again.",Alcoholism

I'll keep up a daily immune defence supplement, vitamin d and liver detox supplement.

"You may have heard this before, but this is one of the ""secrets"" to long-term sobriety. I have seen so many people relapse after many months, because they focus on quitting drugs and alcohol, and not enough focus on really changing as a person. Things like managing anger and stress. You're going to have a bad time in sobriety. We're going to need to get through those tough times without falling back into drugs and alcohol to cope. I'm not kidding, 75% at least, relapse before hitting 1 year. There are real stats out there, but I just pulled that one out of my ass. Even really ""happy"" sober people who seem to have it together. Usually it's one of these two situations: Overconfidence after some solid sober time, or giving up due to a lack of magical happiness manifesting from nowhere. Sobriety doesn't magically fix things.

He was standing there all awkwardly with some nerdy looking can with a straw looking out of place. Get that bottle in his hand though, now he's fitting and laughing along with everyone else! It's like he had to have something that still represents booze even though it's non-alcoholic.

I was never someone who was drinking nonstop, 7 days a week. I wouldn't drive drunk. I didn't lose jobs. I didn't end up in jail or the hospital.

But that's the thing - I'm 31 and have drank heavily since age 15. My mom, dad, and sister are all alcoholics. My best friends are drunks. My grandpa passed away from it. And every time I drank, I drank way more than I intended, and I wasn't willing to wait for one of those terrible things to happen to snap me out of it.

On a basic level, it's hard being around problematic drinking (especially family) cuz it's triggering and just generally likely to end in an upset. But watching it is also just brutal. Particularly sad with family... Because I know their upbringing, baggage, hurt, justifications, anxieties, demons, insecurities because we grew up together. But because we're also so different, it's hard to know what to do.

Sad seeing that far away look in their eye.

I've got some unresolved issues which I need to work through, and I think that has been a driving factor pushing me to drink excessively. After a big night out, I then feel like crap physically, and also a sense of anxiety that I might have said and done stupid things the previous night.",Alcoholism
"I?m starting day 1 today. I go on 5-7 day sobriety streaks, sometimes even longer, then I?ll have a few drinks and feel like absolute shit the next day. I don?t feel like I even drank much last night but my headache says otherwise. Just another reason for me to cut this shit out.

I?m a nursing student who needs to be on my A game and today is a study day for me. Studying while hungover is not going to be fun, but that?s the price I have to pay.",Alcoholism
"My daughter wanted to go over her aunts today and my sister agreed. I haven?t been away from toddler in about 2 weeks. I dropped her off and thought- well this would be the perfect opportunity to drink. If there is any.

But I didn?t! I came home and cleaned my house so I can start the week off on the right foot. Glad I made that decision!",Alcoholism
"I have struggled with my drinking for a long time. Started drinking at a young age and since then have used it as a crutch for dealing with my emotions. I have done really dumb shit, I have hurt people I care about, and, probably worst of all, I have learned to hide it. I?m writing this hungover and embarrassed.

In the past I would always say I?m ready to take a break from drinking, but today I am ready to remove it from my life for the rest of my life. I want to rely on healthy outlets for when I get frustrated, hurt or stressed.",Alcoholism
"I was talking with my husband the other day about how I truly don?t want alcohol to be a part of my life anymore, but I admitted that it?s too overwhelming to say and think about the fact that I?ll never, ever drink again.

In fact, it makes me a little sad. But why? I?ve already established that drinking adds nothing good to my life, only takes. I love my life and who I am when I?m sober. Rationally, I know I?m not missing out on anything and not drinking anymore is NOT a loss?but it still feels like it is, at least a little bit.",Alcoholism
"I say ?really committed? because I?ve had a lot of off and on for the past few months & a lot of failures. I?m on a 7 day streak right now. I?ve really set my intentionality for get sober in hopes that it sticks this time.

Any ways, I went out with my friends for a late dinner at a tapas & wine bar and didn?t drink at all. Im very proud of myself & it was so nice waking up refreshed this morning. & it was nice having a bill that was at a minimum $40 less than everyone else?s at our table. I had fun and feel refreshed today instead of my usual day of Sunday scaries",Alcoholism
Or at least it would have been. I was doing so well and was so proud of myself. Then I went to the mall with a friend and he came back to my house for drinks. Today I feel horrible. Woke up with a major headache and just a general feeling of panic and anxiety. All I can do from here is try again. Thank you all for the support,Alcoholism
"A couple of days ago, the wheels came off. I hurt the people that I love. My daughter said ?my Dad is a drunk?.

It?s been a while since anything like this has happened, but I know that it can?t happen. I understand what my priorities are. Drink has taken enough from me. I want to live.

A close friend of mine offered to get me there and thankfully I said yes. She may have saved my life. I will be going back next Sunday.",Alcoholism
"Remember that saying ""one is too much and 1000 is not enough?""

Yeah. Found that out. Again. It's morning and I'm awake with a hangover and anxiety after getting maybe three hours of sleep last night. I sent someone some concerning emails last night and I'm dreading the fall out from that. And I'm lying to my SO and friends again. I can't seem to get off the merry-go-round.",Alcoholism
"I?m starting over again from day 0 tomorrow. I give myself permission to eat whatever I want to help discourage myself from drinking.

I?ve gotten some snacks to try to encourage myself to be successful, including single serve ice cream, dried fruit, dark chocolate bars, and yogurt. Do you have any favorites that have helped stave off cravings?",Alcoholism
"Went to a friend?s 40th last night with my cooler of NA beers. There was a copious amount of liquor and being surrounded by former drinking company was hard, but I didn?t drink!

I did have a THC snickerdoodle, though, and the way it made me feel last night and this morning is not worth the not feeling in control. I actually had to cancel a scheduled obligation this morning because I felt so lightheaded and out of it.

Being a control freak often makes my anxiety worse, but in this case, it may just save me when it comes to being cognizant and straying with any vices",Alcoholism
"I was doing a HIIT workout on my (NEW) exercise bike yesterday, not because I'm committed to fitness or anything, but a HIIT routine is so much more intensive, and therefore requires far less time, when the damn crank axle came loose and started sliding side to side.

Normally this is the type of setback that leads me to justifying a drink, but I literally can't do that anymore. Not even if I wanted to, if you catch my meaning. Anyway, just wanted to say that.",Alcoholism
"I don't want to come off as bragging but I didn't even know I passed 100 days. I can't say everything has been smooth though. I had so many problems pop up at work and home, family health issues you name it. Relapsing would of been icing on a poo flavored cake.

It is crazy to think I had my first drunk experience when I was 15 I quit drinking when I was 30. Half my life I have been drinking. That is just nuts. The next 15 will be much healthier.",Alcoholism
"I ordered the fries with my water while everyone else had their drink. I enjoyed the shit out of them and didn't give myself grief about the calories - knowing I saved so many by not drinking.

I drove home, sober, and had a great rest of the evening. If I had been drinking, I probably wouldn't have even ordered the fries, gone home on an empty stomach, drank more and passed out without brushing my teeth or putting my stuff away.

Instead, the house is tidy, my teeth are brushed and I'm going to read my book.

Order the fries, do whatever you need to do, just don't drink!",Alcoholism
"I want to scream... maybe that would help actually.

I am a very grown adult that moved in with my parents pre pandemic and ending up staying.. during that time I found out that I have been living with undiagnosed autism.

That changed everything and I do not know when I will be moving out now, or if I will ever really feel independent again. When I did live on my own it was pure hell, but at least I had the space I needed from other humans.

I feel like I have zero space to myself here, which is just not true. I have wonderful parents that are very understanding- I am so grateful for them. It's the autism that makes living with others almost unbearable. It's really hard to describe unless you have a brain like this and I wish I wasn't like this.",Alcoholism
"I haven?t drank in 14 months and last night I went out with my sister in laws and they both had one margarita. I haven?t seen them both in a long time and they both have their shit together and have good jobs. I?m a married stay at home mom who has anxiety. I have a hard time opening up and socializing. The whole night was awkward for me. We got into some deep conversations and I tell them my whole horrible upbringing. Why? I guess because I was trying to help them understand why I?m a fidgety, awkward, anxiety ridden pos. I used to blame alcohol on the reasons why I say dumb shit but I didn?t even drink. I?m not very close with them and I feel like I shouldn?t have opened up so much. I need to go on medication for my anxiety but every pill out there makes you gain a shit ton of weight. I honestly feel hangxiety today but I didn?t even drink. Is this all In my head? Am I overreacting? I just want to escape my crippling anxiety. Why can?t I just be normal??",Alcoholism
"Since I was 13 I?ve been drinking regularly. It isn?t daily but more excessive drinking at the weekends for social reasons. Lately I?ve been drinking that much I?ve been losing my personal items and saying things that have destroyed friendships. I actually can?t live this way, has anyone been through this? I?m 24 and I have particular issue with the things I?ve said drunk. It?s almost like I get possessed by something because I fully black out and never remember it either.",Alcoholism
"To give you some context, I am currently deployed overseas and my wife is back home in Alaska. She continues to endure me even after all I put her through. I definitely feel my drinking took more out of her than it did me. It wasn't until today that I truly understood the depths of her pain.

I quit drinking in December 2018 and since then have been focused on burying the man that alcohol made me. I have moved forward, achieving every personal and professional goal that I have ever desired. Every milestone I pass pushes the memory of my alcoholism further and further into the rearview. Every achievement is one more barrier between me and the bottle. I have developed a resiliency to life that does not depend on alcohol, and I know that I am safe from taking a drink, for now. I just feel better, you know? Happy, alive, ready to surmount any obstacle. I am OK.",Alcoholism
"Made it 25 days! Up until I went on an out of town roadtrip and the stress / vacation mode mindset took over. I drank every night that weekend and although I didn't get in any real serious trouble (except minor relationship arguments), the only thing I could think about was how great I felt during the days I wasn't drinking.

It's now been two weeks since that vacation and I haven't made it longer than two days without drinking since then. Can't let this cycle continue and take over, so I'm back and ready for change. So mainly this post is for my own accountability since this group helps me so much!

I heard someone (can't remember who) say in this group to think of your sobriety days as a high score. I really like that and I know this time I'm on track to set my highest score ever this year! Day 1 here we go.",Alcoholism
"I have to admit my life has improved in so many ways since I quit. Celebrated my one year sober on Tuesday! There are still tough moments though, especially earlier tonight. I'm allowing myself to experience my feelings, and wait for them to pass. Eating a Klondike bar in the meantime.",Alcoholism
"I want to thank you all for the kind words on my first (and only, across this entire site) post about going to yoga because I wasn?t hungover (finally) on a Saturday morning. In the two weeks since I?ve managed to keep up the not drinking with one terrible, glaring exception that throws into sharp relief why I need to stop. I?ll spare the details (I?m sure you?ve all heard it before) but it involved fighting with my partner, who is an absolute gem of a human. I can?t continue to fuck that up by wielding drunken weapons. So, again, I will continue to try very hard not to drink at all.",Alcoholism
"A few days ago I was scrolling in this thread, and saw someone ask about drinking dreams-why we have them and the anxiety of it all. I sat there for a minute and realized that I have never had one. A small little thought arose that kind of sounded like, ?watch me have one now.? Well, last night I did end up having one. However, I was not drinking. I was at my cabin back in high school and there was a bunch of kids who had stole alcohol out of my parents cabin. The adults were all searching rooms trying to find who may have their bottle stashed away somewhere, and my friend was panicking looking around our room, thinking someone may have hidden it in one of our drawers. I looked at her as she was crazily looking through everything and I said, ?it?s okay if someone hid it in here. We didn?t drink. It doesn?t matter.? I have a feeling my ?friend? was the old panicked me, and I was the current version of myself. That was kind of cool, and it sure felt that way too. Then a whole inception kind of thing took place-and I realized it was a dream",Alcoholism
"I've quit a bad 10 year long binge drinking habit, 18 year old cigarette habit and a 10 month old daily weed habit, all at once for around 50 days now and apart from 2 cigarettes which confirmed that smoking isn't worth it, I haven't had any slip ups. That problem is that I am absolutely bushed after work and can't really get anything much done, it's been my dream to start living my life instead of pissing it away, yet I'm really tired all the time and can get really irritable in the mornings. Can anyone advise what I can do to not feel so tired as coffee just makes me more antsy, I'm sick of snapping at people and having negative thoughts all the time. Whilst I am proud of myself and don't want to relapse, I am also having some pretty sad/dark thoughts and just want to get back to how i was before the drink became a habit and be able to take enjoyment from simple things....",Alcoholism
"Had friends over for dinner. They all had a fair bit to drink and I?m sure are waking up this morning feeling groggy and tired. I drank ice tea and slept like a baby.

Oh and I enjoyed the conversations and evening just as much if not more and could focus on being a good host rather than guzzling down more and more wine.

I feel rested and am going to cuddle my kids as soon as they wake up. Going to go to the gym today (no hangover or lack of energy keeping me home). Have some family coming over and I?ll stick to tea.",Alcoholism
"Day 167 ? solid
A day spent resting, doing some house work, wasting some hours on the Internet, a few workouts, a dinner out, and watching a bunch of cartoons before a solid 8 hour sleep. ?Slept in? until 7 am. It?s gonna be another good one.",Alcoholism
Officially 60 days sober today! Going to go get my coin here in a couple hours but I'm so happy with myself I wanted to share with you all now. Here's to another 60 but I will start with today.,Alcoholism
"I have read other posts like this here, and last night it was my turn. I have eaten a lot while watching a movie, and I think I got food poisoning. Horrible night and tough morning.

I'm super tired, dizzy, dehydrated, still nauseous and weak. I had many plans and chores for today, but my body needs to rest and recover.

Of course it reminds me of how bad it is to wake hangover. Even when they're milder than this symptoms. It really makes me treasure even more my sober sundays.",Alcoholism
"Just wondering what has worked for you in getting to sleep in the early days?

I'm trying a new podcast tonight (Sleep With Me), and I've taken two herbal sleeping remedies (with Valerian and passionflower), but I'm finding it hard to sleep. I have anxiety and recently finished an abusive relationship, so I have an unending reel of that in my head when I'm trying to sleep.

I need anything BUT alcohol to get me to sleep!",Alcoholism
"Still anxious and wee bit restless , hopefully sleep shld come tonite , trudging on IWNDWYT?.. and will keep you in my prayers ?.. thanks for the support?.

"Has anyone felt like they?re on a train they can?t control and are along for the ride? I felt that way this week, and it?s terrifying, so I?m stopping. I want control again, before something actually bad happens beyond embarrassment and feeling awful.",Alcoholism
"I?ve been going back and forth trying not to drink since a few months, lockdown has made it worse but it also made me realise that I have a problem when my partner found me passed out on the ground one morning.

I?ve been trying aa and it was good but after a while I thought I didn?t need it because mindful meditation did a similar job for me. But life happened and anxiety builds up, that?s when I forget to do my routines and it just becomes a shit show.

Unfortunately, my longest streak of not drinking was around 12 days, lately it?s been 4-5 days.

I want to really try harder and want to do aa every morning but I seem to forget, how do you guys do it, any tips?",Alcoholism
"I woke up this morning feeling anxious, and I used to simply take a shot or two to calm my nerves. Now that that is not an option, does anybody have any tips for dealing with this without picking up a bottle? Much appreciated.",Alcoholism
"Played a show at a warehouse party last night sober. Not my first time but the first time since relapsing 10 months ago. I have a song in my set about a friend of mine who died from benzos and his partner who was with him at the time came and saw us play, was an incredibly weird and uncomfortable experience. The promoter was very sweet and put some Heineken zero in our drinks rider but I still had to run away almost instantly. Like I wanted nothing more than to get a bag of cans, bag of coke and party all night but instead I got a cab home, a kebab and watched shit tv. Felt weird and lonely at the time but I?ve just got up, not hungover, on Sunday morning and I?m so thankful for it.",Alcoholism

"Alright got three weeks under my belt. Cravings are actually significantly improved as well as willpower. I still feel like epic crap though sleep issues, low energy and anxiety. So it seems that GABA gets real messed up with excessive drinking. Has anyone used a GABA supplement? Do they seem to help or would I just be paying for expensive pee?",Alcoholism
"That?s a rough estimate of how much alcohol I was drinking a week. A very conservative estimate, mind you. And that doesn?t include the 1am ?omg I?m so hungry? massive fast food doordash orders that came along with my drinking. Point being, I?m just finishing day 6, and I?m down 7 pounds. I?ve been between 220-225 pounds for the last 2/3 years, and between cutting out the alcohol and not having much of an appetite (also from cutting out the alcohol) I?m seeing a pretty drastic difference on the scale. I?m sure once my appetite comes back, some of these pounds are sure to come back, But for now, I?m seeing this as a nice little plus. And I?m sure in the long run, cutting out alcohol will lead to me being at a healthy weight for me, again.",Alcoholism
"Feels like everyone is drinking. GF is out hitting the bars with friend of hers. All my friends are drinking with friends or s/os.

"I?m 19 days in. Went out for dinner for the first time last night. Going out for dinner is something I?ve always enjoyed liquored up.

It felt weird ordering a coke zero while everyone else in the restaurant drank beer and wine.

I pushed through? had a great thai dinner, got home and watched a movie. It was a great night, even if the urges to order a beer were definitely very strong.",Alcoholism
"I feel as if none of the good things in my life are any good anymore. Just wanna trash it all. My life is too good for me to deserve living it. I almost miss the hell of drinking because it was something different from the mundane day to day. I'm bored with my totally awesome easy life without much struggle. I know, I'll make this harder on myself. Let's go get super drunk early in the evening, throw up in a bar bathroom, and barely remember it. Next day and I am numb. Numb to the emotions what got me here. Disappointed in myself for giving in to the desire to self-sabotage. Oh how the day after feels when I'm steeped in my own bs. I can lament about it or do something practical. But damn I'm pretty hungover.",Alcoholism
"My sleep has improved many times over since stopping drinking. I still have hard middle-of-the-night wake ups occasionally (the kind that last a couple hours), and they seem to correlate to evenings when I?ve had big sugary desserts not long before bed. It has never occurred to me that foods other than alcohol could ruin sleep. But the sugar thing seems real. Anyone else experience something similar?",Alcoholism
All I want to do is have a drink to silence my mind for a bit so I can pass out. Thought train barreling down the tracks and none of my usual methods are derailing it because it involves my kids feelings being ignored for others and I can't help them. I have a damn headache now.,Alcoholism

I have been using I am sober app? Now the countdown is going to start from zero again? I also feel like a zero?..",Alcoholism
"The last time I drank I got the dreaded alcohol poisoning, and was sicker than I ever thought was possible. Straight up throwing up for 48 hours unable to drink any sort of fluid. I finally decided to get my shit together.

This time feels right & I feel strong today. I am also am 36 days sober from weed, which is like a miracle for me. FYI no judgement towards week smokers, just something I have never had any control over.

I went out for breakfast at this diner with my husband today and it was so weird seeing the menu say ?On Monday?s start your day off right with a Bloody Mary half off?, it makes me shudder thinking about drinking. My body feels sick at the thought.",Alcoholism
"I'm ruining our relationship. I get drunk and get mad at him, cause arguments, be mean to him. I think I have a drinking problem. I drink too much, too often. I want so desperately to stop. I've tried before, many times. And failed. I feel a little tinge of jealousy when I hear about people who don't drink. I wish it could be me. I'm really ruining my health, hangovers last 3 days now, by which time I'm usually drunk again. So pretty much either drunk or hungover all the time. I need to stop. I want to stop. I've been drinking for 20 years now. It's time to stop.",Alcoholism
"Full disclosure: I have no intention of never drinking again. I'm 24yo and I never drink during the week. On the weekends, I drink with friends but I recently noticed that the fun I have isn't always worth the mental and physical repercussions. Two weeks ago I had a really fun time both on Friday and Saturday but I felt really bad for 3 days afterwards. So I decided not to drink the next weekend, and see how that would go. I managed and it felt so good that I decided not to drink this weekend either and tbh, I felt it was even easier than last weekend. I have so much more time for other things and I feel much better mentally.

I think this was a great ""experiment"" for me because it made me realize that I often link certain activities (a housewarming, going to a bar) to alcohol, whereas it doesn't need to be like that. I think this has really helped me to gain a new perspective and I think I'll go sober for a while longer ",Alcoholism
"Dad quit drinking a few years before I did. He took golf seriously before I did. My best friend limited his drinking on the course and came to play. The chemistry among us was like the trio from top gear/the grand tour. Lots of fun, I finally beat my dad, and I damn near beat my friend. Couldn't have done it if I was drinking like I used to. I even managed to win a few games of chess while enjoying a cigar with my neighbor after. And I won't be hungover tomorrow, so I can crush some boulders and hit the shooting range.

I don't remember having this great of a birthday weekend in a decade. Then again I can't remember any of my birthdays from my 20's. Life has its good times and its hard times, but not making it harder than it has to be seems to make it better than tolerable from time to time.",Alcoholism

Lol, no.

BUT (heh) I was only tired, not frantically craving alcohol, not desperately needing to get home and have a few drinks to sort myself out. So I was able to get him his meds with minimal (internal) whining about it and generally be a decent girlfriend instead of selfish drunk only focused on getting home to her poison.",Alcoholism
"Maybe there are other examples. But when giving up cigarettes, no one expects you to hang outside with smokers. Crack addicts recovering aren't expected to watch someone do crack. And yet here I am surrounded by alcohol with family visiting out of town. Nothing is sloppy (yet), but even if it wasn't, it would be rude if I left. I never get to see them, it just kind of sucks that I need to be in this situation and work through myself and my problems. I'm finding it hard to think of other addictions that are treated this way. I'm fine, I still have boundaries, its just not fair and I want to complain! ",Alcoholism

"That?s a rough(honestly, probably low end) of what I have spent on booze of the past 10 years. 95,250 fucking dollars of misery. I could have used it for retirement, hobbies, or vacations that I?d actually remember. I was always scared to roughly add it up, but who wants to know. Not to mention the first 5 years I spent drinking expensive scotch. Of course, like all alcoholics,I got crafty with how to be cheap so can enjoy the first few until the inevitable spiral. The fall into the dark place where the other guy hides. Then have 10 more with him until I black out and forget who either of us are. The fact is I can?t afford to be that way.

"Possible tw, bc this ties into weight as well. I won't use numbers though, I know that can be triggering for some.

I only super watch my weight when I definitely need to lose some, otherwise I'm pretty casual about it. Right now my weight goal on my Fitbit is set for the lowest weight I previously had recorded on it. That previous weight was from 2016 - before my relapse. My last recorded weight on there symbolizes the point in my last recovery that I realized I'd lost more than I thought I could (still healthy weight, to be clear) and was confident enough to stop tracking it. I had confidence I'd stay around that weight by then and didn't want to get too obsessive since I was back into healthy territory and would still be fine either losing or gaining a couple pounds. And I was fine. Up until I relapsed on alcohol later in 2016; then it all started creeping back and then some.",Alcoholism
"Day 7 checking in. Not sure how long I'll be doing daily check-ins. We shall see how it feels going along.

Went to the grocery store and it didn't even cross my mind to go check out the beer cooler for my favorite IPA. I remember what this feels like from previous attempts at sobriety. It might be a sign of progress, sure, but the novelty wears off quickly as something could easily trigger cravings at any moment. Instant gratification is deceitful and tempting.

I've also been tending to my somewhat-neglected indoor plants this past week. No causalities, thankfully. I even picked up a few more at store as treat to celebrate one week.",Alcoholism
"Still feeling very restless and anxious , can?t sleep or eat and have this brain fog ?.. can?t keep going down this road ?.

Everyone was nice. I listened but didn?t talk. It was a small group as I live in a quiet and seasonal beach town. I?m only sober a few days. I have no desire to drink right now. I?ve lost the three people I love most and am really sad and have to do better moving forward.,Alcoholism
"""Give up alcohol and never give up on myself again"" were the words that came to me today as I ran into a super strong wind, getting those three miles in that were on my training plan. I can do it, you can do it, we can do it, Yeah!!!!! ",Alcoholism
"I have a great friend who has been trying to help me get sober for a long time now. She deals with all of my bs and Im blessed to have her. But i pushed too far last night, I asked her to help me buy alcohol. Shes very obviously upset with me now and I dont know what to do. I cant lose her to this too.",Alcoholism
"I grew up in AA halls, my parents got sober when I was 8/9- and I was very involved and like, babysat all the little kids there and went to birthday nights and all of our family friends were from AA eventually my mom became one of the elders and people would always come to her for advice, she sponsored a lot of women- I started drinking and partying when I was 13, Im now 39- and cant go a few days without sneaking alcohol and then lying when I'm caught. Anyway- I want control over my life and I know that not drinking is the only way for me to get that. HOWEVER- I have so much resentment against AA that the idea of going or doing step work or even having to listen to slogans makes my blood pressure literally rise and I get MAD. Bc I have watched the loads of bullshit roll out of my insane mother my whole life while she abused and neglected us and had pill addiction that she never addressed. But still claims 30 plus years sober. I don't know if I can ever get past the hatred for AA as an entity to find success with it.",Alcoholism
"I've been sober for about 8 months. Was a daily (but not always heavy) drinker before this with some periods of sobriety. Basically a functioning alcoholic on and off for around 20 years.

Anyway, I don't think I've ever had to deal with a significant life crisis without alcohol before and now a family member is terminally ill.

I won't drink. I'm sure of that (whilst being mindful of the potential to slip) . But I realised today that I now don't have the crutch of reaching for a drink to take the edge off difficult things. And because I always used alcohol, I haven't developed other healthy habits or mechanisms for dealing with tough stuff, like death or loss.

I'm planning on dusting off my running shoes and have booked therapy. But I'm wondering if anyone has any other advice for dealing with this horrible situation. Thanks!",Alcoholism
"I?ve been doing so good, not drinking for a while now and not overthinking about it either. But today a character on a TV show pored a finger of liquor into a short glass of tinkling ice and it set off almost ten minutes of me daydreaming about picking up a bottle at the corner for a nice cozy Sunday at home because I deserve a break. I just shook myself out of it and I?m a little scared, I thought I was past this?",Alcoholism
"I use to be a heavy drinker but the dog makes me so happy. I love going out at night usually to gets drink but he starts crying if I?m not around the house. Also when I get home he usually is happy. Reminds me of when my daughter was 3 years old.

Today I went out had 4 beers after two months of not going drinking usually it would be 18 to 24 any given night. Just feel like I have a purpose again. Love my teen but she is so indifferent and wife we have a business together so I get tired of hearing her nag all day.",Alcoholism
"I am pretty frugal most of the time. I have not had a truck payment in 7 years. Fix most things around the house because I don't want to pay a contractor. Make most of our meals at home. But that seems to go out the window when it comes to drinking. I have been eyeing a decent pair of headphones for a while but haven't pulled the trigger because I didn't want to spend the money. Forget about the $30 three beer lunch, walking across the parking lot for $8 craft beers in the afternoon, and stopping at a dive on the way home for cheap $2 beers. Could've had several pair of nice headphones by now. Im not going crazy, but trying to swap some small things in place of drinking money on top of saving some. A few more sober days and those ear buds will be mine.",Alcoholism
"I was doing great!! I was feeling very good, health wise, etc.!! Then after 51 days, I had just a few beers. Then about a week later, another slip up. Etc. etc. etc. What does one do? I guess just start again and lick my wounds and admit I'm human? ",Alcoholism
"Not sure why it's sticking this time. I drank whiskey every night until one month ago. Previous record was 13 days I think. Cravings have reduced a ton although that ""you can moderate"" thought has appeared a few times. Feeling great and looking a lot better. Sleeping / waking up / anxiety / depression is 100x better.

When I started I told myself I can drink on the 19th guilt free. I really don't want to throw this progress away, I'm feeling too good.",Alcoholism
"I?m having a sort of hard time? Saturday nights are my ?Friday night? and since being sober it?s been difficult to find a social thing to replace what was usually going out to a bar with friends. I had some fleeting invasive boozy thoughts leaving work but reminded myself that drinking really sucks and it?s my brain trying to convince me it?s fun. When I don?t drink I don?t have something that?s keeping me awake, so after work I?ve been tired and nothing feels appealing to do. Then I go home and sit there bored and shower for 45 minutes just to fill the time before I go to bed. Im trying to change my mindset to being excited for the morning instead. I plan coffee with friends as early as I can. Maybe this is the way to really solidify my sobriety in the beginning since I?m only at 15 days. I JUST FEEL SO DAMN BORED AND LONELY. Doesn?t help that I?m single and keep trying to be friends with my ex just to fill the void. It?s complicated",Alcoholism
"I?ve quit drinking a few times now, never permanently (but always for good). I made plans with friends to meet up and go shopping, but because I drank too much last night, I woke up 15 minutes after we were supposed to meet. My dog didn?t get a proper walk because I was rushing to my friends, and she peed in one of the stores. I lied to them about why I was late. Thanks for being here. Time to start again.",Alcoholism
"This is getting really exhausting now.

I had eighteen months sobriety until August last year and things have been a shit show since then. I've constantly wanted to stop again but haven't managed any more than a week.

All the things that used to help - journalling, sobriety podcasts, reading - make no difference any more. Doesn't matter what I do I can't stop.

I don't know where to turn. This period of drinking is the worst it's ever been and I just wanna stop.",Alcoholism
"I'm usually drunk by now and it's not even 9pm. Today is day 2, yesterday I was hungover and was useless work. I've been on this sub for a while but wanted to make a throw away to post because I'm finally ready to stop drinking. I'm a functional alcoholic. I'm a single mom and I have a great job - a lot to lose. I'm tired of managing this struggle. Stress makes me drink, and I'm stressed everyday. But drinking is just making it worse. I've been struggling to not drink tonight. I've had three different non-alcoholic drinks that I never make at night, just to drink something cold back to back. I keep telling myself that I don't want to do anything embarrassing tonight, I don't want to have conversations I don't remember, I want to be a more present mom, and I want to wake up without a hangover tomorrow. Three days will sadly be something to celebrate for me. I'm hoping I can make it longer than that though.",Alcoholism

"Being sober for the first time in 11 years plus is teaching me to appreciate the little things. I think as drunks we convince ourselves food is better drunk, but since quitting booze I?ve noticed those subtle flavours so much more in cooking. For those struggling, occupy an evening cooking, you just might surprise yourself with how much more flavour your food may have.",Alcoholism
"This was the kind of week that, in the past, would have sent me right to the beer aisle to ?blow off some steam? and would have led to me waking up hungover and hating myself. Instead, today I woke up exhausted after staying up playing board games with friends and pounding a 12 pack of la croix.

"I relapsed during all the corona virus lock downs and of course, at first, I didn't think it would be a problem. Almost two years on and it has definitely become a problem, it's impacting my relationships, impacting me financially of course and my mental health is at an all time low. Even though this is one of the worst places my drinking has taken me, for some reason for the first time in my life, stopping seems more overwhelming than it ever has. Previously when I have recognised myself going down this path I have been able to ""take it on day at a time"" etc with a lot of success but I don't feel connected at all with the person who was able to take charge like that, I just feel at a loss.",Alcoholism
"First sober weekend since years. Pizza is in the oven right now. Enjoying some Soda. Gonna watch a movie and before bed I am going to read.

I feel better. But so ashamed

It is getting better. I will not destroy the Rest of my Life.

"I?m at the airport right now in the Midwest, about to board my flight back home. You guys, I?m so fucking proud of myself. I?ve been stressing about this business trip for a while now because it is my first out of state trip since I quit drinking in January.

There were a couple nights when I got back to my hotel room after a long day of work that I really really really wanted to get a bottle (or 2) of wine. I played the tape forward and read/posted on this sub every day.

A couple month?s ago, I could barely forgo drinking for more than a day? and here I am, approaching 50 days.",Alcoholism
"And I did it, I didn't drink anything other than water. I played pool and darts, had a great time, and left sober. Waking up today I had no shame or regrets, I'm just happy with myself and not hungover.

The temptation to drink was there, knowing how easy I could order a drink, but I held firm and didn't give in.

I just wanted to post today because I'm very happy I was able to do this. 2 months strong.",Alcoholism
"Wanted to share with all the people in this group that are new, just do it day by day. I used to read this sub in the beginning and feel so lost and hopeless seeing all the huge day counts and people commenting on how everything is coming together as I was falling apart.

I?m so sick and tired of having an alcohol dependency but I can?t kick it. I?ve tried multiple different methods to try and kick it but no luck. The problem is my brain is 1. Damaged from years of heavy drinking and 2. Dependent on the alcohol. It is miserable to live like this. It?s just sad. My son deserves so much better. ,Alcoholism
"So I haven't been very active in a while, after the pink cloud brutally dumped my ass I went into a pretty dark place and have been through some heavy shit but I'm still here. I fell out of love with sobriety, now I see it as just a part of who I am (or who I'm not anymore) so I thought it was time to do something I had postponed for too long: reading some quit lit. I got quit like a woman and I didn't expect to love it, I was just in a validation that I'm doing the right thing mindset but the book is actually really good and I am slowly becoming proud of myself again.

I could have had so many excuses to drink for the past month or so and yet, I'm proud to say I don't need a day count reset. I've also made some important and very much needed positive changes in my life while feeling like shit and it feels like a major win.",Alcoholism
"There were a couple of days when I was tempted to throw it all away so I could ""treat"" myself to a drink. Dark days, celebratory days, bored days. I just kept thinking about this day right here. Six months.

Longest ive gone in my entire adult life without a drink and Im in my 30s. And Im a bartender. Just looking for someone to tell me Im doin good I guess. Feeling lonely just watching tv and drinking grapefruit soda tonight,Alcoholism
"I decided to do Dry January cause I knew my drinking had gotten worse over the years and I figured it would help to experience a break. It was never really my intention to quit, just a break. After week 3 I was feeling really good. I was productive at work, I felt rested on my weekends, and I was never missing workouts. I really started to consider just getting rid of alcohol all together cause I felt great.

Then January came to an end and those thoughts crept back into my head ?Do you REALLY think you are NEVER gonna have another drink until the day you die? Come on man just be better than before and you can manage this, you already reached your goal.?

And I did manage it, I drank a little bit and had some fun and didn?t get smashed. Seemed fine.",Alcoholism
Don?t worry I didn?t drink but I stayed up till 1AM watching tv and now I?m tired. I still feel better than after a night of drinking though! Have a great Saturday guys! I know I?ll be checking in later. Going out to dinner w the in-laws (double trigger for me).,Alcoholism
"well, yea, this happens quite often I guess. I quit drinking in August and was very happy, then life kind of fucked me over 2 weeks ago and I poured that shit into myself to cope. I noticed I already lost control very fast, so I went to the hospital yesterday morning and told them about it. 31 hours sober now and already feeling better, although my body somehow has a strong addictive memory, so I still have very stressful withdrawal symptoms.

Always remember, don't drink! Never, it must never be an option for your brain. But if you do, go get help r i g h t away. Love to everybody who wants to quit. Even if there are setbacks, you can make it.",Alcoholism
"Long story short, I had been running since I was 11 years old and turned 33 last week. Ran for over 20 years with really limited time away from the sport. Life got in the way and I decided to take off over 4 months and now looking at getting back into it again. Running history, is had multiple years where I averaged well over 100 miles a week, and avg over my life time is 50 mpw. During the 4 months off I gained probably about 30 pounds because I was eating way different then I was when training, I also drank a lot more during that time. As I get back into it, I'm cutting out drinking and the bad eating habits. Any one know from experience how long it will take before I drop the added weight?",Alcoholism
"To be clear, Ive never been neglectful or harmful to my children because of my drinking. But I'm definitely too tired some mornings, I'm out of shape because I want to start drinking as soon as I get off work then eat all night. I stopped for the first 4 months of their life and felt so much better, then fell into old bad habits from the stress of life.

This morning my wife and I hung up streamers in the kitchen and made them rainbow pancakes for their birthday breakfast and I secretly told them both that I would be making some changes to be a better, healthier Daddy this year so that when they learn how to run around the back yard, I'll be able to play as much as they want.

"I won't go into details but I have found something out that has hurt me very badly.

"I woke up and saw the timer on the I am sober app and really had tears spring to my eyes.

Sobriety has been hard. I haven?t made it this far in 7 years, maybe longer.

It was time to clean up the party, and it feels so good to actually believe in myself a little more each day. Alcohol really robbed me of the faith I had in myself to do what was hard.

I'm 28 days sober and still feel like shit. I'll get over that. Anyway every post I read talk about how hard it is. Which trust me I know. But has anyone considered the money that they are saving.. When it come to smoking you hear a lot about how expensive it is. But not when drinking.. Me for example was spending over $200 a waek on bourbon and vodka. I can't believe how good my bank account looks now. I'm even starting to invest the money in an etf. And feeling great about it. To me saving money is a good insensitive not to drink. Any thoughts...,Alcoholism
