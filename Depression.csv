Description,Mental State
"I need help I don't cry but I'm crying my whole life out I've already failed tryna post this to various subs I really wouldn't do this Im 27 and act like a teenager in some aspects, I'm probably an alcoholic but have gone 48+ without a drink and I smoke weed heavily and havnt smoked since Christmas eve  I'm very immature and struggling, have has at least 3 episodes of spontaneous suicidal attempts and have spent the past year mentally drained and jobless I lost my job due to my head 

Everyone keeps saying I must try and push through this, but what if I wasn't meant to live to be old? I feel as though I'm done with my life I have had amazing times and I love the friends I have made but I can not see a future 

What if my being is done and my times up? I'm thinking about not wanting to be alive and the only thing that's stopping me is my loved ones but it pains me to say this isn't a new thought, I've had enough and I don't want to live any more, all I have done for the past two years is cry, sleep, drink myself into oblivion, smoke weed and wish i was never born 

I'm adhd and trialed medication last year, that made me out of character. I stole foreign holiday money and transfered it back into my own currency to buy spirits so that I could drink myself stupid, that isn't me I used to be so full of life enthusiastic and happy, I was everyone's favorite pal Joel 

This isn't new I've been in a state for two years at least now 

So why are we meant to live out our lives untill we die? I feel as though I'm done and want to go only I can't because I'll be seriously letting down the ones I care for 

I type this in tears I'm sorry but reddit is the only place I kknkw to go to, I don't want sympothy so be harsh if you have to but please someone tell me wtf I need to do because biting my lip and straigting myself up and fighting isn't working any more. I don't want to die but I swear I don't want to live ",Depression
"I'm so alone I'm alone. People either fuck me over or abandon me. No cares to see how I am doing. If they do it's only once if they need smth. Everyone ends up disappointing me.

I've tried everything: gym, professional help, meds, socializing etc nothing ever fucking helps, ever. I've given up trying. I'm too old and washed. I'm tired. I partly wish I was suicidal cause atleast I could feel smth. But I'm too empty for that. I can't take this endless cycle anymore 

Im pathetic, I'd be better off gone. ",Depression
"Anyone else taking the long suicide? Not kill yourself but not living either. just waiting for death? That's me. One of the reasons is that I am terrified of death. Worst part, there is nothing I can do about it. The very fact I was born means death will be coming eventually. No matter what I will eventually die, and this terrifies me. I watched my father die of cancer and my mother take her own life. I was alone with them when they died. 4 years apart. I had my mom pull a gun on me. 

I've lost the will to live. I pretend that I'm ok. But really I'm not. I come on reddit and vent my anger to people, wishing harm on them, getting angry, because I don't deal with my problems in a healthy way but I'd rather funnel it into mean words than getting physical violent with my home or myself. 

People in my life care about me, are understanding, and do worry. But at my core there is just a void that sucks everything in me away. 

I don't care to live. I don't want to die but I don't want to live. I'm at a standstill. I'm in limbo. ",Depression
"12 days into Effexor withdrawal... The hives are terrible. Everywhere, all the time. They've started spreading to my face. My jaw has swelled up, I look like the Michelin man. 

Don't even get me started with the mood swings and nausea. I'm going to give myself another week. If it's not gone by then I'm going back on 37.5 mgs. I have a life to live (albeit not very productive). Exams at the end of the month, a full time job. I don't have time for this shit. Everyone (even my doctor) said it would be done by now. Someone kill me. ",Depression
"Cognitive Behavioral Therapy? I've had a rough couple of months, partially in December when my gf and I broke up. I've always dealt with depression but would usually find a way to keep it at bay. From drugs and alcohol to jumping into relationships with terrible people. 

I'm now 31 and am tired. I'm tired of hating myself, life and wanting to end it. I started going to therapy about 2 weeks ago and have a session this Friday. The therapist and I talked a bit about CBT and pills. I want pills - a quick fix but I know that won't help permanently. 

What has your experience been with CBT? Did you find it worked or failed you and why?

Thanks. ",Depression

"Lonely and losing hope For me, the holidays only remind me of how nobody cares about me. Now that there over and we are in 2019 now, I feel as if this year will be the same. 2018 taught me a lot about myself and how people do not care or listen to me. I feel like no one is there for me no matter who I become close with because they will always lose interest and I will eventually be nonexistent in their lives. I always made the effort to spend time with others or talk on the phone and listen to them and none of it mattered. In 2018 I made it a point to self improve and be out in the world and talk to anyone I meet. Legit, my day would start off at college in the mornings and then working 1230pm to 9pm and then going to the gym for an hour after that. I put myself out there so many times in the past year between many failed relationships, connections/networking, and friendships. Every other aspect of my life is fine except my social life. My family seems to shrug off the fact that I'm very lonely and all I do is college/work/workout/sleep and I explain to them that it's not normal for a 19 year old to be so alone. I hope things will change this year because I am gradually losing hope.",Depression

"How do I date without becoming depressed? Hey all,

I'm a 25 year old guy and I've never been in a relationship. I really have no idea why it never happened for me, but if I were to wager a guess, I had pretty constant issues with anxiety and depression through middle and high school, and in college I devoted all of my energy to my studies. In short, I never looked for a relationship, so here's where I find myself.

I really haven't experienced depression since high school, and I've been off Zoloft for close to five years. I still have a constant struggle with anxiety, but in general I'd say that I'm doing pretty good in life. However, I've been feeling lonely over the past year, so I've turned to dating apps, and I've been getting pretty disillusioned.

I have no problem getting first or even second dates with girls I'm interested in. However, right around that time it seems like they start to loose interest, and inevitably they always end it. This really hurts, because I'm really looking for a long-term relationship, and with this constantly happening I'm questioning if I'm doing something wrong.

I'm not looking for dating advice. I think the bigger problem is I'm letting this inability to successfully find a relationship take up my life; and I'm not able to find happiness alone. I want to continue to date, but I want to be able to date without becoming depressed when things don't work out...",Depression

"FTP: I'm not having suicidal thoughts but everything is hard all the time Let me start with I've been worseù but I'm not taking care of myself. With that, I fall further and further behind on the things I need to do to take care of my family (husband and toddler). I am just exhausted, I wish some days I could stay in bed allll day long. My husband cares for me and let me do this today but now I just feel bad about it. I feel bad about everything I do because I feel like I'm not really ever doing much right. This feeling gets validated at work when my coworkers pick fights with me because of my awful personalityù. (Small context there, I reiterated orders from someone higher up and my co worker took the opportunity to scream at me for 20 minutes about how I'm not his boss. It was true ludicrous) and this feeling gets validated when my friendsù just full out stop talking to me when I say I'm not suicidal. 

I know I'm not perfect and never will be. No one is. But these feelings are so hard to ignore. They are so hard to set aside. I know what a piece of shit I am, I know how little I've worked to get where I am today. I'm spoiled in so many ways and live a fairly privileged life. I feel like a terrible person simply for feeling like I do. I should be happy. I should be able to carry on in life and not get stuck on the little things. 

But I can't. For years I can't. Is this what drowning feels like? ",Depression

"My friend is struggling with depression and suicide. How do I help them? This is a throwaway account, because my other friends know my main account.

As the title says, I have a friend who constantly struggles with self-worth and depression. they've spoken to me multiple times about these issues. I try to console them, I try to help them with their issues regarding motivation, I try proposing solutions to them. I've talked to them about where these thoughts come from, and they've opened up to me about a lot of things. They always thank me for talking to them, but I feel like I'm not doing enough. Today, they talked to me about feeling like they make the world worse by existing, and I didn't really know how to respond. 

How would you want someone to talk to you? How do I be a better friend for them?",Depression
"Not sure if this belongs here but I've been doing pretty well combating my depression and anxiety, but I still don't know where to start with making friends again. My SA/depression caused me to completely isolate myself when I was in high school so now I'm not even sure where to start when it comes to making new friends and then keeping those friends. I'm hoping I somehow figure it out this year *fingers crossed*.",Depression
"All I want to, is to have the guts to kill myself This hapenned when I was taking music classes on a Music school (where I had normal subjects like history or math too) 

Years ago, there was this one girl I couldnt stop think about. We dated for 2 years and those were the best memories of my life. But things got a little though and we started breaking up every other month and it was feeling like an infinte loop. Thats when the suicide toughts started and it followed me with a suicide attempt, I used to hate my family I really couldn't stand near them or I would have some kind of mental breakdown. After more and more problems with my Ex, I could only see one solution, which was being brave enough to leave her. Which was when I decided to break up with her on her birthday, just so I could end this up for once and for all. This hapenned when school year ended.

After holidays and about to start a new school year I heard that my ex was about to join the same school. And the only way out I saw was to leave that same school and give up on my musician dream.

And that's exactly what I did. 4 days before 1st school day, I changed to a normal school where I learned computer science and eletronics.

I was always feeling the need to go back to my ex and old school.

Then 4 years passed. I hated the course I took. Left my musician dream. And didn't get anything close to a girlfriend because I couldn't have any contact with a girl because I'm too shy. AND also still had feelings for my ex.



I finished school and had hundreds of panic attacks because I didn't know what to do, which path to take. 

1 month ago I got a job at McDonald's and oh boy, that feels like the biggest mistake of my life, I hate it with everything I have, the managers are mean to me, some employers do me a nightmare and I have terrible shifts (sometimes 11am- 22pm which would make me lose all day). 

All I want to do with this job is to stop working and leave it without notice, because if i give notice I'll have to work another 30 days just to give time to the house. Which sucks considering I can't survive another day in there.



Yesteday was new year's eve and oh god, that was the most depressing I've ever had, I was having fun with the drinks till like 3 am but after that, all I felt was emptiness, as if i had no soul or feelings. Well maybe I had feelings cause I had a tear on my eyes and it just wouldn't go off. 



Today 01/01 I was supposed to flip some burgers at McDonalds but I missed work thanks to the hangover I had. Tomorrow I have a long shift too and all I want to do is to disappear or kill myself before it because I cant miss another day and I don't even know what happens if I just stop going to work, my mom keeps telling my they can sue me and thats why I can't take it or simply tell her I won't go anymore. 



I feel lost, want to commite suicide, still in love with 4 years ago ex, ran away from music dream and lost 4 years taking a course I hate. This is my life and I'm afraid of seeking for help. This is also the first time I've written anything about my life publicly and I'm only doing it because I don't think I can go through this alone anymore.

"Retaking the wheel I've spent my whole life with depression but I've always managed to keep a hand on the proverbial wheel and help others do the same grab them out of there own horrible Hellscape while looking at mine all the time but recently I've just sort of let go and let it drag me under all my effort to stay above it gone drowning in sadness and loneliness and realised that all the people I've dragged out of the hole,  not realise I'm sinking.

"I'm 16 and I'm already such a failure My dad told me again how I need to study more, how I need to get better grades if I want to get in a good college. How I need to do study for the SAT next year. How I don't have much time left before it's too late. Especially because my school is very low ranking. 

He keeps telling me how I need to develop my hobbies and get better at them.

But getting up to go to school takes more willpower than anything. Simply getting my homework done, let alone doing it well is one of the most difficult parts of my day. I can't find any reason to do anything but stay in bed. 

I know that I won't get into college let alone graduate. I know I'm gonna end up flipping burgers at McDonalds for a living. 

I'm such a fuck up, disappointing, failure.

"Friendly reminder today matters just as much as any other day For a long time I have always felt that January 1st of any year was the most important and meaningful; that I should be doing something big, something memorable, something worth getting excited about. I tried that off and on, this year, I laid in bed all day (and yesterday night too).

I felt guilty, but realized its silly to feel that way. You dont need to do something crazy. Its kind of silly what a big deal we make of New Years anyway... That being said, I hope everyone here has a happy one. My 2018 was really shitty, and the last month has been suuuuuuper shitty, so maybe 2019 can be better? Hard to imagine it getting worse.

"Wife of the year right here. Probably shouldn't have told my husband, who is chronically depressed and going through what he refers to as ""the blues"" right now, that I have been dealing with suicidal ideation for quite some time. 

He knows that I have issues with anxiety, but this is the first time I have ever told anyone about my issues with depression and suicide. So now I'm freaked out because he's having issues and he's freaking out about mine.

"Escitalopram  

Wondering if anyone here has used or currently uses escitalopram. 

I've been on 20mg for about a month now, and recently noticed a few side effects. Muscle twitching, especially when trying to fall asleep but also happens throughout the day. 
I'm also hot, all the time. I used to always be freezing but since starting these meds 3 months ago I'm constantly warm. 
My sinuses are blocked; definitely not sick and no snot just constantly stuffed up.
Today I bought sinutab to see if it would help, pharmacist said no serious interactions but might make sure effects worse.
I've been feeling off all day, but I took the sinus meds to see if it would help and was ok most of the day but just had a small panic attack.

I'm not going to take them again, but I'm hoping the muscle spasms and sinus congestion will go away after some more time, and maybe even the sweating.

"Nobody believes me Ok so... I used to have pretty manageable depression.  ""High-functioning"" depression I think they call it.  I feel like I've been struggling in silence and in secret most of my life.  I always thought I should probably go to therapy and get help because if anything tragic happened I had this feeling that everything would start to fall apart.  This fake veneer I've built will finally come crashing down like a delicate house of cards.



Well.... Something extremely traumatic and unexpected happened.  And oh boy.  The cheese has finally slid off my cracker.  I'm losing it, I really am.  I can't get up.  I seriously can't.  I've been in bed almost continuously for three days.  I can't eat.  I can't make food.  And if I do somehow have food and put it in my mouth it makes me want to gag and I can't eat it anyways.  I'm unintentionally fasting for days at a time, and I usually only eat half a chocolate bar when I do finally eat.



I can't function.  I can't.  This is the worst I've ever been.  I can't take a shower.  I can't eat.  I also can't sleep.  I'm slowly slipping into madness.



I called my family and told them that I'm struggling and they said ""no you're not, you're doing great.""  everyone, literally everyone is saying that.  The veneer I've kept up so long, so fucking long, that's all they see.  ""I need help, I am not ok""  is always met with ""it seems like you're handling this really well""  



Holy shit I'm losing my mind.  I haven't done laundry in over a month.  I can't sleep or eat or function or think and I don't remember anything from the past 3 months.  My memory has turned into that of a goldfish.  I keep repeating the same conversations with the same people literally 5 days in a row.



I had this veneer act up for so long now I don't know how to turn it off.

"Just turned 25 and super depressed I have suffered periods of depression over the past few years, but last week I turned 25 and I am now the worst I have ever been. I feel like right now I should really be on track with my life yet I am so discontent with it that it's making me feel like giving up.

I just moved back into my mothers poor house because I failed a module at uni and need to resit in July. I have no friends, no life, all I do is wake up at 5am every day to go and work a mind numbing job in a petrol station, then come home and watch youtube or play guitar. 

2 years ago I felt so good, I was living with my girlfriend at the time, was enjoying my education, had a decent part time job and was doing fun things, I loved my life and was an independent adult. Now, I feel like I have reverted back to being a teenager.

Has anybody else struggled with turning 25? Is it a normal thing to reflect at this age or am I perhaps feeling this way strictly because of my circumstances. Thanks.

Except at the end of it there is no happy ending. There is no knight in shining armour, no princess saved. Only thing left is you. Because either you pushed them away or you were so passive, so unwilling to act, to do something. Just stood there, watching people leave you. Maby its for the best.

"Depressed that I've had to go to a psych ward... 3 times in 2018 (vent) 23M. Just thinking back to where I was a year ago today. Everything at least on the outside looking in was fine. University grades was good. Had friends. But was supplementing a lot of my pain by smoking marijuana. And would sit in my bed staring at the wall listening to dark music when no one was noticing. And leaving social events early to be with myself. Eventually I just started to socially withdraw because I started to feel disconnected with my friends. Felt a deep sense of self loathing. Felt throughout University like I always had to put in twice the effort to accomplish the same things as my friends. Burned me out. Drank alcohol just to blend in with the rest of the crowd even though I hated it (I don't know why I continued this habit. I hate alcohol, but always felt left out if I didn't drink too). Talked to girls, but could never muster the courage to take it past talking. I wouldn't know what the hell to do, and anytime I did, it was just opening a door to my low self esteem, which some girls would feel pity over and give me a chance, but I loathe it when people feel pity for me so fuck that. Not being in any relationship where the other person pity's me who the fuck would. I kept all of this inside, and my inability to pass grad school entrance exam made it hurt more. If I had this in hand, I would have probably been able to carry on the baggage I had inside my head, have my pride in hand, but felt absolutely miserable. Not gonna lie I remember thinking this a year ago, and settling for it as adequate, and would've taken it. But life had other plans, and my mental health spiraled out of control. I've had a chance to deal with a lot of the fallout, but holy shit was it a painful experience. Traumatic and just downright miserable. 3 hospital visits where I wasn't accustomed to the particular population that's attracted to these places. My soul felt crushed and my pride was broken. My family was torn apart, and it became a me vs them thing. The pain is still there, but loads better. Family better too. I still need to do a little soul searching so my identity is stronger. I'm still hurt, but holy hell, that was one hell of a fight. So much pain. So much hatred. So much powerlessness. God damn 2018. Hell on earth. Truly a hell. ",Depression

"Goodbye Hello,
First of all I want to thank reddit in general for helping me through some tough times, but unfortunately this time it was not enough. I really think pretty much  everyone, but me is able to get over this piece of shit of a disease and I really hope no one makes as bad of a decision as me tonight. Please dont kill yourself. Somebody must care for you. I know that there are a few people that might recognize me from this post, but I promise you it's not your fault. I have a mental illness and I apparently can't help it. In a way I really want to just go to sleep for ever, but like I don't want to  dissapoint  everyone and/or hurt anyone, but like I just fucking can't control myself at the moment. Jere you are probably one of the best and smoothest guys I've ever met. And just to add to this, Ilona you've been super nice to me always and you two seem to be nearly pertect for each other. I really hope you and Jere go far in your relationship. Joonas, you and your whole freacking family are amazing. Please post your pictures so that everyone can appreciate them, you are a great artist please don't ever doubt yourself. You are a fucking amazing photographer and I need you to share them with the world. Leo, dude stop stressing it. You are very good looking by anyones standards. You are so fucking friendly to everyone, any girl that gets you doesnt really deserve you. Just be confident and you will acheive anything you want, you are great. You will acheive great things in this lifetime so just love  urslf. Serously Im sorry but I just cant. However I want to congratulate you, for being amazing friends (Jere eventhough you would somehow get a miracle and find a way to do what you ""owe"" me, just fucking stop. I just make everyone feel like shit, last night it was your girlfriend, and tonight it's Toni, you and Joonas.) And the thing is  I do not deserve anyone, I just make everyone feel bad. 

I probably shuld'nt maneany rash decisions at the moment. Sorry.",Depression
"Blurry Months After suffering from Depression since the late teenage years I finally finished school a few years ago. At that time I felt enthusiastic about the options live gave me. At that time I also found a girlfriend. 
Although it was a long distance relationship I was happier than ever. 
In March this year she broke up with me.
After that everything feels like a blur. While my only friend moved away to study and found new friends, I stayed home and did nothing. Sometimes it feels like she broke up with me yesterday, because the last months feel like a blur. I just went to work and played video games on the weekends and after work. I don't have any friends (except online ?friends) in a 300km Radius.",Depression
"Anyone actually okay with being depressed? The past year and a bit has been one long depressive episode, and continues to be so. I don't have depression but I exhibit a number of the symptoms.

Despite my feelings, or rather lack of feelings in general, I don't actually mind continuing life like this. There's some things that excite me every now and then, but even between those moments, I'm indifferent towards my own depression.

"Do I have depression? I can't get diagnosed because my mom doesn't believe in mental illness. Sometimes I feel like my life is going well; I finished 3rd in my class for the semester, I exercise a lot, I have friends. However,  since I found out we're moving out of state, I started getting really bad episodes of sadnessù (I don't know how else to describe it); I'd cry myself to sleep, withdraw from my friends, and just overall feel like shit. I don't even understand how I feel about moving; I'm either really mad/sad because I don't agree with the reason why we're moving (which is for a religion I don't believe in) and because I'd leave behind a reputation that took me years to build, or kind of okay with it because I feel like my friends aren't true friends and I'd get a chance to start new. I don't understand why I feel these things since they completely contradict each other, and I feel like I'm going crazy. There's nothing I can do about moving and I've sort of withdrawn from my parents because they believe there's absolutely nothing wrong and only try to convince me that what we're doing is good. I don't know if I have depression or if it's just normal to feel sad about this kind of stuff, but I need help finding out.

"I Hate Happy People Not those people themselves, but I hate the fact that so, so many people are happy and content with their lives and have somebody to love and I don't and most likely never will. They'll have their ups and downs but they'll get through it because they were born with a brain that produces a normal amount of serotonin.

I don't fucking have that. I was born fucked up and I will die that way. Too weird to live, too rare to die. I'm stuck in limbo, drinking heavily and smoking cigarettes to speed things up. I get to walk down the street and be tormented by young, happy couples holding each other and generally loving their time on earth. It makes me so sick of myself and sick of the fact I've never had a relationship. I met the perfect girl this year and I was nuts for her. It turns out she probably doesn't even see me as a friend.

I only see his faults and think he's unattractive. Now I don't know if this is the truth, a thought I kinda talked myself into or an intrusive thought :( I can obsess over a lot... :( 

I'm also either crying or I feel numb all the time. It's hard for me to have positive feelings towards him. I'm taking 10mg lexapro at the moment, so I don't know if this causes problems too? 

:( I guess it's another crisis in my life.. ",Depression
"No matter how much I try. I'm never gonna be the cute girl on the bench. 2019 already sucks, man.       

Spent the first four hours crying.     

Self-harmed. It still hurts when I touch my left wrist. I don't know how I managed to make four red spots, I don't think I sunk four nails in it.     

I don't think I ever hurted myself so much, physically.    

Today I went for a run and first thing I saw was a young, pretty skinny girl in a bench with a boy probably her same age. He had his arm in her back. He clearly wanted to be more than friends with her.     

And there I was, a horrible fat girl staring at them. In a huge, heavy outfit at 82?¯F. Trying to run to get fit, for the third year.      

But the moment I saw her I knew. I knew I'm never gonna be like her. As much as I try, I'm never gonna be a beautiful fit young girl sitting in a park bench with a guy wanting to be more than friends with her.      

So why the fuck keep trying.

"Nothing to look forward to It's funny that i strongly felt this feeling of nothing to look forward to in my life, considering it is new year's day today. 

Let me explain: I look forward towards the future and i don't feel excited.

"I don't care about my parents And I always thought that was kind of weird. I remember often comparing my family to others, and it always became pretty clear to me, that my family wasn't normal. I also often felt terrible for not being close to my parents, or about the fact that I don't care about them. But I start to realize, that they were pretty neglectful for my entire childhood and that they never really cared about me either. My parents never showed me much !affection, they never gave me praise but also never gave me some kind direction or set any boundaries. They didn't give me any parenting in general, never had ""serious"" conversations, never asked about how I feel or how my day went, never supported me. They just let me be, we really just lived alongside of eachother. The only times I heard my mother's voice was either when she was fighting with my dad, which happened quite a lot, or when she complained to us about her life. She would also often threaten suicide if you didn't immediately do what she said, even if it was just a ""can you hand me the salt"" and you were busy for a second.

Now that I have moved out for college, my mum always tries to shame me for moving away and tells me that I should move back home because ""now she's around, but she may not be in 3 years"", an me wanting to go to a good university doesn't make sense according to her. But I just never developed a relationship to her, and honestly, I think that's her own fault. I often hear that you should be grateful for your parents and that you should love them, but why would I care about a relationship with them, when they never cared to build one over the span of 19 years? Why am I supposed to care about people that never cared about me, and still don't? I know my parents could have been a lot worse, they never abused me in any way and also never were hurtful towards me, but I still feel like they let me down as parents",Depression

There are so many problems in my family and my fiance's family right now and it's too much. I work 40 hours a week where I can escape my problems and come home with nowhere to run.

"The physical pain of depression I have experienced off and on bouts with depression since my parents split back in 2009. I'm 25 now, and the depression doesn't let up. It hurts the same now as it did back then. But my depression isn't because of my parents now. It's a culmination of events, experiences, loneliness, heartbreak, confusion, and many more nouns that are out there.

I'm writing this because the physical pain that I get is overwhelming at times. It blows my mind that thoughts can become so real that I physically feel the effect of them in my torso. The pain is real. Depression is real.

They tell us, people who suffer with depression, to think of happy thoughts or confront the negative thoughts with positive reinforcement. It works, but it's a bandaid. It doesn't heal the depression because it will come back again in an hour, day, week, month. Depression comes when it wants to, it's the ugly beast that feeds on the bad thoughts and breaths fire to my lungs.

I want to grab...
I want to grab my...
Gun.

I imagine rushing with haste to my closet to wrap my hand around the plastic handle. Press the cold barrel against my freshly shaved skull. With one loud scream, I pull. I pull the heaviest thing that could ever exist. The heaviest object in existence is decision to end my life. That pull is the last thing that I do. The last decision I make.

I sit here, in the dark. Writing to you, writing to the one who is going to read this. You are the only person I can talk to about this. You are the only one who will listen. I've tried reaching out. Family, friends, strangers. I'm met with the look of bewilderment. Who wants to console someone who says they are feeling pain from thoughts? Even as someome who suffers from depression, I do not want to talk to someone about their depression because it's depressing.

I want a family, I want a loving wife, I want beautiful children, I want a new life. I want a life that isn't filled with the erry feeling of depression. But I'm not allowed to want, right? 

I need to keep my mouth shut and deal with my problems like a man. I need to battle my own demons. But this demon keeps coming back even when I swear I defeated it many times. I truly believed that I defeated the wretched beast. 

Thank you. The pain is in restraints now. I will post this to give you some content to read. Please do not reply. I am not looking for attention. I am simply doing this to tell a story that no one seems to care about. I love you all.

Moved out of home town last year to try new start. Had a good situation fall apart. I figure no matter the situation, I will always make myself miserable.

 I hate the idea of me being happy and have no idea why. I push away my good feelings and instead force more negativity.

I feel like I have friends to talk to but instead choose misery and suffering.

I have nothing to be upset about; I feel like I want to cry but I cannot. 

I took anti-depressants for years and hated how they made me feel. I self medicate with weed and hate how dependent I am. Im sick of just coping to try to be happy.

"Everyone gets to have fun and I'm just over here suffering. Everyone around me seems so happy and full of energy. They're social and happy and have a good time enjoying each other's company.

My whole life I've suffered with anxiety, depression, IBS, sensory problems and addiction. I've been alone my whole in terms of a partner. I'm in constant discomfort from my tummy problems, constant discomfort from my sensory problems. Alcohol and caffeine and weed all fuck me up even more. I gave up weed because of how incredibly anxious it made me. Alcohol is a bitch to give up and caffeine is even harder. I'm not allowed to enjoy drugs I guess. Fair enough I suppose, but when I give them up I'm even more depressed. I see everyone get to enjoy a few drinks together, or a coffee, or get to relax with some weed, and it feels like I'm being tortured.

Torture, that's one way to describe my existence. Ok yeah there are people out there worse off, but suffering is still suffering, and I suffer endlessly because of my fucked up body and mind.

Recovering from depression is so, so hard already, but it's worse when you feel like everyone forgets about you or gets busy with other things instead. When I have a depressive episode, I need to be around people, otherwise my thoughts get really bad really quickly. So when someone makes plans with me, I'm overjoyed because I know I need to be around people. But then when I contact them about it later, they say something like oh I completely forgot about thatù or oh yeah something came up and I can't do itù and it KILLS me. 

It's for a couple reasons, actually. One, because it sucks being forgotten or turned down (and all my sadness is amplified due to the depression), and two, because I know I NEED this. But I can't tell people I need you to hang out with me or else I might want to die,ù because you just can't make people feel guilty like that. It's just so sad and frustrating and I'm left feeling like my friends have failed me again. 

I know they're not trying to hurt me intentionally, and some of them have mental illnesses themselves, but it just hurts every time it happens. I just wish non mentally ill people knew how bad it feels to have this happen, especially because I'm trying to do what's best for me. When I make plans, I mean it. I take them seriously.

"X post from /r/virtualreality [https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/abaw1s/i\_think\_vr\_is\_a\_godsend\_for\_my\_wellbeing/](https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/abaw1s/i_think_vr_is_a_godsend_for_my_wellbeing/)

Just want to share this. On the one hand I'm afraid of trapping myself in VR, on the other hand it clearly has it's benefits. Text follows:

Throwaway to stay anonymous.

I'll take the very very long story of the last 8-9 years of my life and try to make it short for this post. I have been struggling with depression, anxiety, and a pretty difficult eating disorder that has almost killed me and has really f'd with my ability to live a content life and remain PRESENT and interested in things.

I have been in and out of various levels of treatment for these things, and although they are still very much a part of my life every single day, I am at least happy to be able to say my physical health is fine and that I remain committed to therapy and treatment.

I've tried everything in and out of the treatment setting to try and aid my anxiety. I've worked out daily, I force myself to get out and be social, I have a job I like a lot, I've opened up about things to my friends and family, I have meditated daily for months on end, I've tried new hobbies (painting, sculpting, scuba diving, motorcycles {which helps a bit actually}) I give back to people, I've done various types of therapy (CBT, DBT, ACT, etc) and am currently in therapy 3x a week. And additionally, you can name a psychiatric medication and I have probably tried it before.

Fast forward, I left my last time in treatment and moved into a place with a good friend this past July. I first tried one of my friends' Vive a month or so afterward. Beforehand, I expected it was going to be *pretty* cool, maybe a bit gimmicky (like a 3D movie). When I got into it, I was fairly impressed. It was obviously much more immersive than I expected, and having been out of the gaming world for the most part of the last decade of my life, I was pretty awed by the level of creativity of the games. It was clear that the new format opens up a huge realm of new possibilities.

Travel forward to now, and I got a Vive for Xmas. Since then, I bought a new computer to run it, and have been playing through aa few games (mostly Superhot &lt;3) with my roomie. Every night that weve played, before I fire the Vive up, I think to myself something like ""Meh, I don't really feel like playing it.. doesn't sound that fun right now. But I guess I'll strap it on and at least play for a few minutes."" That type of feeling/thinking is a big part of my depression -i generally not being interested in or motivated for things, and sometimes you just have to do that thing you don't feel like

So I fire up the computer and the headset and put it on. And after about 2 minutes I am having a blast.

It wasn't til last night that I realized I have almost zero anxious thoughts when im playing on the Vive. I cannot think of another thing I've done where my mind isn't racing, telling me all the reasons Im a shitty person, all the things I should be doing, all the problems I have. Not even flying through a corner at 60+mph on a Kawasaki can relieve the automatic negative thinking I have every second.

This is such a great resource for me. It's so amazing that after I finish work and take care of chores and responsibilities, if my friends are too busy to hang out, I have thiss thing I can finally do ALONE and not feel like I'm on the edge of falling apart.

And I should clarify- I'm not using this to ignore my problems, if I didn't make that clear. I don't have urges to wake up and plug in/tune out for hours on end. I wouldn't suggest to anyone to just replace your actual life with a virtual one. In fact I think the longest session I've had was last night, probably a combined total of about an hour. I guess I am just wanting to share how relieved I am to have found a little thing that help me have a bit of peace for a while, and gets me engaged (and IN THE PRESENT for once) in a brain-intensive and active experience. And I'm excited to become a part of the VR community.

Most importantly though, I want to say something loud and clear to anyone reading this post who might be struggling with similar issues: KEEP ON GOING. You will make it, there are plenty of good reasons to live and move forward, you are not alone. There are things out there like this that can help you cultivate some excitement and engagement with life.

TL;DR life is hard but VR makes it less hard",Depression
"Just want to vent is all Hello, /r/depression. I was doing well for 6 months (until Halloween) and I haven't posted here for a year and a half. It's been awhile.

Anyway, why I'm here. I've been punching myself in the forearm and am proud of the bruises I give myself. It makes me feel a lot less weaker than I am, and that at the very least, I have a strong punch.

Everything else is lost though. I'm in EST so it's 5:30 when I'm typing this and I have been sleeping off and on all day, and haven't left my bed. All I've eaten is 2 pop tarts this morning, and there's food near my bed and I don't want to eat it. The hunger in my stomach feels a little too good and like a feat of strength. I never had an eating disorder or any serious concerns regarding body image, just the usual ""I'm fat"" moment, so nothing to worry about.

I may or may not let myself waste away. I'd be alright with it if I just starved to death, but I probably won't. It's been at least 18 years of hell, as I was spotted saying that I was nothing as early as the age of 2, and it feels like who I am is just this.

"Being Okay With Retreat I have these bad days where things simply do not work. It usually revolves around poor sleep. I know there are tons of good sleeping habits to follow but my main issue is I have this chronic nasal problem that can unexpectedly prevents me from sleeping because I can't breathe. I've been dealing with it for years. That mixed with pretty severe anxiety and depression keep me up at night and make relaxation extremely difficult. 


I have these frequent days where I am just useless. I do nothing productive, accomplish nothing, and get trapped in a state between being too exhausted to do anything yet unable to sleep. I try to go easy on myself and basically excuse these times as unavoidable, but they make me feel so pathetic. I start to hate myself and beat myself up. Sometimes those feelings become really intense to the point of self destruction.


I had a serious suicidal period earlier this year and because my judgement was so cloudy and my emotions so high, I said and did lots of things I regret. I didn't take care of myself properly and acted like a fuckin weirdo with no self awareness. I drove people away and those that were kind to me (entirely new people I met online) I pushed all kinds of intense dramatic stuff onto. I regret lots of choices I made because my judgement was so impaired, and still is. 


It's become a daily habit to dwell on those poor choices. When I'm sleep deprived especially, I'm extra hard on myself. I feel so pathetic because of how I am, my brain just keeps attacking me involuntarily. If I don't keep it in check I start to feel suicidal again. When I have the energy and drive to be productive it's not as bad, but even then ""productive"" to me is held to a far lower standard than normal .


I try to be okay with retreating, but I can only retreat so far until I'm just at zero. I can't tell to what extent I'm coping with poor health or just enabling my own flaws. When I beat myself up I can't tell if I'm evening out my poor qualities or just hurting myself with harsh criticism. I don't know how to be okay with being pathetic yet I don't have the constitution to fix myself either. I'm too old to keep excusing myself and although I'm making progress it's at a snail's pace.

"18 Year Old Me Would Have Found My Life at 25 Unacceptable With each and every new mistake or disappointment that comes my way, I'm astounded by how much I'm willing to let myself deteriorate.

I was really excited about my program when I started it and it feels like if I drop it I'll just disappoint everyone, myself included and will regret it once I'm in a decent headspace. Never mind the fact that I have no idea what I would do instead. And I need to do something; I can't just hibernate in my room all day like I have been doing during Christmas break. It feels like right now the only option is to suck it up and just finish my program, which feels like it's bringing me closer and closer to actually killing myself rather than just fantasizing about it. I don't know how to properly weigh pros and cons of any actions when depression is skewing the weights of everything. Any advice for how to rationally make decisions when I feel so irrational?

"Feeling pathetic I just kind of want to get this out of my mind right now. I've been feeling incredibly pathetic lately because of my suicidal thoughts. Not because of the thoughts themselves, but because the reason is just this girl. I fell in love with her over the summer, but we got into a fight in August and didn't talk until October again. During the summer we would talk everyday for hours and hours, but now she makes me feel worthless. It's like I'm not even a second thought to her. I'm like some kind of fucking pity case to her too, because my depression is so much more intense than hers and my past was so rough. Tbh at times I wish I never met her, I haven't been this bad in years. I feel starved of human connection, but I know that's not true at all. She makes me so tempted to go back to numbing myself with pain killers. I just don't understand, why does she makes me feel this way even though I've overcome so much more? Suicide always felt like it was gonna be my end, but I feel like I'm rushing towards it now. I'm probably not going to do it anytime soon, but the drugs are a more likely option atm.",Depression

"Extreme skepticism is what's killing me Whenever I talk to my brother I am surprised by how similar we are in our thoughts and feelings. Yet he never struggled with depression and managed to reduce his anxiety. How? He reads self-help books and watches motivational Youtubers. He believes that it works.

To me, every time I hear or read something that tries to be in any way motivational I immediately become skeptical and unable to believe any of it because it all sounds like the same drivel. My bullshit meter is broken because I sense bullshit everywhere. The advice given is always either so specific and sure of itself or extremely vague that it can't really be credited for any potential progress.

I wish I could be inspired by something. I wish I could be convinced that there is a way out of this mess. But every time someone comes up with an idea I dismiss it because it sounds like bullshit to me. **Because it relies on me believing that it works in the first place.**",Depression

"Lonely and depressed over wasting my youth I'm 21 and in my last year of college in Ireland and I'm in a massive rut right now. I have acquaintances sure, but no real friends and things have been like this for years. I've been battling depression and social anxiety since I was 15 and just general insecurity for who knows how long. I have a stutter, and my attitude towards it was absolute denial and shame. I subsequently avoided social situations and I developed social anxiety. I got bullied back in secondary school which made me feel even more self-conscious and even more of an outsider. So I lost my friends and isolated myself over the course of secondary school, isolated myself in the year between when I graduated and started college, and I've gone through college so far just feeling hugely lonely and isolated. My course is a pretty large one and no one really uses class for socialising. Due to a shortage of accommodation in city I go to college in, I rented a room in this woman's house in my first year and I spent a lot of the time afterwards staying in hostels. I stayed in a house with 3 others for the 2nd semester of my 2nd Year, but I was too depressed and insecure to actually bond with my housemates and their friends even though I got on with pretty much all of them. I'm now renting a room in a woman's home and there's other housemates, but no one really talks to each other ugh.   


I did speech therapy and CBT recently which allowed me to accept my stutter and overcome my social anxiety but now I've been hit with what feels like the worst bout of depression I've had to date. I've solved the main thing that plagued me all this time but I can't move on. It feels I've been hiding away for so long and only recently I got out and saw the consequences and disorder my actions and attitude have caused, and I've no idea how to repair the damage. I'm not as self-loathing as I used to be and I'm more self-accepting, which ironically has made me realise the reality of the situation I am in now. I have so far done nothing special with my life while my peers are (most of the time) enjoying themselves and making memories. I'm more sociable now, but as a male with relatively little stories and experiences to tell I would feel inferior if I was put in a story-exchanging conversation. I've wasted so many opportunities, so much time. I'm still a virgin, and I've never had a girlfriend but for a long time I never had an interest because I wanted to be asexual due to guilt when I used to be religious. I sort of dated before but everything ended terribly due to my ""issues"".  


Is there any way to make friends and end this loneliness even though I'm in my final semester of college? I dread the future ahead, because life gets more serious and that to me is when youth is over. It'll be harder to make friends as I try to settle myself into a 50 year long grind. Right now is the best time for me to set my path right, but it's already hard currently.",Depression

I was just floating with my own abruptive thoughts. I've been in this state for a few days now and I can't function. I dont know what the fuck is wrong with me.

"I guess I need some advice... So a bit of background I guess is the best the place to start. 

I'm 18, just finishing up highschool. I live with my mom and I have a younger brother (16). I used to go to therapy, but we had to stop last year because it was expensive and we couldn't afford it.

Lately my brother has been out if control. He smokes weed everyday, he is failing two classes and getting low grades in the rest, he lies, I know he has done other drugs too. He even got so drunk a couple weekends ago that he had to be carried home by his friend and I had to  watch him all night. He is often violent, aggressive, defenesive, and disobedient. I know he has his own issues (I believe with depression) but refuses to go to therapy for it. He thinks his behavior is normal and fine. He's been a handful to deal with and my mother is constantly worried about him. 

I on the other hand am suffering a lot on my own. I am extremely depressed, think about killing myself everyday, I have no friends left I really care about and that care about me, I have zero motivation to do anything in my life anymore (hobbies and homework etc.), I never have any energy, I can barely wake up in the morning. Everyday I come home from school I binge eat so much that it hurts and then I sleep until my family gets home. Sometimes I will touch my homeworm, many days I don't.

I guess my question is, what do I do? I hate to have a pity party for myself but I'm not sure how much longer I can go on like this. I don't want to tell my mom these things because I don't want her to worry anymore than she does, but on the other hand I need something because I can't tell this stuff to anyone. I need therapy or medicine or something... We don't have much money, and I dont wanna be a burden to my mother by telling her this. I think I'm.being repetitive, but I honestly just don't what options I have. 

Any ideas would help, thank you so much.... &lt;3",Depression

It is SO much work to be happy and I just get such a deep, deep tiredness from trying to keep it up. Don't know why I am posting this.

It's like I dont have an active desire to die, but I also dont care enough about my health to provide my body with what It needs.

"I need help with my girlfriend (20) Hello,
I am posting here because I need help and advice for my girlfriend and I have no experience with depression and I hope someone here can help us. 

So my girlfriend and I have been together for almost 3 years and have lived together for the majority of that. Our relationship has always been great. We go on dates all the time, travel the country, have 2 beautiful kitties, and we love each other tremendously. 

She has always suffered from depression and anxiety but within the past 6 months, it's gotten worse, way worse. She is practically emotionless, says she doesn't feel love anymore, she doesn't enjoy the things that she used to and her sex drive is gone. 

We have gone to the doctor and they put her on some medication and it was helping a bit but not as well as her or the doctors were hoping. They upped the dosage and she's worse now. She's always mad, fights with me over very little things, and is wanting to break up with me. 

She wants to end things and move back in with her mom because her mom has gone through depression and my girlfriend thinks she can help her. I've tried telling her that everything she is feeling is side effects of the medication and we have an appointment for her doctor on Thursday to try a new regimen of pills. The doctor has recommended her to a therapist but my girlfriend refuses to go. 

How can I help her? I see her spiraling out of control and she doesn't seem open to the idea of getting real professional help. What do I do? Do I just let her go and hope she starts feeling herself again? I am lost and I need advice please.",Depression
"Is it ever gonna end? Been almost 2 years since I first noticed my depression, at some points I thought it was getting better but it just seems to be getting worse or stays the same old boring empty numb way. I got to spend christmas with my family, celebrated new years with the few friends I have and it was fun, now Im just back at home dreading waking up in the moring. Im not even sure why I feel this way anymore, Im 17 with literally everything in life ahead of me but it feels like there is nothing I can do to escape this, it all feels like a bland tunnel leading to my death and who knows how long I'll have until then, maybe it'll end sooner than it was intended to. It never gets better, only for a moment in time that I'll feel happy, then that moment passes and I still feel the same way. Like it'll never get better whatever I do. Alone with my thoughts and everything. In theory this has been a great end to the year but it just feels bad and this first day of the new year feels bad too",Depression
"I don't know what to do anymore  Every day feels the same. It's like I do the same things every day and nothing changes and it's making me miserable. I wake up, make breakfast, watch some youtube, start to study for like 1-2 hours then I start to loose focus and dick around on youtube or instagram, make something to eat. Study again for maybe 2 hours, but not really efficiently, watch some Youtube again. Prepare for the gym, go to the gym. There I see my old roommate, whom I told that I had feelings for her and she afterwards started completely ignoring me. When I'm at the gym she's always trying not to look at me and ignoring me, until she can't ignore me anymore, because she's doing an exercise right next to me  or something else and then she says hello to me. I know, that I fucked the situation up in the past between us, but I just couldn't not tell her my feelings, Idk what happened there to me, my body just needed to do that, Idk, I felt so alive when I told her about my feelings. I was just so happy when we talked and went to the gym together, it just felt so right, Idk. But now everything changed, because I fucked it up. I have no one to talk to in the evening, my new roommate is not there most of the time and he also started acting a bit weird towards me. Idk what I'm doing wrong at the moment, but everything is falling apart. I cut the contact to my sis, to which I originally had a good relationship with, but she did some things, which I just couldn't justify anyone doing and just had to cut all connections to her. My father started drinking again and is always full of hatred. My mom is slowly dying because she has ALS, eventhough she is really young and it just breaks my fucking heart seeing such a nice person slowly rotting away, never having done the things she wanted to do and I can't make her dreams come true, because I'm living on my own and have nearly no money left for anything. But that's a lie, I just can't stop spending money for food that I need for the gym, because it is making me so happy going to the gym, it's like the only constant in my shitty life. I just can't sacrifice the things I already have for potentially better things, because since I tried to make something more out of the relationship I had with my old roommate and it didn't work out, I feel like I just can't decide on anything anymore. I could save money and buy my mom maybe a last trip, but I don't know what she wants and she won't tell anyone, what she wants to do. I could change the subject I'm mayoring in, because I sometimes really hate it, but I don't, because what if the other subjects also don't work out? What if I don't get a job with the other subject? What if I just started to talk to my old roommate again and try to warm up our relationship again? What if she rejects me again? I would be the fool again and she isn't doing any approaches towards me and is clearly showing me, that she doesn't want to talk to me, but then again, when we talked recently it was almost like in the old times, but I probably just can't distinguish a person from being just nice to me and letting me off gently and actually liking me. I just hate social interactions the last few months since I'm only living with my new roommate and not with 4 others anymore. I just feel so alone, alienated from everyone and I can't muster up the courage to start anything, do the things I want to do in my life. I'm just slowly letting life crush me and my will to live. I'm also slowly losing contact to my friends from my hometown and we just can't seem to do anything, because we all have different timetables. Also I just can't seem to find new friends here, except for maybe 3 people here, to which I talk to in the lectures, but I'm also not really trying, because I just never really learned how to do that, because I had nearly no friends my whole life. I tried to be really positive last year, read some books about depression, 10 rules to life from Jordan Peterson and tried to make changes in my life but I slowly just don't have the energy anymore to fight all this shit back that is currently happening, because I can't make decisions and sacrifice my shitty life for the opportunity to improve my life. I'm so fucking pathetic. I'm constantly thinking about her, about my mom and about me not doing the things in life I want to do. Everytime I cook something the eat for me, what I actually really enjoy, since I'm also working at a restaurant, I just think about just cutting my wrists and just let everything go. It would be so much easier to do, but again I don't want to ruin my body, because I really like to train and I don't want to lose my ability to do that, since it's the only thing in life I really enjoy. I'm just so fucking pathetic, I don't want to do anything anymore and just die, but I'm too afraid to do so and I just don't want to hurt my mom, since she also tried to kill herself 3 times already and she is just so a wonderful, caring person and she doesn't deserve it to see her pathetic son kill himself, since I'm the only one in our family who actually has his life together, even though I just don't see it that way.

"Do you ever feel it coming? For the last week, since Christmas Eve, I've been in somewhat of a haze, where the world barely feels real. I slept for the majority of the time during this, as I usually do when it happens. I met up with my friends for new year, and over the last night I felt gradually like I was returning to normal, and spent the most part of today feeling relatively upbeat, thinking about the future, tidying and sorting out the mess I left over the last week. But then I just stopped, I can feel that abyss there in my mind, the bad thoughts slowly creeping in and fucking with me, I just stopped and held my head in my hands.

I need this job badly and I should not have missed so much work. I hate that i'm only feeling like i've fucked up now and I should have been more motivated. I've tried hard, I really have. I just don't want to exist anymore and I'm probably going to lose everything if i lose my job.

"Help So r/humansbeingbros showed me some cool stuff about people in subreddits helping each other through tough stuff and I know lots of people are browsing the internet feeling alone and they just don't know what to do. I know they feel such a way that no wlrda can adequately describe their depths of pain and misery and anger they feel because they are alone or overwhelmed or they just feel incomplete. I feel that way to.

For me it's relationships. I've had some meaningful ones but I've been alone for a couple years now and I've taken on a more active role in trying to date. However years and years of failure or rejection lead you to stop thinking its just the other person, you stop thinking maybe she just isn't my your type or she is just to immature right now and begin to think maybe it's your fault. Maybe you are hideous or a bad person but you try your best. But trying your best doesn't help when you lie awake and alone at night with your thoughts.

I've been through pain and misery and when my friends are hurting I tell them I understand and I genuinely believe they believe that I do. But I don't really feel like I can talk to the guys about how miserable I am. I don't know why I gravitate towards girls for that (a discussion for another time).

So here I am making my first ever substantial post and it's long and rambling because I don't really know how else to ask for help. And because I want help after so long I also want to help others who feel this way.

I've gone to a lot of places just to find human contact. Dating sites and apps, messaging people on Facebook, apps specifically made to help people, hell I've even gone to adult chat rooms just so someone would want to communicate with me but it either results in failure or in something that isn't real.

It wasn't great, but it wasn't awful. I went out for the first time without my best friend (someone I recently realized I can't rely on) and meet some new people (knowing me I will never speak to them again but whatever).

"First time posting here. Looking for some advice and motivation (if possible) Hi, I'm 23, studying medicine in fifth grade. I'm striving with depression and anxiety for over six or seven years. Things are getting worse year by year and in recent months even more. I think I've been underestimating the problem; blaming my type of character, my financial state, the inability to stay in a relationship ( and getting out of them hurt most of times), my family struggles etc... Well, the thing is that actually I DO have gone through difficult situations, combined with a very self - demanding, austere and selective character of mine... But I don't know whether, you know, the hen made the egg or vice-versa. Are my psychological problems cause some of the difficulties and making others looking larger or the tough times and the very demanding character of mine headed me straight to psychological mess?

I'm feeling depressed, alone (although I'm lucky to have very nice and supportive friends) , anxious (lately often without obvious reason), non-attractive for the opposite gender (although close people tell me I'm good-looking), motivation-less and sad that all these drag me back from thriving in medical studies and life in general. Most of times I don't like what people do, you know, especially all this self-promo stuff through social media, I can't and I don't want to be a part of this. Sometimes I'm obliged in order to find a nice girl to hang out (and I'm not successful either). I always have different taste in many things such as music, how I want to have fun etc. And I'm angry when I see that others think sometimes the way I do in such things and emotions and love but at the end they just ""follow the mass""....

About 2 years ago I was finally able to get him to talk to someone and it's been on and off until a couple months ago we found an awesome place that's been helping him.  He goes there regularly and it is helping but obviously he just didn't stop being depressed. He frequently has suicidal thoughts and sometimes goes into this thing we call spiraling. Idk if that's a real term. But he just spirals in negative thoughts. Last night we were drinking and he drank to much and that's when it all happened. He was being very loud. Yelling.

Eventually it got so bad I tried to contact his therapist and couldn't get ahold of them so he ended up being taken to the hospital. I am so upset and almost feel guilty that had to happen because I know that's something he never ever wanted. I do everything I can to help him. Unconditional love, I'm always there, always doing what he needs from me and I just feel like I can't give him enough. It's all been weighing down on me to the point where I want to break up. I can't love someone so much to constantly hear that I don't love them or care about them or don't care what happen to them. And after this I don't even know what to do. I love him so much but he never feels that. And after this I would feel guilty for leaving",Depression
"Cannot kill myself so far (although I truly believe it's the right thing to do) Hey, I don't see any point in life anymore. I'm a broken, unfixable person, really.

And when I say death is the best solution, that's what I truly believe. I don't say it's a nice solution, but the most honest one.

However, I have the problem that I just cannot kill me so far. I do not fear death itself, but the moments before. The emotional and especially physical pain when you've not lost consciousness yet.

Do you have some tips? It may sound strange, but every time I read that someone committed suicide I feel even more bad because they managed to do it and I am just a waste of atoms, I can just exist.

"What can I do to help my mom? Hello, 

I don't know if this is the right subreddit to do this. Please tell me if I am in the wrong place for this post.   


If I am on the right subreddit I would love some suggestions or anything I can do to help my mom. She has been struggling with depression for over 10 years I would say and it has never been worse in my opinion.   
She has not harmed herself directly but over the years there have been time when she has refused to eat and take care of herself which made me and my dad to somehow force her or convice her that she needs to take care of herself.   
She was in a psychiatric hospital 4 times now. The first two times she came back I saw the improvement but the last two I have seen none. When we visit her in the hospital and when we call she sounds a lot better and the doctors also think that she can go home but the second she comes back its back to old. 

I am working in a different city now and can't come home to be with her constantly anymore and my dad can't handle her anymore (he wants to help but after so many years I think he is burned out and raises his voice often when she wont cooperate). 

Every morning its the same struggle... We want her to get out of bed since its almost afternoon and she doesnt want to, we ask her to do super simple stuff (wash a couple of dishes or cleanup the table) around the house and she doesnt want to do anything, we have to force her to bathe and to keep herself clean and we have to make sure she eats every day. I have been on vacation for the last two weeks and tried talking with her but I cant seem to get trough to her. I am trying to understand what she wants and how can I help her but it just seems that she doesnt want anything and wants to leave us all and be alone. The last visit she had in the hospital she even said to my dad that she likes it there (which crushed him).

When I heard that she liked the hospital I thought that she liked the structure and knowing what she needs to do everyday. So once she came back I tried making a schedule with her of what she would do every day for a week. The day after I left to work she stopped doing anything again and just slept through the whole day again. I know my dad would get her to get out of bed but the first opportunity she would get she would go lie down again. She keeps saying that she is tired and doesnt want to do anything but when she goes to her bed she does not sleep she just lies there staring at nothing. She has friends in the neighbourhood and used to love going for coffe to her friends but she doesnt want to do that even but we convince her to go so she socializes atleast a little bit with other people then her family.

People keep saying to her that she needs to snap out of it but I understand that this is a condition that doesnt just go away and she needs to learn how to handle it and try living with it. I dont know what is happening in her head and I will probably never understand because she doesnt want to talk with me.

What can I do? Do we try to find a new hospital for her? Would weekly talks with a  psychiatrist help? I don't know what to do anymore. Any suggestions or any advice would mean a lot.

Homeless Amazon worker checking in Hello reddit! I'm back to share with you all the challenges I've faced working at Amazon and what's changed since I've quit. I deleted my previous account because the moderators kept deleting all my posts but I'm just going to try again. Pretty much I've worked at Amazon FC in Kansas City from aug 17 to Dec 15 of this year.  Throughout my entire employment there I've tried to work my way up and get trained and advanced but it just didn't happen. I ended up going on medical leave of absence the entire summer of 2018 for severe depression after the first peak season. I ended up having to live in my car because the medical leave pay is only 2/3 your pay and they still take taxes.  So my money quickly went to hotels and copay for my psychiatrist/therapist. After returning from medical leave I felt alienated and treated like a cancer cell among my managers. I ended up quitting this second peak season because I couldn't physically and mentally bare working 60 hour consecutive weeks during the holidays while sleeping in my car. I needed up just leaving to California again because I was over Amazon and the bitter Midwest cold. Immediately since I've gotten back to Cali I've scored two interviews and start training at a job at the very start of 2019. New Year's Eve I came to the realization though that I'm still miserable and that I'm going to have to suffer and be in poverty even more. That sank me into a depression and I heavily was idealizing suicide. I'm at a point right now where I feel like I'm just in survival mode and have to just keep pushing no matter how bad I feel. I attempted suicide and survived back in October and it made me really appreciate my life a bit more but it's hard to appreciate my life when Amazon has damaged me seemingly almost beyond repair. Just want everyone else that had a shit year and barely survived that's going into another year you don't really care to live in that I'm here on this hell of a planet with you.

"Stuck in a cycle I am 37 years old. I've been depressed for what feels like years now. I own my own business which I feel is currently in its death throes. My business partner has delusions of grandeur and seems to think we can make it even though we are 10s of thousands of dollars in debt and behind on almost everything. We've stopped paying our credit cards and everything nonessential and we are still struggling. 

My wife has been the breadwinner for my family for the last few years and now, after years of living off credit cards, it's finally catching up to us and we are in the same boat as our business. If we were living paycheck to paycheck, that would be a huge upgrade, but it feels like we are living day to day. 

We might have to file for bankruptcy, personally and for our business.

My wife and I used to be happy at one point. Now I feel like I can't even talk to her because I don't want to put any more burden on her than I already do. We never have sex anymore, we never connect any more, and I am pretty sure she I know why. Because of the stress I have placed on her. I stay up every night till 5-6am watching Netflix and playing video games (league, mtg arena, factorio, no man's sky), getting high (I was a night owl before I started smoking again) and getting up at 1-2pm, going to my store to work and coming home to do it all over again. I've lost 30 lbs in the last year from barely eating. I am not taking care of myself physically. I shower like once a week. I haven't shaved in weeks or cut my hair. 

I started growing my own weed a year ago to help with this feeling of depression, and it has helped to a degree, but I know the only thing that will really help is starting over again. Closing my business, getting a real job, etc. But the thought of doing that overwhelms me with feelings of hopelessness and sadness.

I don't know what I want to do anymore. Working in the field I got my degree in (IT) sounds awful. Working in any job where I have to answer to someone besides myself and my family sounds awful, but we need money.

I know what I need to do, but I have zero desire to fix it. I don't want to get some decent paying industrial job because they drug test (and what fucking business is it of theirs what I do in my off-time). I don't want to get an office job because I don't want to be just another nameless cog in the wheel of someone's money making machine. I don't want to work with the public because I can't stand people. There are so many assholes out there who don't care about anyone but themselves.

I can't deal with the state of political affairs in our country. It's so obvious to me that our govt doesn't care about us and just wants to keep us down. I feel like that's every government. I want to move to a Scandinavian country, one of those places that are listed as the best places to live and raise a family. But we can't even emigrate there because we don't have professional skills (doctor, engineer, etc)  no sponsor, and we can't seek political asylum (even though I feel like the writing is on the wall for the US).

I've thought about suicide but would never actually do it. If I could suddenly not exist, I am not even sure I could do that. But I think about it daily, and that worries me. 

I just want to stay in bed and cry. Even then, I feel like I can't tell this to my wife because even though she loves me with all her heart, it would be a burden to her and plunge her further into anxiety and depression.

I feel like this is my burden to bear. I don't want to seek professional help because we can't afford it due to how shitty our Healthcare system is. I am stuck in a cycle and don't know how to break it. I don't know what to do. Just the thought of keeping up appearances is exhausting.",Depression

"forcing myself to look at photos of open wounds on people's wrists Seeing blood and pictures of open bloody wounds has always made me cringe, but the more I have urges to hurt myself (technically I've never actually self-harmed but I think about doing it a lot), the more the idea of it satisfies me.
So what did I do last night? I looked through the hashtag #?ü¶?????Æ on Instagram (which is short for ?ü¶????ü???Æ?üü?ü? which is Japanese for wrist cutù) and just stared at pictures of people's bloody arms until I liked it. Until it didn't make me cringe. And it worked. I literally watched videos of people taking tiny cute razors and cutting into their skin until it appealed to me. Not because I like seeing other people in pain, but because that might become my reality, as horrible as I've been feeling. I have the urge to do it and I think about it a lot? I've always wanted to but I have a low pain tolerance and cringe at the sight of slices in people's skin (but not anymore!). Also, I'm afraid of my therapist seeing it and being prompted to take action on it in some kind of way.

However, with my depression and anxiety I'm scared that it won't happen. I already feel like a huge failure for not having finished school by this age or been able to financially support myself at this age.

"Everything wants to punch down. First post on this subreddit, so yay, I guess?



I try not to let out my feelings online, especially not in a place where people can dig them back up and shove them in my face. It's all becoming a bit too much, however, and I need to share them. 

The job that I enjoyed, that I thought I could turn into a career - even  if it was a grocery store - has turned into an utter nightmare. From a coworker that had started harassing me about my religion with little done about it from management to another one that told me to my face that she was trying to get me and several others fired (she was reported  to HR). Then I got sick, two weeks of illness that I tried to work through until I had to call out to let my body rest and try to recover. I  lost my voice sometimes, had fevers, flu-like symptoms, all the things you don't want around your fresh produce and chilled goods. My job decided to cut my hours from 26-36 hours a week to 10 hours.   

Finding out that I have autism this year has not helped anything. It brought up every memory of being called lazy, uncaring, damaged, etc. It also hurt my job, the meltdowns were seen as temper tantrums and coworkers grew distant, management didn't care to the point that I wound up hurting myself to stave off a meltdown prior to Christmas. When I got home I curled up in a ball and cried for hours, kicking off the depression that I've been fighting since then. 

Being on the cusp of losing my home helps nothing.

My roommate is a wonderful person but struggles with depression and her own issues after an assault. She lost her job due to illness as well. Trying to help her while dealing with my own mind is not easy and I know I shouldn't. 

After reading this it sounds more like whining then depression, feels like everything has gone numb. Want to cry but can't, to scream and tear out my hair, hide in the closet and ignore the world until my shit is tossed on the curb. There feels like there isn't a way out, that every door I try to open is locked with no key. ",Depression
"I can't decide for my life, I have to obey everything my parents dictate to me Sappy new year.

I'm 24. I live in a terrible country with terrible situations and environment. My ultimate goal in life is to first escape this country, and second to study in a decent university to become a scientist and contribute to science and technology.

It's too hard to achieve this goal. Currently, I ""have to"" attend to a really really bullshit and fake so-called ""university"" here that I hate it. I can't emphasize how much trouble I have with this ""uni"". My high school was more academic than this kindergarten that I have to waste my life and my time. So I always suffer to go there and to be there. Sometimes I even tell my parents that I'm going there, but in reality, I drive to a secluded area and contemplate about my life and my simple troubles that seem impossible to be solved.

My parents dictate to me to go there, because they want me to get a damned bachelor's degree from a fake ""uni"". I can't leave it because I'd have to go to a mandatory military service which is worse, and guess what, it'd take two bloody years.

I just don't want to continue going to this effing ""uni"". It's a total waste of everything and it makes me suicidal whenever I go there. Life is like a prison for me these days. I can't choose and decide for my life.

About 2 months ago I got out of a bad relationship and I felt so much happier, happier then ever. I was doing great up until about 2 weeks ago, I slowly started losing interest in everything.

I try and play video games but I just cant stay focused and want to lay down. Lately I just want to sleep. I have been on 2 tinder dates since being single the first one went ok, but after the breakup I told myself I wouldn't catch feelings. That rule was broken after the 2nd person I went out with. We had an amazing connection. Then shortly after meeting she had to go back to college far away. She wanted to stay in touch but shes been so busy and cant text alot. My brain is telling me she just wants nothing to do with me, even though im fairly sure thats not the case. If i wasnt already depressed this wouldnt be an issue, but it just made it worse.

I'm 18 now and I looked back at pictures of when I was in 4th or 5th grade and it just immediately felt a pit in my stomach. Nothing really mattered in life back then, I never really thought about my future. Now that I'm heading to college soon I've reflected on this a lot in the past few days. My life does not suck under any means I just felt like I was happier back then. I know growing up is a part of life but how do I move forward? ",Depression

"My mood/feelings change in minutes? So I've been having anxiety pretty bad for the last few months (haven't had it like this in years). I've also noticed that my mood changes literally within minutes. I can be happy, positive, motivated, and satisfied one moment.... then not even 5 minutes later, I'll be thinking negatively, won't be happy, I'll have no motivation to do my hobbies, ETC. This gets 3X worse whenever on LSD. I can go from strong feelings of happiness &amp; bliss to a negative headspace where I just CAN'T be positive. I'm not sure as to what this could be at all because I'm not sad and nor do I express any clinical depression symptoms besides the mood issues. Do any of you go through this? Could all of this just be something as simple as anxiety controlling my thoughts? BTW, NOT asking for any type of diagnosis... just opinions and experiences! ",Depression

"The paradoxical cycle. I've been someone with severe melancholic depression for over 14 years now, and I feel like every day I inch closer to full on loss of emotions.

"A brief moment of joy is killing me (first public feelings expressed be ez) I recently had a great weekend of work.. probably the best work experience I've ever had.  Afterward I had so much energy, felt so coherent and concise. I got a moment alone when I started to unwind and tried to remember the last time I felt like that and it made me realize how depressed I really was. That euphoria faded quickly and I went back into my head almost immediately. So this taste of happiness for just a few short hours was such a tease. I felt like I could conquer anything in those moments. And the kicker is i have no idea when this depression really started and since then have been scrambling to figure when the last time I sustained any happiness. 

This happened about two months ago and right now I'm in a hotel room. By myself. While my girlfriend is out with my family, enjoying their day. I ruined New Years with my family and got back to my hotel and then torpedoed my girlfriends mood for something separate. At this point I should mention I don't hate my life.. I hate myself.

"Break up depression It's been almost 9 months since my ex broke up and I haven't been able to completely move on. I went to the psychiatrist (I was under medication for 5 months) but I don't feel it was that useful, only medication.
A part of me analyzes the past and sees him as narcissist, he used me in order to get the company that he needed and when he got tired he dumped me (he was extremely cruel when he did so.) I think I should just forget and move on and I will eventually find someone worthy of my time and company. 
The other part of me is still holding to the past and to him. He was with the first person I thought I would be forever and he let me down. I can't let go of that feeling of dissapointment. Somedays I feel I will never be able to find somebody. 
I want to be able to let go, move on and be happy. But all I can feel is sadness. I spend ll day on Netflix and Youtube so I don't have to think.

I will be grateful if you could give me advice. Thanks

(Life Story)
Anyways I've spent most of my teen years and early 20s being depressed because everything that made me happy up to that point was either gone or changed forever. I had two best friends who were like brothers to me and we'd do everything together and liked the same thinks, age 5 - 12 was probably the last time I was actually happy. Then one of those friends moved away and the other slowly moved on from me and made new friends. Then I flunked 7th grade and pretty much started new, I joined a clique of fellow nerds and geeks but they all had friends within and outside of the group. I wasn't really friends with any of them more just we had similar interests hung out as a group from time to time. Once they started getting into relationships I stated to drift away from them and noticed that nobody seemed to care or notice I was leaving the clique. I was just in the background to them. Being lonely in 11th grade seeing everyone I knew progress through life making friends and getting into relationships while I was alone wondering the halls failing school because I just didn't care about anything anymore I dropped out because I didn't want to suffer another year of that hell.
I got a job and started saving money to pursue my dream of being a game designer and for awhile I was happy, even made a best friend who was also like a brother to me. The bond felt stronger than with my original 2 friends. However in 2015 he got a girlfriend and moved on, just like the clique. We're still friends but he's doing his thing and I'm doing mine. I got into another deep depression then I finally snapped.

My boyfriend and I haven't been together for a long time yet, but I told him about my depression, self-harm history and my panic attacks quite early in our relationship. So far I was feeling a lot better but during the holidays I fell back into my own little dark place and especially today I barely talked and wasn't really able to get myself to do something.

He was worried, especially when I told him that I worry that I've got the need to hurt myself again, even though I've been ""clean"" for about 4 months now. He promised me, that he would be there for me but admitted, that he doesn't know how he can help me. 

I worry that my depression can put a strain on our relationship, but I love him and even if sometimes I think it would be easier to give up, push him away and keep him from seeing me this way, I want to fight this mindset to be with him. 

So any advice would be appreciated on how I can help him understand me better or maybe just what your partner does when you feel really bad. I will talk to him and try to explain what I want and need, when I feel down but it would be nice to hear what others do to help their depressed partners.

I spent years working on habits in pursuit of that other version of myself. I improved many areas like my media diet, reading more, creating higher quality creative work but along the way to these changes I found myself growing apart from friend circles. As I continued to grow I often realized that many of my friends were not interested in the pursuit of these things and it made me feel alienated, friend group to friend group. They were all perfectly content with their lifestyles, where as I felt if I stayed I'd be complacent with a life I didn't want to live. It happened once in high school and once at the end of university. All these people that I spent so much time and energy with are simply not in my life anymore. It's not like I didn't want them in my life, it seems like we would just start to grow apart.

"Positive escitalopram (Cipralex/Lexapro) experiences for high-functioning individuals I might be starting 2019 off with my first anti-depressant. My GP has suggested escitalopram based on my symptoms. Over the past 3-4 months (out of no where) I have experienced a few panic attacks and very high baseline anxiety. I also experienced mid-level depression that has fluctuated to periods of major depression. 

Essentially I've begun to get anxious in normal situations (talking to co-workers) and have experienced a strong diminishment in enjoyment of normal activities (my job, sports, etc). 

I believe that multiple life events in a sort timeframe have created this situation (marriage, new home, new job - within a 12 month period). 

I'm looking for any experiences that high-functioning individuals have had on this anti-depressant. What I mean by ""high-functioning"" are just people that are actually working full-time jobs, have a supportive family, have friends and interests outside of work, are eating correctly, are working out and taking care of their bodies, are not abusing drugs, etc. As the research I have done suggests that SSRIs work significantly better for those in a high-functioning state, but in a depressed/anxious state.

They've gone on a trip to Australia/NZ for 3 weeks which is wonderful, but time zones make things tricky (I'm in the UK, so it's almost opposite time and I'll only get them in the late evening, really) and I don't want to be a downer on them while they're on holiday anyway. 

This is compounded by my uni friends being away for the winter break, so another part of my support network is gone. 

What can I do to minimise the damage of losing a huge chunk of my support network for a few weeks? I don't know what to do. Sorry if this is a pointless post.",Depression

"Now that my deep suicidal depression is gone, I can distill it down to a single willful delusion of the mind. When I was a teenager, I conditioned myself to believe I could not be good. I willfully adopted the belief that I deserves no good things, that good things should and would not happen to me, that I was a negative force in every other person's life. My self-image became a black hole. The mistakes were deeply highlighted, triumphs excused or ignored. Love rejected due to deep loathing of self. Absolute, complete disbelief that someone could feel love for me.

Now I see it for what it was. I always was scared I was delusional, but I was scared of thinking good of myself and that that was delusional. What a paradoxical delusion. And the worst part was that it was locked solely to my existence, nobody else could see that. Only the thing on the outside I so deeply loathed being.

Now I can still feel the coursing empty coldness radiating from my heart, I still feel hatred for myself. I'm working on it, it's a slow process. But I just don't get wrapped up in those thoughts anymore.

 I feel for anyone in their holes. The hole, though, deepens the persona and it gives you better potential for the future. No matter where you are, you can turn your pain into it's inverse, great joyousness. I love you, and I want you all to thrive in the new year. I hope I could help someone somehow.",Depression

"How long did you try going to a certain therapist for before realizing it was doing nothing but draining your energy and bank account, and how has your view on therapy as an option evolve? I've been through a couple of different CBT pros, each for a little over 6 months. None have been able to ?crack' me even though I was completely on board and trying to cooperate. I've been offered to start medications but I would honestly rather just kill myself rather than live on happy pills. Currently nearing that 7 month mark with my current shrink and every week it becomes more of a chore that I just know in advance is going to be a waste of time, the 30 minute bike ride, the 50 minute silent/small talk session, and the 30 minute ride back - leaving me more exhausted and feeling like I would be better off just trying to settle and get used to the way things are, and learn to live with it or just wait till everyone who cares about me dies so I can go out peacefully myself.",Depression
"Lacking courage/motivation I'm going on holiday to a hot country in July, not that I had the courage to actually say no to my family who just assumed I would just come along. I self harmed for a few months last year and stopped before I realized I was cutting deeper and deeper and I didn't want to become addicted or require medical attention. The scars won't fade by July so my only choice is to hide them.

I found out that here in the UK we can get waterproof makeup that hides scars and other skin conditions prescribed to us by our GPs after going to a clinic for an appointment where they determine the best colours to use and teach you how to apply it. I actually felt excited, my heart was beating faster thinking about how I would be able to go out in the summer without sweating buckets under long sleeves, I would be able to go on that holiday without my family finding out about my scars, I could go swimming, I could even just walk around the house comfortably without fear of anyone else in the house seeing my scars.

But I don't know my NHS number or GP information. The only way for me to find out is to go to the medical centre I'm signed up to and ask. And then I have to drive to another town for the appointment to find the best colours and learn to apply the makeup. And then I have to make an appointment with the GP to approve of the prescription request, and he doesn't even have to accept it if he doesn't want to. It's so scary. I've never done anything like this before and now I have to do the first adult-like thing since turning 18 about two months ago almost entirely by myself.

"Cry To Bring In The New Year It's 9 minutes passed New Years, and the first thing that comes into my head is, One year closer to my suicide.ù

It's been years now since I began having this heavy belief that my life is worth nothing. That I'll die before my 18th birthday. Year: 2021. The anxiety that that day is coming haunts me, but the worse anxiety of imagining all the Sh*t I'm gonna go through before I even get there is what drags me down most.
By now people are commonly reminding me of all the things that I should be prepared for: Hey, Hey. When're you getting your learners? Can't wait too long or you won't be able to get your license! Hey! Looked for a job yet? Heyo! What do you plan to do after Highschool? Remember Kiddo! We're kicking you out on your 18th birthday! C'mon now! Save your money! You'll get no where in life if you go blowin' it all!ù
YES. I KNOW! I UNDERSTAND! I GET IT! PLEASE!
Please just stop. Please. I can't handle it anymore.

I can't get my Learners because of the crushing fear that I'll fail.
I can't get a job because of the haunting whispers that I'll be rejected.
I can't think about moving out because I can't even support myself under this roof I'm under.
Instead I starve myself, dehydrate myself, cut myself, hate myself.
Because that's all I've ever been able to do right.
Hell, who knows. I might not even be able to finish Highschool.
All I'm ever told is, You're fine! You'll do well, you'll make it.ù Ignoring the way my mind works, and just trying to push aside my problems without stepping into my shoes.
How would you react if I said I hurt myself? That I want to DIE. That no matter what I do, I'll never become ANYTHING. Huh? What would you do?

Anything at all?

"Dont know what to do Long story but im gonna try to keep it short.

Im 25yo since I have memory my dad was never there (he probably went to buy cigarettes). A lot of shity moments and also great moments of my life happened during all those years. As you can imagine i would feel like shit when i saw my friends hanging out with their dad either learning how to hunt, how to do bbq and simple stuff like that.. I would be jealous. My mom would be always working and making everything work out for us.. It took me years to just move on and forget about my dad not being there.

I met my wife when i was 20 she was my best friend back in the day and one of the only persons that knows how i feel about all these dad issues and all the shity stuff that i went through. We worked everything out and we got married when we got to 23yo but we were having some economic trouble wich of course i neveeer asked my mother to help me out.. I decide to join the Army i leave her behind and go to all those trainings everything went smoothly i come back and BOOM all of a sudden my dad found us. My wife decided for her that maybe it was a good idea for me to finally meet him. I didnt like the idea at first but I thought it was time to act like an adult and just go and see whats the deal.

I met him and he was acting like nothing happened at all and would invite to family dinners and would introduce me to a lot of uncles, cousins and even step brothers. He had a real big family and a big table too... This went on for two years as i tried to maybe create something out of it. But i never felt something for him or either got attached i was just fake smiling and would accept a quick chat with him.. This year i stopped and told him that i dont want to be part of him anymore it wasn't working out for me. At least i tried but didnt work. I couldn't stop thinking of the way he was acting like nothing happened at all. Or hes family would act like they were always there out for me.. I broke down. Im full of rage towards him and didnt wanted to do something i would regret.

These past holidays i tried to open up with my boss and he told me i was gonna regret doing that to my dad because he lost his dad and wishes to see him again.

My mother in law would try to convince me to talm to him again because she lost her mom and misses her.

People are making me feel like im the bad person here and it confuses me. I always do what i feel right for me but this time im not sure whats right. If i keep talking to him is bad for me, i try opening up to people and they make me feel bad about it. This is bringing problems to my relationship now because my wife told me i was killing the family vibe at their holiday gathering. I feel like shit all this happened yesterday.

It cant be right... Talk to him and feel like a hypocrite? Hold my problems to myself? I dont know.... I want to stop feeling like this",Depression
"I can't live without him and have no future When I say this, I mean it. I'm not being overly pessimistic. 

He was the man I loved, and my best friend. He was everything I could possibly want in a person. We had an amazing connection, but he cut me off because he couldn't have a relationship with someone who has children (I do) and was adamant that cutting me off would help us shut our feelings. This literally happened overnight. No grey period between great and awful. Months are passing, and I cannot seem to go on. I think about him all the time.

I've been through another heartbreak in my life, and I'm not a kid anymore. But this is just very, very different. I'm a grown woman, and I know the weight this has, and will have on me.

Besides, I have no future whatsoever. Mid 30s, with children, I don't even have the strength to be the strong mother I should be for them. I can barely function.
There will not be other relationship, as it's just impossible to find people interested in single mothers where I live. And if there will be any, it will be only to fill a void, or not be lonely, which I KNOW I will still be depressed and thinking about it.

Death is a luxury to me because I am a parent. There is just no hope for me. I pray that I die every day, because I can't chose to kill myself.

"Nothing excites me anymore and I'm slowly losing the will to live As a teenager, I had a lot going for me. I played the guitar and was really good, I had a lot of friends, and I was excited by simple things like going to the mall or getting chipotle with friends and calling it an adventureù. However, I didn't do well in school, mostly got C's and D's. I wasn't even planning on going to college anyways because I had these wild dreams for a music career, so I didn't care about that at all. My music made me happy and that was all that mattered to me. My parents and teachers eventually clipped my wings and ruined that dream for me by telling me that music isn't a real profession and I'm just gonna end up in my parents' basement for the rest of my life. I was forced to apply to college and pick a major on the fly, so I chose teaching because I thought that was what all the people who didn't know what to do with their lives majored in. 

Long story short, college ruined me, I only have one friend who often gets mad at me and stops talking to me, I stopped playing the guitar for almost 3 years, and nothing makes me happy anymore. It's just an endless cycle of go to work, go to class, fuck around on the Internet for a couple hours, go to bed, repeat. 

I wanted to break out of this cycle so I planned this crazy weekend in the city for my 21st a few months ago and my friend and I had the time of our lives. I truly felt happy and excited for once. A couple weeks ago, I impulsively bought tickets for a concert for the first time in four years because I figured life's too short and it actually made me really happy. It even inspired me to get back into music.

I then had a lightbulb go off in my head and thought it's not too late to establish a music careerù so I practiced every day. Unfortunately, I'm nowhere near as good as I used to be no matter how hard I try. I started to feel discouraged and went back to putting my dreams aside.

I keep trying to get out of the house but no one else wants to. Every time I hang out with my boyfriend, all he wants to do is play video games while I sit and watch, and my only friend never wants to go out anymore because she'd much rather watch Netflix and order delivery every day. I feel like life's just such a letdown right now and I can never get happy. 

I'm seriously considering just transferring to a school in a different state and starting over from scratch, so I applied to a few. But I'm also afraid that I'm just gonna end up alone and it won't make any difference where I live. 

Am I crazy to think I can fix this? Because I feel like my entire generation doesn't care about seeking out happiness and would much rather settle for a life of watching netflix and going on social media 24/7, but I don't want to live like that anymore. ",Depression
"5-HTP combined with L-Tyrosine? Will it make me emotionally numb as SSRI and decrease memory and cognition? Hi. In 2014 I started feeling extremal depression, and in 2015 I was prescribed Escitalopram (SSRI). I was taking it for 1 year, and it was giving me tons of side effects: memory decline (and I always had good memory before), keeping me very sleepy and tired during the day, loss of emotions (no good, no bad, just flat, I even stopped being afraid of horror movies though usually before was very sensitive). My doc was saying that it is because of depression, and I am exaggerating. So, for 1 year I was taking it, and then I dropped almost cold-turkey (i was a bit lucky in that period as I changed the countries, met new people and was experiencing new things, but still didn't feel the life fully so I decided to stop taking AD). 
So since 2016 I am off any AD, still depressed and not excluding the external factors. Memory and cognition kinda got better, but I don't think it is fully back to how it was before. Feelings feel like flat still. Can feel euphoria or can feel nothing in the situations where I suppose to feel. Also, I don't exclude the possibility of me being bipolar, but my psychotherapeut doesn't think I am. Also, I think I may have ADHD because of problems with focus and concentration and extreme procrastination. Can be result of depression though, but I don't know.

Recently read that 5-HTP + L-tyrosine may help with depression. I am going to start taking them, but I wonder whether 5-HTP gives you the same shit feeling of flat emotions and of a bubble? Also, how does it work for memory and focus? 

What I really want is to feel. To feel again. Not only pain, but good things, to immerse into the life, into the situations. So far, I only feel estranged and still in some kind of bubble. And also concerned of its effect on memory. 

Would like to hear from someone who takes 5-HTP combined with L-Tyrosine.

I havent been doing anything meaningful for the whole year. I enjoy watching movies without switching on my brain and just put foods in my mouth, without paying attention to movie details. I like comedy shows, so i tend to watch a lot of them, just to make myself feel good. I have no motivation to do anything, i was a Masters student but right now i doze off so quickly when reading long winded materials. Not even video games could excite me anymore, i would play the game for a while and then feel sleepy and just quit the game. After that, i would go to youtube and just play meaningless videos. Perhaps the most dedicated things ive done were getting foods when i am super hungry.  


I dunno why im always sleepy (not really tired but when it comes to serious stuff, i would doze off), but feeling awake at night, so i would lie down in my bed watching videos. I do have a job, but its a repetitive job that I would do it just for the money, so that i could buy stuff that excites me for a while and then regret it after.

"My Intermittent Explosive Disorder is relapsing. I know it may seem like it has nothing to do with depression but it is triggered by it.  Stress, existential dread, being antagonized by someone, and being miserable in general brings out my violent tendencies.  Last week at the gym, some asshole in a wheel chair scolded me at the gym because I was in his mirror space despite the fact that he was not even doing a set and to top it all off, he was doing dumbbell overhead press which you don't need a mirror for.  He pissed me off so much that I'm still angry about it.  Its a good thing he was a paraplegic or else I would've punched him right in the fucking face.  I'm also stressing about what I should do after college graduation and this online training I have to do is absolutely fucking impossible.  I have broken so much stuff, punched so many holes in and have thrown so many objects across the room in my life because of my temper tantrums and I have very little control over it.

"I thought a lot about suicide last night The alcohol probably had a significant impact, but last night was the first time I've ever seriously considered killing myself.  I've been miserable for a while now, and I often think about it in passing, never fully convincing myself that this could ever be a viable option, and would cause more harm than good.



I was over at a friend's house for New Year's Eve, and the past couple times I've hung out with them, I've felt extremely isolated - like I'm still waiting to meet my *real* friends, or something, and the ones I have now are just placeholders. But honestly, I can't imagine ever coming close to convincing another person that we're similar - at least not similar enough for them to want to hang out. It doesn't help that I may be the only true introvert of the group.



I'm only 18, and my age might be the only thing I have right now, but time passes so quickly. Anyway, I digress. I remember thinking about how I would do it and the family members that would be hurt the most. Usually, the latter convinces me it won't work, but last night it didn't. I concluded that it would be in my best interest to commit suicide. Even just typing all of this out, it sounds so sweet. Disappearing, evaporating, dissipating. Me and my mind's chemical imbalances thrown into the abyss.



Needless to say, these feelings have survived my drunkenness, and the idea still lingers powerfully. I'm not sure what to do.",Depression
"Recovery can be a bitch I really don't have any reason to be writing or for posting this.
It's been a pretty good couple of weeks since I last had anything to say, medications seemed to be doing their job. Therapy and peer support seem to be having some benefit as much as I want to struggle against it. Everything just seemed to be trending in the right direction. I managed to make it through the Christmas plight relatively unharmed. 
New Years is has always been the death knell of the holiday slog, something to at least hold onto knowing that after this it's all over.

Not this year. This year out of nowhere I was utterly blindsided with uncontrollable sorrow and an impulse for self harm that I haven't felt in years. As a result I drank far more than I had intended, while laying in bed in the dark by myself. I did manage to force myself to fall asleep as to avoid the voice screaming in my head. Because it's not real, none of this should hold any power.

I woke up this morning, feelings are a little more tepid. Nothing to be heard but a ringing in my ears. I could throw my hands up in defeat and continue to let things come crashing down. The other option is to force myself out of bed and into the shower and accept that the road to recovery isn't a linear one. There will be times when you guaranteed set backs but you can put the work in and get over them.

Even when things are good, when I'm ""enjoying myself"" it's just the concept of enjoyment based upon other people's understanding of what contentment is meant to be.

I always feel it deep down.
Every day my mind is silently saying over and over again that all I want is peace
The peace of death
It's always there inside
Wanting peace
Wanting to die 
Peace
Death
Peace
Death
Kill me
Fucking set me free, please

Being alive is just waiting for things to happen with an expectation that it will be good when it comes, then realizing the best part was the waiting with high expectations only to be let down again and again.

It seems like the whole point of living is investing energy into something that means nothing. Pretending insignificant things have meaning, when in reality they only have significance because you gave it to them in the first place.

I don't enjoy living.
Even when it's as good as it can get, better than expected. It's a constant daily struggle. A quiet struggle deep in my head. 

Every day, every moment is struggle. A struggle to pass time. An effort to make other people's experience better.

Every night and morning the only thing stopping me from ending my life is other people. Existing for other people. Even the success I search and work for in life is just to legitimise my existence when in reality my existence is just for other people.

I hate myself
I hate my life
I want to die so fucking much it hurts

I don't want to have to deal with myself or my life anymore

I live with constant exhaustion.

The exhaustion of constantly turning over my history. Jumping from formative scene to formative scene for clues into my present pathologies, sexual and otherwise; the pain of constructing meaning from the scraps of a life seemingly bereft of one; the chore of managing my mood with pills, never quite sure if either are working; and the strain of having to engage with other people outside of my own horrid mind on top of it all.

Engaging with people seems to be a temporary cure, a way to escape my thoughts and focus on someone else's. A way to get outside myself. But it is temporary. As quickly as the consuming thoughts about other people come - they go. They leave as I realize it has nothing to do with me. No one cares that I've put all my energy into their issues. As relationships go on people just expect it from me more and more. To the point where I can't ever fill others expectations of me.

I never establish myself as a person with my own needs and feelings. In every relationship with others I establish myself as someone who can be there for them. Who can listen and allow them to be introspective about their needs. See them from other angles. No wonder people like me. No wonder I'm so ""popular"". Really, it's not me they like. They like themselves. They like the good parts of themselves that I affirm. They like the parts of themselves that I help uncover and keep safe. It has nothing to do with me. I'm just another body floating along. Being a side part in people's lives. A character. Whatever they think of me as.

I'm such a fucking character 

Im not a real person at all

Why do I sit here quietly thinking these things all day and all night. Why do I have to suffer so much emotionally. 
Why do I feel so alone when I'm so ""social"". When I have such a great support network of family and friends. 

Why is it that I can't properly express myself to others???? 

I see people express themselves to me all the time.

I want to die
I want to hurt
I want to feel the physical pain that I quietly feel on the inside all the time. The pain I ignore.
I want it to be a bruise or a cut or anything physical 
Anything real
None of this is ""real"" 
It's just inside my head
It's just my mind
It's just me
Which is why the only way I can think to deal with it is by letting it all go
Letting myself go
Letting myself die

I know I won't follow though with this happy life I try to tell myself could happen 

IT WONT HAPPEN

I have been given everything I could possibly want or ask for. A creatively fulfilling job. A caring family. An amazing partner that I love. More friends than I deserve.
It's like life is throwing obstacles at me. Obstacles of privilege. Obstacles between me and what I really need to do which is not exist anymore.

"When you are told to 'get help' for mental illness I have manic depression and I'm getting the notion there is no real help my problem. Everything is just a band aid. I been to several therapists, been hospitalized multiple times, and gone through 20+ different meds in the past 10 years. I have challenged the voices in my head and looked at rational outcomes. I have also been verypositive. I exercise every day and eat a strictly healthy diet, take meds to sleep longer, and anything else in my power to try and improve my life. .I have been doing all this and yet I still have crippling depression. I'm convinced there is no help out there anymore.",Depression
"Just fuck I thought I was getting on top of this, I haven't had a depressive episode in a few weeks now. Today I woke up and just felt numb. I couldn't stop thinking about killing myself. My mind kept coming up with all these reasons as to why I should just do it and whenever I get like this, if I try to think about something else I start to hear this shrill scream in my head that won't go away until I let the thoughts start pouring in again. It's hell, it feels like a never ending cycle until it gets interrupted by another sound like music, or TV, or my person. I was lucky my person came and interrupted it today without even knowing that it was going on. But I don't know how to even tell him about this or that I should. I just feel like I'm lost sometimes and I don't know what to do. I just hate when the thoughts come back.",Depression
"Some thoughts on the season... So, lurked here for a long time, commented, but never posted.  We've made it through another one.  Not even sure how i feel about that.  In years past January always seemed to bring a sense of relief, like I got through another holiday season with my sanity (relatively) intact.  All the inner turmoil that comes with this time of year seems to take a heavy toll.  Guilt, shame, inadequacy, hopelessness all rear their ugly heads in December.  But usually, come January, i can sit back and say ""i made it, i survived my demons.""  This year they are not so easily beaten it seems.  The doubt lingers, the self-hatred hasn't subsided.  They are defiantly persisting and I can't say why.  Maybe its the realization that they are always with me, that the holidays just make whats always there more pronounced.  Its not a major revelation, I've known this for a long time, but its startling how persistent the negative thoughts are nonetheless.  Maybe the trick is acceptance.  Maybe deep down i know it will always be this way and all i can do is keep marching and make the best of it.  Even if its hard and it all seems so pointless.  I'll keep sabatoging my own happiness and hating myself for it for another year, and then another and another and so on...  All you have to do is keep smiling and telling everyone you're fine and everything is great.  And try to ignore how broken you are.  For another year.  And another and so on...",Depression
"Path of self destruction So after fighting this for over a decade, I've officially given up. I grew up in a relatively well off, loving, caring, and protective family, but apparently that means shit all in my brain. The past year was full of sleeping all day and lying in bed, and spending time on the computer. Mostly unemployed because freelancing for this company doesn't get me enough income.

To top it off, I stupidly bought a house in a period when I was stable so I have that guilt of letting my sister pay my mortgage for me for the next 35 years to fuss over. I've decided to stop taking my medication effective immediately. (because again can't pay without parents's gracious kindness which they do give but boy do I hate relying on other people) Though i may be taking smaller and smaller doses just so I'm not wasting 900 of my local currency worth of meds that don't work. The side effects are F U N but I'm gonna power through it for now. I no longer trust professional help, psychiatrists or therapists alike. 

I'm cutting myself out from what little internet friends and irl friends I have left because wow have I been conning everyone my whole life when I'm this piece of shit individual who don't treasure the good she has. Damn. Family are still stubbornly trying to keep me anchored but it doesn't work anymore honestly. And today I have the epiphany that I've been so isolated my whole life that it'd be so easy to disappear. Since I can't bring myself to self harm or suicide (yet and not for lack of fantasizing about it either), going incognito seems to be the only pathway left to me. All I'll need to do is move, change my phone number, and poof. Gone. Just like that.

Scary how easy that is, huh?

I don't trust myself to be formally employed because I've fucked up at over 8 establishments so far. Falling into stress when there's no reason to be stressed at all and quitting immediately because I'm incapable of being responsible or sane. Every time I think I'm fine and making it and normal, POOF! Gone. Just like that.

I'm tired. I'm tired of trying and failing. I'm tired of the same thing happening despite what I thought was my best foot forward. So why continue? I've done all the things right. So it's about time I listen to what the world is telling me and that I should work on becoming the worst I could be. Because I clearly don't belong in this life.",Depression
"(QUESTION) I don't suffer from depression, and the dictionary definition doesn't let me understand what it really is. Can anyone suffering from depression describe it in the most easy to understand terms possible? I think many people would benefit from this thread. I don't suffer from depression, as mentioned in the title. I have a few friends who are sufferers, usually on anti-depressants. If I ask to talk about it, I usually just hear ""It's fine"", or ""I don't want to talk about it"". The official dictionary defenition of depression goes down as:

*  ""feelings of severe despondency and dejection""

Obviously, to someone like me who has never suffered, this does not allow me to understand it at all. Could anyone who is suffering or has suffered explain, describe and try give me an understanding of what it is and how it, essentially, works? I'm not really into psychology or anything of that sort, but would like to hear and start a meaningful thread with many sufferers, to try and understand how they felt and what it was / is like.

From looking around online, I can't find much that makes sense to me.

I respect everyone's views so please feel free to say anything and everything, as this ""question"" has been stuck in my mind for the past few days. 

Hope to hear from as many of you as possible! Will be replying to as many as possible, I have many questions.

Depressed after drinking? So I did struggle with depression before but lately it was a lot better. But after drinking I feel it creeping back. As if drinking triggers it the next day? Any of you experienced something similar?,Depression
"Please help me figure out if I'm depressed or not Hey guys. So I've recently noticed my desire to get out and socialize has been declining over the past year or so. I've had trouble figuring out if I'm depressed or if the reasons I don't want to socialize are legitimate reasons or if they're just excuses and I'm actually depressed. Let me explain...

First some background. I'm 27, engaged to a beautiful fianc?? and live in a home that we own. Work and bills are not an issue.  I get up at 5:45 am to get to my job. I'm never late, make a good salary, etc. I wake up a decent hour even on my off days. I am productive around my house. Working on projects, grocery shopping, cleaning, organizing, etc. I do smoke weed and i know that can contribute but it helps me sleep. Just a few hits a night. Nothing crazy. And for the depression part...I also have a great group of friends high school/college friends. When they're doing fun things...I never want to go. Here are my excuses/reasons. 

IM NOT A DRINKER AND EVERYONE ELSE IS. First off, I'm cheap. Then on top of that, I hate hangovers, I hate spending $50 every night on alcohol I don't like the taste of or the effects of. (Plus I'm trying to save for our Bali honeymoon without cleaning out my bank account) A couple drinks is it for me, otherwise I get a huge headache, stomach ache and a hangover. Hate it. And they all drink constantly. All of them. I'd rather stay home and play video games, watch movies, etc. Some people will say find new friends but I'm not ditching them because they drink. They're still my friends. 

I also hate small talk with borderline friends. I'm not talking about my good friends that I mentioned before. I'm talking about friends of friends. Not interested in shooting the shit at all. 

TLDR; I hate small talk, I'm cheap, and I'm not a binge drinker and everyone i hang out with drinks heavily. Im not going to find new friends. Not necessary. Plz help. I don't know if I'm depressed and making excuses or if I'm just a homebody and that's okay. ",Depression
"New years eve Okay so I've been doing a bit better lately, but holy shit this year started with an intense episode! Just a bit before midnight I fell into an emotional hole that I knew very well but hadn't visited for a while. It's a bit better now, but the fireworks and how they suddenly scared the shit out of me and how I went into numbness and isolation was intense. I hope your transition was better, and on a better note: I had a really bad time last year and everything was getting better, and still is, even if this relapse happened. Happy 2019, please continue your journey, too! I was close to my own end a few times, but I don't want to die at the worst time of my life, that's what always got me through (well since I decided that with 17 or sth). Now I'm still here, and life can be hell, and life can be nothing, and life can be worse than worthless, but lately, except last night, good things started happening again. It's easy for me, I'm an optimistic realist, I can at least always aknowledge the good things possible, but even if you can't see them, and even if they are not happening right now, stay in there, get through it, know you are more loved than you think (almost everyone is, only those that think everyone loves them are in the wrong), and keep fighting if you can. I'm proud of you for being alive! And secretly, I'm a little proud of me for still being alive, too. I fight my demons, and they can be strong, but they never won the war, only some battles.

"Hello. Hello. I made a new account just for this. I always lurked on reddit before but I think it's time to put my mind to some kind of virtual paper.



I haven't felt alive for nearly a decade. I've felt lost around tens of familiar faces. I've felt lost around familiar surroundings and I've felt lost around a place that I should think is home. I'm afraid that I'm slipping away, afraid that I'll lose myself to everything. My grip on reality's loosening with each day and I can feel it despite not doing anything about it. I've made the attempt to end my life before and I'm still here. I've made the attempt to better myself and failed. I've made the attempt to live and I merely existed. Each time again and again. Somehow I'm not sad, not fully at least. Maybe I've lost the sense of the word, to no longer feel sad and instead just to feel like a host to a hollow body. Maybe it's overly poetic or stupid but I just don't know anymore. Flowing through this river of time has let me look at so many others and their joyful expressions, their relationships, their experiences and I can't feel jealousy towards any of it. I can just watch from the sidelines and remain still, emotionally and physically.

"Anybody else feel like nobody really cares about you? Quick explanation: I have a few friends that I talk to every now and then but the only people I regularly interact with are my roommates (they dont really have a choice) All the rest of my ""friends"" really make me think that they only talk to me so they wont be blamed if I take the bridge one day. Reason being all my conversations with them last about 5 minutes max, they happen like once a week at best, and the only time I ever hang out with them is when I supply food or recreational substances of some kind, otherwise its ""I'm too busy, maybe next week, some other time."" Then I'll see on their snap/insta ""so bored hmu"" or something to that effect. All of this combined always makes me feel like an outsider or like I'm only around because I offer them things whenever we hang out.

"The new year doesn't mean shit if you don't put in the effort to change anything This is mostly an angry letter to myself. 

Unfortunately, I got the worst traits from my parents. Apathy from my mom, and a control freak from my dad, nice. Being self aware and lazy is one of the worst combos, I can feel myself getting worse but I barely put any effort in to change. Am I really just using depression as an excuse to be lazy? Do I subconsciously like being mentally ill or the idea of it? What a sick fuck. I don't even know what I'm saying here. 

I just know that this New year, new meù stuff is bullshit. Time isn't even real so how will a new year be any different? Who even thought that a new year is the perfect time to change? You could've changed 6 months ago, yet you didn't. So what makes this year any different? You don't do shit in your life, what's going to magically happen to get up off your lazy ass and change? 

I was on Instagram watching everyone's rewindù of the year. Everyone had something memorable that impacted them, good or bad, yet I had nothing. Nothing good or bad, but for some reason I'm even worse than I was last year. I don't do shit, my life is a fucking joke, so what's the point of wasting a whole other year of just getting worse? 

But at the same damn time I want to change. I want to start drawing and getting back into art again. I want to go to Mexico and see my family that I've never been able to see because my dad is stupid lol. I want to continue my Spanish studies so I'm actually able to talk to them.

"uh yeah hello there (sorry in advance for no capitalisation, HAVE THESE CAPITAL LETTERS TO SOOTHE YOUR SOULS)

just wanted to post here, since i'm pretty new on reddit and such- but to be honest, i just want to vent and i don't know anybody who'd be up for listening. i'll start by saying, yes, i'm 14. i know that i'm young, and i know that part of my depression is probably just hormones, but it still fucking sucks. speaking of sucking, holidays this year were really shit. i thought that christmas would at least make me feel a little bit better, but of course, no. somehow i wasn't even excited about spending the money i received, which normally i would be, but i just.. don't care? but anyway, break is almost over and i'll be back to struggling to go to school with my head of year pressuring me to go. i don't know what i'm supposed to do anymore, it's been another year and i still don't. i really want to kill myself, and have tried once, but couldn't do it. i don't want to just leave my online friends hanging- i still want to spend time with them because they're the only thing that can make me happy next to drawing- but even drawing is fucking depressing now. oh, and on top of all of that; eating disorder. i lost like a stone and a half last year through starving myself and purging, but i gained all of it back when my depression got even worse, and now i can't care anymore.

 i still hate myself too much to let anyone other than my family see me, which adds to the ""not being able to go to school"" thing. it really stings that i'm so god damn bloated and fat that my old, smaller skirt doesn't fit without a struggle anymore. i have friends at school, i have good grades, but none of that really matters, i still can't bring myself to be there. 2 of my friends also have a  mental illness- one is an old ""friend"" with anxiety, the other girl isn't diagnosed, but she clearly also has some kind of social anxiety and depression because of her parents (they wont take her seriously)- and uh, excuse me i'm going to go a little off topic here, gotta get this off my chest. the girl with anxiety i have never liked, but i cant not be friends with her because she guilt trips you (unintentionally probably) with her anxiety or self harm. she's the edgiest person i've ever met besides yours truly when it came to mental illness. there have been several times where she has tried to unscrew sharpeners in the middle of class, thrown it at me and said ""don't let me have it!!!"". i swear. when she saw my own self harm scars (from an aforementioned ""suicide attempt""- blade wasn't thicc enough)  she started crying in the middle of class and was sobbing into my arm about ""dOnT dO tHaT aGaIn lEaRn fRoM mY mIsTakEs""- very awkward and uh, not good? last thing, she has also made fun of eating disorders several times, in front of me, like it was nothing. i feel like she just doesn't understand them?

"The relationship between depression and a cynical mindset Something I've noticed over the years of suffering from depression is that it changes you in many ways. One way that stands out to me is the kinda cynical, almost reckless mindset it can put you in. For me it's not really giving a fuck about things I should or thinking about them negatively, or when I sit and become lonely all I want is someone to suffer with me rather than make it betterù or whatever. 
Like a lot of people I became involved in self harm, and I always had this fantasy about having a friend I could harm myself with and talk about it freely with no judgment. But I mean that literally promotes self destructive behaviour, and doesn't promote recovery.

"My story??? Idk My dad has a night job away for a few days so I'm always alone, and whenever he's back he gets angry at me for crying or being useless. Whenever I see my nan it's like waking On eggshells, since she's always annoyed about something about me. I feel useless and terrible, especially being compared to my drug addict bipolar mother. Unlike her, I've never abused or hit anyone. I got really sad because no one cared about my mental health, and mistook it for laziness. They refused to take me seriously and take me to a doctor for some time, until my nan caved and took me to a counselor (only after my school counsellor called). After she went to our gp, she complained the counslelor was stupid, and that my depression was just a bit of anxietyù. Instead of allowing for medication, she gave me nice smelling serum. It doesn't do anything. 

I used to have a crush on this boy way back, but at the time he was really popular, and even though he felt the same, all the other popular girls thought I was unsuitableù and uglyù. They bullied me and talked about me while I could hear them, while the boy was completely clueless the whole time. They eventually made up rumours bad enough for him to dislike me. The worse part was that when I was alone at home (dads a truck driver) I started seeing things around the house. With the possums on the roof, I got really freaked out almost every night. Thankfully they're gone now.
Eventually I lost all my friends except my best one, who could sympathise with my dads anger issues (I told her all about them). Unfortunately, by the end of the year she had found someone she liked more. After that I spent 5 months alone until I convinced my family to let me move schools. 
Before I moved I went to the excursion to a different state. I had hoped to maybe reconcile any bullying from other people, but unfortunately I just felt more alone. I thought about killing myself on the beach when no one was watching, but then didn't have the courage. 
When I moved schools I convinced myself I was going to make some friends. I met this nice girl and felt sorry that she didn't seem to hang out with anyone, so I became friends with her. One day I sent a snap that she disapproved of being on her Snapchat group, saying it was not allowed. I didn't get why, so then she twisted the story and made a rant about how annoying I was to her other ?friends' on her story. I eventually found out she did this thing commonly to try and win them over, and felt kind of sorry for her. I made two new friends after and she tried to refriend me, but I didn't accept it.
My dog died shortly after because he got hit by a car and no one reported it until it was too late. He was five years old.!
The two friends I made seemed like a good idea, but soon they felt kind of awkward. I didn't know what to do because I didn't know how to interact or trust people, and my social skills felt drained. S was nice, but L kept putting me down and talking behind my back with S. eventually I felt offended enough and left to nap in the sick bay regularly while I finished my year. No amount of counselling at school ever stopped the panic attacks I had every exam I did throughout the year. I was questioning my life and how I wanted to spend it, while feeling really lonely. 
My dads anger issues and general asshole ness has lessened a bit, if any. I think my nan revealed I wanted to leave and never speak to him again, because now he doesn't yell as much. I don't forgive him though, especially since he won't recognise he's done anything wrong. 
I made a friend with whom was in my class, and began to secretly obtain antidepressants and a counselor. Unfortunately a counsellor won't be available until 2019(sometime this year). My new friend A is really nice. She's much wilder and less innocent than I thought, and even does drugs. I wanted to experience happy times in my life, so she let me have a bit of ket on our first night out. I understand she needs to spend time with her boyfriend, and she once drunkenly told me I was a bit annoying but she likes me coz I'm nice. I understand I'm probably annoying because everyone avoids me, but at least she's honest and wants to stay my friend.
I graduated with a shitty score, too drugged up on antidepressants to care. I'm taking a gap year to find myself, and hopefully get a good enough job to pay for my own apartment or to flatemate. Every so weeks me and A get cooked off our faces, going clubbing or hanging out at birthday parties. Her boyfriend is nice, we oddly enough have similar music taste. I got a puppy, and although I struggle to appreciate her I really love her, and would do anything to make sure she's ok. I feel like going off the rails, because I want to feel like a teenager for once, or at least happy with my friends. When you're alone at home and at school, that kind of life feels to unfair and depressing since my dad is so angry. I'm hoping my isolation from school won't make me too lonely, and every day I track how many times I talk to people before I think it's too muchù and that I'll be too annoying. I'm afraid of dying, especially being an atheist and the general concept of never being alive again. I understand it's part of life, but it still haunts me that my past feels wasted (and that my future might be too). I don't feel like I can ask this to anyone, maybe my future counsellor might have some answers. I've stopped my antidepressants coz they weren't doing anything, and dramatically enough I feel like my monthly use of ketamine is actually making me happier (I'm never doing opiates or benzodiazepines I promise, done my research). I feel like I'm escaping my life, but at least it's keeping me occupied for now. I wonder what this new year holds.",Depression

"Quick Relief Tips Thought it might be cool to have people write any suggestions for people seeking help in dealing with intense depression. Anything is welcome! What are things you have tried/use in times when you feel truly at your worst?



For myself, I will start with a basic, BREATHE. I know it's what everyone and there mom tells you but if you really learn to do it well it can be the difference to making change...

1. Focus all your energy on each part of the breath, Inhale, to Exhale. 

2. Allow any thoughts (good/bad) to be noticed but pass, acknowledge them and come back to the breath. Don't try to block anything out, let them come and pass. Hard to do but keep practicing and it gets easier!  

3. Be present, the longer you can focus on what you are doing in the moment the better. In this moment be open and don't give up. ",Depression

"Just trying to find someone to talk to Something is seriously wrong with me. So I was in a healthy and happy relationship for 3 years with a girl who lives on a different continent but we managed to see each other a lot and even traveled to 5 different countries together. She always wanted to marry me and I proposed to her last August. She said yes and we made plans on either me moving to her country or vice versa. I did EVERYTHING for this girl, everything. 3 months later she told me she doesn?t wanna marry so soon and wants a break from the relationship because she needs to be mentally stable first. She changed completely and I found out she caught feelings for someone else. Now I?m just laying in my bed completely heartbroken over my loss and I don?t know what to do.

What concerns me is the way I handle these kind of things. I shattered a mirror, started hurting myself, bruised my knuckles and stopped eating. I think about killing myself every single day and may even have set something up to actually end it. 

I know it?s pathetic to react like this to a break up. I?ve had issues dealing with loss ever since my brother died 10 years ago. I feel like it fucked me up so much that now I cling too hard to people and get insanely depressed once I lose them. 

I know I should go to a therapist and get treated. I already take meds but they?re probably way too low. I really have problems talking to strangers about my feelings though. I hate when people see me cry or being fragile or whatever, I can?t stand it it makes me incredibly uncomfortable. So what do I do? Is there someone who reacts similar to loss? I feel like an idiot, I feel so weak because I let one single person fuck up my life like that. But yo she was EVERYTHING to me and I gave her the world. This whole situation was completely unexpected and idk man I?m just so done.",Depression

At work it's just a bunch of Koreans I can't understand and obscenely fake people who's words are worth less then dirt. I have no friends, everyone just leaves so I gave up on trying and now I can't even do it any more. 

I used to be charismatic, now I'm a stumbling wreck with no friends, desperately wanting someone to talk to, while simultaneously knowing I will only push them away so I don't let anyone near. My life has literally zero meaning. My mom once told me it was ok if I killed myself. She's far more suicidal then I am. The only reason she's staying is because me and I feel bad because she's exactly the same as me but constantly in physical pain as well. I don't know what to do. Every day feels pointless and empty.

 I'm not going to kill myself, I'm just lonely, but too scared of the consequences of finding anyone to do anything. Even my ex told me I was wrong, then he told me he was thinking about things and wanted to go on a break and still be friends, and then stopped talking out of nowhere.

I have been taking resolutions though every year hoping that some day I look back and find that I've made a difference, not something fancy as making a difference in the world but making a difference in myself. Yet here I am 50kgs, depressed, lonley and hopelessly lost. The same I was 8 years ago.

"Tough time Hey you guys.



This is my first post on r/depression. I was looking for community rules and couldn't find them, so hopefully I won't be breaking any of them...



I'm 27, Female, Developer.



I'm kinda struggling lately and feeling lonely and thought venting anonymously, here, might help...



A little about me... about a year ago the love of my life broke up with me. In retrospective - it was the best thing that could have happened to me, but it was still a serious heartbreak to recover from... We had an unhealthy symbiotic relationship where we did lots of drugs of any kind you could possibly think of.

I isolated myself from all the other people in the world that weren't him - I lost contact with my family and friends and was slowly (but steadily) spiralling down deeper and deeper.



A year has gone by, in which I've changed and changed my lifestyle 180 degrees.

I'm back to having decent relationship with my family, I have a handful of friends (some are closer than others), I've started taking antidepressants and I managed to find the power to quit the job I hated and find myself a new, challenging place.

(I'm also seeing a psychologist for about 3 years, doing psychoanalysis therapy, which helps a bunch.)



It's been 3 months since I've started the new job, and lately I'm really struggling...

It takes time to get to know new friends in a new workplace. The work itself is very challenging (and interesting) and hard. I'm a friendly person, but human connections are just something that builds slowly by nature.

At times I feel so lonely and alone, especially on the weekends and on depressed days. It's really hard for me to find the power to do activities during the weekend, and usually I just sleep it off and wait for it to be over.

No one in this new work knows I'm struggling with depression, or that I'm on antidepressants. This makes me feel more isolated. But I don't want to share this info with others before they get to know me better, as I don't want it to affect the way they see me, mostly professionally.

On top of that, I'm also struggling with eating disorders and a CRAZY, sometimes unbearable longing to my dear drugs...

Dealing with depression is super hard work that sometimes drains all my energy. Taking drugs makes all the bad feelings disappear \*right away\*, but then when their effect is over, everything is 10 times worse...



I'm conflicted and exhausted and frustrated and lonely...

Sigh.

Thanks for listening.",Depression
"I've started finding if difficult to believe my friends want to spend time with me. I've been growing apart from many friends lately. Many times when there are events, I find myself thinking that nobody would really care if I show up or not, so I rarely join in. 

I've also found this even becomes the case after people invite me to trips places - e.g. I get invited, but I then never follow up because whenever I think about following up, I don't think they really want me there.



Logically, I think they probably want me around, but I can't seem to convince myself that it is true. It probably sounds crazy.

"Effexor nightmare - please share with me if you relate to this, I am terrified af Hi, I havent posted anything in here, but this new medication has freaked me out hard. So before being out on Effexor, I used to take Lexapro and it helped with my anxiety and OCD.  However the doctor didnt think the lexapro was helping my depression enough and decided to put me on effexor. This is where my nighmare began. Upon starting on Effexor XR of 37.5 mg, I immediately got insomnia, something I have never struggled with. I decided i need to give Effexor a chance to work. So i stuck to 75mg/day for about 8 weeks. During those weeks, I struggled with sleep and felt terrible energy unable to leave my body. One day i was sick and tired of it all and cold turkeyed off of Effexor. 

I thought the insomnia was over. Wrong! It is worse now. Additionally, i feel a terrible restlessness, almost like I want to jump out of my skin. I preoccupy myself with noticing my heartbeat a lot more than before. I do not understand what weont wrong with Effexor, but if i cant fix my sleep somehow...why live

One more thing - on Effexor, sometimes i wake up gasping for air . Lately that has been happening even during conscious hours. What is the deal with this damn Effexor? The restlessness, akathasia and insomnia are driving me to total despair. I feel random busts of flight or flight and it makes my body jerk up lately as well

Still, I'm not in total doom and gloom at the moment, just fairly gloomy. Life is just tiresome. I'm in no danger of suicide or anything, but I just don't really find my life to be worthwhile, and I'm very, very slow at trying to change things to make that different. I usually try to ignore how unfulfilled I am, but the holidays make that hard with all the world shouting about togetherness, family, friends, hope for the new year, etc. I don't have the first three things, and lack the will to do much about the fourth. At the rate I try to improve my life the day I can say I really want to live will be very far off (and possibly of course never arriving). But I don't have the courage/strength to go faster, so it is what it is. Luckily at least I'm pretty darn used to all this by now and know the glooms will lift in time because my brain just can't keep it up forever.

(Me) For the past about 4-5 years I've just gotten more sad and quiet by the day, and always wanting to be alone at night. I don't want to say I have depression because I have not been diagnosed with it. But I honestly don't know what I'd say I do have.. I am 18 and attend college now, and really just keep to myself and don't talk to many people, I mostly only talk to my grandma and mom (family-wise) because I don't get along with my dad or sister. Its 2019, and after telling myself I would try my hardest to stay happy I just got even more upset and angry a few minutes into the new year. I really don't have any friends. In the past I've gone through a ton of friend groups and was always the one out or just didn't belong. In 2018, I fell in love with a girl but after finding out she had a boyfriend, I had to move on. I have a small friend group but they all went out without me for NYE and I guess its time to say goodbye to them. Anyways, I wake up everyday side, never wanna talk even though i have so much to say, Wanna always be in the dark, and I'm always in a sad mood but can never show it.

"please help, what just happened? I was in a chat room with friends of mine when one of them staged an 'intervention' and told me that i was being overtly depressive and that i should 'go and think about what i've just been posting,' and this triggered me into going into some depressive thoughts. After a while, i started getting chills, like when your sick, and started almost hyperventilating, freaking out even more over my depressive thoughts, and then i would briefly calm down, and the chills would go away, but then the chills would come back and i would freak out again. At the end i was crying and had locked my normally open door so no one in my family could possibly come into my room and see what was happening with me. It was intensely freaky when i finally calmed down by composing a note about my hidden depression to one of my best friends and i looked back and thought back about how i was telling myself i should die a painful death for being the terrible person I am and that i locked myself in my room to prevent anyone from seeing me.",Depression

"Update I know these updates help me vent a lot, but im sorry in sdvance for posting a lot to here. Its new years, i came into the new year depressed as hell and goinf through a panic attack. My anxiety is theough the roof about my girlfriend because i overthink shit but also just in general. Im pretty much allowing her to chest on me with her girlfriends because im not there, its long distance for the month. But I told her im uncomfortable with it and all and tried telling her how i feel about it. It makes it worst. Less communication and just less effort comes from her. So i think it might be done tomorrow. I cant put myself through this and be with someone who doesnt care about how much shes hurting me. Its not just that event today but weeks worth of empty promises and distancing. 

The shitty thing is i know for a fact she will be wanting to see me none stop and be all pver me once we go back to college for the next semester, but i cant be with someone who forgets they are even with someone once they dont see them for a couple weeks. 

I guess its the relationship stuff thats been triggering my depression hard lately.  Theres more than what i just said but i just dont want to go into it more than i already did yet.

Other than that, no progress, feeling worst, sadder, having constant nightmares at night now. Hard to go to sleep. But wake up early from the bad dreams. I have a doctors appoijtment next week for medication but i need another therapy appointment probably.

"i was hopeful for 2019 2018 sucked. i mean i know it wasn't the best for many people but this year sucked. what i thought was a close sibling drifted away from me. my father went to prison for assaulting my mother. being caught in the middle of my parents fights. stress of school.  another year of being completely and utterly single. yet i still tried to be happy. tried to have some form of hope. new years has always been my favorite holiday, people drinking, being hopeful for the future. i tried and i tried really hard. new years eve was going fine, a normal dull day yet i was so excited to make some improvements. yet, right when the clock hit midnight, i got a notification. my, well what i thought was a close friend, basically said i wasn't happy enough around her, so we aren't friends anymore. now im just left here thinking about everything i could have done better, be better. i fail at so many things but i always thought of myself as a good friend but i guess i failed at that too haha. i wanted 2019 to be so many things. i wanted to  be hopeful but that text from her was just a reminder that a new number can't change anything. i know i need to try to take action and change but it's not that simple. hell it took me three years to clean my room. three years to get that motivation and clean. clean by throwing away my childhood toys, tossing away memories. the stress of school, the stress of being social i dont think i can handle this anymore. last year i remember thinking 'this is going to be the year i end my life' yet, here i am. but im thinking the same thing. its a constant cycle and i honestly don't think i have enough to live for. im an awful friend, im a awful fucking sibling, im a bad daughter. i dont do shit. i wont finish school. i wont do anything with my life even if i have the most positive fucking attitude. i dont think i can do it. from 2015 on my new years have been spent the same, thinking, 'this is the year i end my life' i usually write it off as being sad that im a year older, or that time flew. but this year, i think im at the end of my rope. its like i was dangling over a cliff and each year i got more and more rope to try to pull myself up but i failed each time and now i have no more rope. i was so excited. i had hope. but i guess i couldnt have that hope for too long right? i dont deserve to have that kind of hope. when i tell anyone how i feel i just get the 'try to be positive' or the 'im sure things will work out by itself' or 'take action' ive done all of those and yet im still stuck. i think i might spend some of 2019 doing the things i want to do before i take my leave. wrap up any loose ends, try to fix some relationships. but i ultimately hope i dont make it until 2020.

"Flash forward: here's to 2019 Another new year. I look at myself and I'm so disappointed. I suppose the place where I'm at isn't terrible, but compared to the people who I grew up with in my past, they seem so much more accomplished and happier. I've by far fell behind and went down a spiraling path. I've gained 60 pounds in two years, I was diagnosed with a critical mental illness, and I'm no where close to realizing what I want to spend my life doing (mostly career wise but also in general). I look at the close friends I had in high school, and I stopped being friends with them afterwards thinking they were the bad people that were influencing me in a negative way, to only realize they ended up succeeding and living the life that I dreamed of. Maybe I was the terrible person that got what I deserved. I've come to accept that life's not fair, but it makes me so disappointed in myself to feel like I haven't accomplished anything in life and even get worse in my progress of feeling confident and happy. I'm confused about the relationship I'm in with my boyfriend, and I feel like I lack a close group of friends I once had. I feel like an outsider that doesn't fit in with any of my peers. I even have this intent to feel like whenever I meet new people and I start getting comfortable around them to be myself, they don't accept me or dismiss my personality. I feel so alone regardless of the fact that I have family that care about me, which in turn I know it sounds selfish and greedy, but I guess that is one thing I am grateful for. It's just whenever I go to school or around my peers, I see how everyone belongs somewhere with their life and I feel like I'm lost at sea. I've felt this way for 8 years. I thought I was starting to step into a brighter path, but I see the people around me and I feel like I've gotten nowhere. I've been told not to care about what other people think or compare myself to others, but it's difficult when it's dangling in your face. I want to be more positive to take in the good things that can make me happier, but my perspective is getting so dark, it's hard to see things that way.",Depression

"Overwhelming feeling that I wasted my life. I'm 49 and wake up every morning with an overwhelming, massive, horrible, feeling that i've wasted my life.  I got a DUI about a year and a half ago (this one is a low class felony based on many that I racked up over a lifetime and Colorado looks back a lifetime).   This brought on super extreme stress and depression and suicidal thoughts.  it also triggered some OCD type memories and i started obsessing over something that happened way effing far back in college centering around this manipulative immature cunt that effed with my naive emotions (i was a virgin though out college and didn't know anything about girls and relationships).  basically, the feeling of emotional rape that these memories brought back have become unbearable.  (it's a long silly stupid story, but it affects me deeply) 

On top of that, i am on probation and piss testing which prevents me from getting blitzed drunk every 2 or 3 days like i've done for the last 20 years or so (i'm starting to realize i did this to blot out things from my past including that cunt from college as well as loneliness, depression, and emptiness).  I've stayed mostly sober for 1.5 years but can drink once a week (on a saturday, because the pee testing place is closed on sundays and i found out the 80 hour etg alcohol pee test is a total myth and all you really need is about 40 hours.).

But, now that i have a felony on my record, my career is likely ruined (i've been a mechanical engineer consultant/contractor for the last 20 years or so .  i haven't really looked for employment all that hard because i don't really need to (i have a net worth of about 1 million dollars with 2 houses that are paid off and generating rental income).  I also live with my mom at the moment mainly because she needs help at her house and this house is huge (6 bedroom and 4 bathroom).  my dad passed away 3 years ago, so it's not like i'm a burden and she says i'm welcome here as long as i want and i also bring peace to her mind in feeling more secure (a close friend got broken into recently at her house and that scared her).   i do want to get out of here because i feel like a bum staying here.  

I also deleted my facebook account a year and half ago, shortly after i got my dui because i thought for sure i was going to kill myself.  altho i miss it, it's probably better that i don't see everyone's seemingly wonderful lives unfold before me on the computer which only adds to my sense of a wasted, worthless life.  facebook envy is real.

Many of my friends have had kids, got married, etc.  while i watch and realize the best years of my life (mid 20's, early 30s) was wasted on depression, obsessive negative thinking, and alcohol abuse.  it's just not effing fair.  i don't deserve this. 

I know i can't explain every single nuance and detail about my life and what i'm feeling but i thought i'd at least try alittle.  I don't know what else to do.  i' 49.  probably too late to have a child unless i win the lottery and attract a 30 to 35 year old child bearing woman.

I have been propositioned for marriage by 2 women in my past.  one was really crazy and a bad choice.  the other, i kinda wish i did.   i've had a few chances with a couple women maybe 10 years ago where i could forsee i could've had a child with.  but, the alcohol indirectly put a damper on that. 

I wasted my life and it's a horrible horrible terrible feeling.  I don't know how to deal with these thoughts sober either.

Anyone have advice or a similar story?

"To anyone who's struggled to get their way into further education, I want to hear your stories if you're willing to share. In short: I'm doing summer school to get into university this year and I wanted to hear your experience of similar things and if it was worth it in the end. 
Long story: My mental health took a hold on me this year and I struggled more in school than I had the years before. I ended up dropping two of my classes as a suggestion from teachers as I was clearly not going to pass them. I also planned on going to med school this year, but I got steered away from that by several heads of my school who said I was not the type of student they wants, I don't have the best grades or any scholarships. I've already been rejected from one university, so I'm down to my last chance, and my only way of getting there is by doing summer school. It's a struggle I know that many people would've faced in one way or another, and I just wanted to hear about other people's experiences, the toll it took on your mentality and if it worked out for you in the end.

"Long winded post about getting outside, but was cathartic for me to go through. I subbed to r/depression a few days ago, then quickly unsubbed as I found it made things worse for me personally. But here's my (recent) story:

My only real friend in the city I live in uninvited me to her celebrations for NYE, given my ex and her new bf would be with her, as well as the girl I've been in love with and trying to court for that last year, with her new BF as well. I decided to stay home, as I have no one else here to spend the evening with. And for the first time in a while, I though about ending my life. 

I've suffered varying degrees of depression my entire life. I've tried to never self diagnose and the only time I was medically diagnosed was once when my symptoms were thought to be MS (really strange bouts of paralyzation, loss of feeling in extremities, loss of consciousness etc.), but it turned out to be depression/stress. Depression is a bitch. So I understand depression/stress is real, and can affect you on a physical level.

I posted something earlier on IG which made me think about this sub so here it is (also how do I embed a photo, it would help) but here it is:



Those who dance are considered mad,

I'm ending this year the same way I started it, and how I spent most of it; cold and alone. But I've learned to thrive this way. If you don't fit into society's view of what's normal and acceptable, are alone and depressed this NYE, or just feel like shit generally (all of the above for me), don't let the bastards grind you down. I know it's hard, they're everywhere, but you can find your own way in this world regardless. I'm still searching, but I'm stepping it up in every way in 2019. You can too.

2019 goals:

\- Solo winter climb of Casaval Ridge on Mt. Shasta

\- Solo the north face of Denali

\- Cotopaxi with my brother and sister in law and reconnect with the awesome person I met in Quito :)

\- Pay off all my debt

\- Learn welding and metal fab

\- Buy a second daily rider and start the frame up custom build on the monster.

\- Position myself to get out of the industry ASAP

2019 will likely be just as hard as this year, or every fucking year for that matter, but I won't stop trying.

"2018 Recap Hi guys, 

My 2018 was ok. I've experienced some great memories but also had many horrible ones. I've felt with depression since I was in middle school and now I'm 22. This year hit me pretty hard. I don't know if it's the stress of school, finances, relationship problems, and having a kid, but I've had quite a lot of suicidal thoughts.

For a while, I was stuck thinking that I was worthless. I felt like I was a burden to my family and once I met my boyfriend and had a kid, my feelings transferred onto him. Now I feel like I don't do enough as a mother and girlfriend. It kills me and eats me up. Also being Asian, mental health is not talked about. This year has been pretty rough for me. My feelings of worthlessness were so intense. I wanted to kill myself so many times but then I think to myself how much of a burden that would be because my boyfriend can't raise my son alone and that my son will grow up without a mom. 

December was the worst month of the year. At the end of my nursing semester, I realized I failed a course AND the day after that, my grandpa passed away. I wasn't able to grieve because since it's December and the holidays are all about happiness, I had to look like I enjoyed life. 

 I guess it is an achievement to still be here and entering 2019. I don't know if y'all are religious, but I pray to God everything to just give me a sign. School, mental health, relationship, and motherhood are hard to balance. I just pray to see a sign that there could be an improvement in my life. ",Depression

"So this year is going to be horrible. (I'm 14 and in 8th grade btw.) So the day after my birthday, two of my best friends got in a fight. (I made a post about it a while back on r/teenagers.) I thought they made up since they started somewhat talking again, but the next thing I know, they're cussing each other out and calling each other names (over text). Because of this fight and everything, one of them switched schools after Christmas. The other friend barely even talks to me ever since she started talking and hanging out with the more popular kids. (Not that I'm popular anyway...) So I can already tell that this year is going to be complete shit, and I can more than likely can't do anything about it.

"I Don't Think I'll ever be fully happy with my girlfriend but can't imagine life without her New years tonight got me feeling really depressed. I have a long time girlfriend who loves me very much, and i love her but ive also recently began feeling so conflicted and like things will never be the way it should be between us again.

We dated for two and a half years in high school and freshman year of college. I broke up with her because we were trying the long distance thing and it just wasnt working. We spent a couple years apart and then reconnected and remembered how much we truly love each other again. The 3 years since then have had their ups and downs but have mostly been good. Recently however ive found out more and more about our time apart and how she was probably a bit of a party girl who may have slept with her fair share of guys. When we were apart i hooked up with a couple girls but it was never easy.

The last week or so my mind has been consumed by nothing but mental images of her with other guys. I know i'm the one who broke her heart and she mentions that to me when i tell her i feel this way. but it doesnt change the fact that i feel like i have constant mental anguish. She tells me she loves me and has always has and may have hooked up with other guys to cope with the pain of losing me, and i get it but i just cant get it out of my head.

We're approaching the point of no return i feel like where marriage may be coming up over the horizon but i don't know if i can commit to her. i dont know if i'll feel this way forever and be consumed by these feelings of jealousy and honestly pure torture. i've dealt with depression my whole life but this is one of the worst feelings ive ever had. i really do love her so much and i know breaking up with her would crush and break her heart again but if a life with her means constant mental torture i dont know how long i can live like that.

part of me wants to start fresh find a dorkier girl who's more like me and more socially quirky like me i suppose. but im also afraid ill never find that person and regret this forever. im fairly good looking but often painfully awkward and feel like my current girlfriend is beautiful, sweet, and caring. but it just feels like its impossible to go back to our first relationship when we were each others first and only partners. i know its not fair to blame her for living her life when we were apart but i just cant help myself.

i dont know what to do it feels like whatever i do will lead myself to a life of anguish and depression. i just want to be happy with her again but i dont know if its possible and im just starting to feel like my future is going to be filled with misery. i dont know if this really falls under depression but this conundrum has certainly worsened my depression and has made me feel as bad as i ever have. im not contemplating suicide or anything like that now but im afraid if i make the wrong decision i could be headed down a dark lonely road that could lead to a bad ending.",Depression

2018 was pretty hard on me in many ways, and it was a year I just couldn't wait until it was over. There were it's peaks here and there, but mostly it was me struggling to wake up everyday, living a shitty routine with a very shitty ""job"" sucking my soul for the third year in a row. A lot of the following is just me letting it all go out, because I really need to. If you don't want to read it all, you can just skip to about the last two paragraphs.

It started out badly since I was taking my time in vacations, letting 2017 cool off so I could get back to life at some point in February, when at January the 9th I had this call making me come back to my job and start it already earlier. Mind you, I barely had 2 weeks of rest. It wasn't like the other previous 2 years when I was excited to get back to work as soon as possible (but the same ""less than 2 weeks of rest"" happened). It was just me dragging myself unwillingly to that horrendous city that I loathe and can't wait the time I'll finally move from. After some few days though, it just felt normal and I was back on my axes - still, though, there was still not much rest between 2017 and 2018. This whole almost-non-stop routine had me working since the beginning of 2016 (that is, I almost had no vacations since the start of 2016). Off I was though, spending my vacations away working (for reasons).

Somewhere around half of March a real turning point in my life took place. I had this very bad headache that just didn't make a lot of sense at all at the time. I felt a pressure in my brain and sleeping more, eating healthier or avoiding coffee didn't seem to work. Long story short, I freaked out because I thought (paranoiac) that I might could have something like cancer. Suddenly everything seemed pointless at that point, even though I didn't visit a doctor to have any sort of check on that. There's something truly desperate on thinking that you'll might die, and most of it is due to the fact that you become extremely impotent in front of the situation. It's strange how one day you feel bulletproof and another day you realize you're but the product of the odds. It doesn't really matter if you eat x or y, or forgive w or z - maybe 12 months from now you'll be but a memory in some peoples heads. It's way different from thinking that the same thing will happen but in, say, a 100 years.



After something that must have been around 12 days in this desperation state, the headache just went away. It didn't take me long to realize that that was the byproduct of extreme stress. I was starting to work out intensively (being sedentary before), not having proper vacations when I should, and trying to get into r/nofap (tl;dr; there are a lot of lies spread there, honestly). The headaches eventually came back every now and then, but always weaker and weaker. After some months I never felt anything again. Somewhere around May I had this episode, much like in the beginning of the year, that I just didn't want to work or do anything at all but playing videogames at all - but still had to get back to life. I was visiting my parents in my hometown, and then headed back to where I currently live in what may have been one of the worst travels I made in my life; because I know I definitely didn't want to go where I was going, and definitely didn't want to do what I was going there to do. The day after I arrived, I woke up at 8am(ish), but just managed to get enough motivation to get out of bed around 2pm. I really just couldn't help it. Needless to say, I had a schedule filled with things and places that I had to be since 9am, but missed it all up to 3pm. That was the day I realized I needed some sort of life change - I quit my job some few days later but, because of my responsibilities, I had to stick around the team to provide help on some things when necessary. I'll stop this part here, there are reasons why it had to be this way (against my will, in fact), but this ""suspended-animation"" of work was indeed weighting on my back until the end of last November. 



All the while, in this big drama of stress and demotivation, there was the helplessness of feeling like that and having nothing to do about it. I had this ""half-job"" I was keeping some responsibilities, classes at college (at which I've always been too hard on myself), while having to live daily with extremely toxic and disrespectful people, even when they knew the kind of hell I was going through - and I just couldn't change anything more for the better. They just didn't care. There's no such a thing as an ""unhealthy mind"" for some. If they manage to do stuff, why can't I, amitire? ""You just have to want to do it, and then do it."" It freaking haunts me to think that I actually did so much of a meaningful job for that team in the past, went deep into things no one ever went and won't go for a long time still, but still some remember me only as being the ""vacationer"" from this last season - hated by not working too much, when the reason I wasn't working that much was working too hard in the first place (and the obvious fact that I wasn't part of the team anymore). Working at times literally no one was. I say this assured that there were a lot of times I was about the only one in the team working in some moments of the year.



So all in all, the sequels from this year were something that can be summarized as a big, utter, demotivation with my field in college, which was something I was so happy and loving about back in the day (and deep down I still do). No, it's not just the natural decay of the early excitement when you first get into doing something. I really lost something that I want so hard to have it back. When I think about it though, I don't know what to do. I know I'm extremely capable of being very productive and scoring high on tests, but that exactly all that I simply can't do anymore, right now. If I study hard, that lasts for a week and then I get extremely unproductive. Everything just ends up being me being almost ok at tests, despite wanting deep down to make the run for it and definitely nailing it.  I can't sit with my laptop and try to get some good work done because... I don't know, am I tired? am I over-stressed? Am I drifting into something darker mental-health-wise? What I know is that I sincerely crave to feel just like I was when I was in the first year of my major. Engineering can be a bit cumbersome sometimes.

  
So here I am, writing this at around 5am in NYE, hoping so much that this thing I crave for can come back to me like a bullet train in 2019; and hoping that you guys can shed some good light on how to get this motivation back. I do feel a bit pointless and without purpose waking up in the morning (which has become harder and harder), and I know pretty well that I want to get this feeling out of my way. I want to be able to raise every single day of this year and all the following years of my life pumped up, rev up my ass and have a blast doing what I know I truly love deep down inside. It keeps me going the thought that, after a very fucked up day/week/month/year there must be more on store. There always is, and that's the greatest part. Sometimes you just have to hold on, but I just need some help with this. Happy new year everyone.",Depression

"What is 'THIS' ? I have just had a new year celebration with my ex-girlfriend and my brother. They leave. I feel like I wasn't on form and I wasn't my best self. I haven't self-harmed in years. I immediately resorted to sitting on my carpet and scoring deep lines into my left inner thigh with a kitchen knife. I already feel self-indulgent. I sit here and always find myself coming back to this same idea that I don't want to be part of this society. I hate it. I feel guilty about being part of where we are heading. I don't want to kill myself but I don't want to live. I have tried to adapt.?continually! I don't want to die but I don't want be part of  ?THIS', whatever this is!



I will wake up tomorrow and pretend I didn't feel this way, like it was some kind of temporary insanity but this feeling will be there, underneath it all, a pervasive feeling of being unsettled and being a hypocrite. I will also read this back and feel embarrassed that I ever posted this and likely delete it, telling myself it was the intoxicated and irrational talk of a different person. I will then mentally dust myself off and carry on with my habitual thinking.

"New years Cheers for another dissapointing year, of a wasted life, with no prospects or hope, dragging itself along a path made not for him, but for people that are not wastes of skin.

A life that no matter how much one tries to save or help, it still goes towards the gutter, for I am not that lucky, nor am I smart or pretty, I'm merely another nobody, just that unlike other nobodies, I have no talent, neither I have status or money, I am simply a sink, a waste, where people put in their undesired things, to then forget about them, this is the destiny of myself, and even then, one has to wonder, why do I keep going, what keeps someone as worthless as me going?

Perhaps it's fear of death, perhaps it's some misguided hope or merely some sense of spite.

Anyway, it cannot be really figured out, and frankly, I don't think the effort should be wasted on someone like me.

So again, cheers to this miserable and useless live!",Depression
"I'm never going to be normal I've faced it. I'm never going to be happy or normal. I am 17 and can't remember the last time I was truly happy.

My mother committed suicide on Christmas night last year and passed away on January 6th after being on a breathing machine. She was addicted to opiates and had mental issues and I wasn't always the closest to her. But I loved her.

My cat just died Saturday night. I haven't stopped crying. My eyes are swollen from it. I had him for 16 years. He truly was my best friend. He was so good to me and I'd tell him all my secrets, he was with me through all my trauma, everything. My heart feels like it's been ripped out of my chest and stomped on. I'm not nearly close to getting over the death of my mother and now my cat, my true best friend, dies.

On top of this, my friends and family knew how much I loved my cat and nobody is checking in on me except for one friend. I guess people don't understand that losing him literally hurts almost exactly as much as losing my mom does. But hardly anyone checked on me during that time either. Other than that one friend I am all alone. Not even my cousin who apparently loves me and witnessed me bawl my eyes out could check on me. I don't expect everyone to be there for me 24/7, people have their own lives, but a how're you doing?ù text would at least be nice. Especially since you have the time to post dumb shit all over social media.

I've lost people prior to this year. 2 cousins, 2 aunts, my childhood best friend, my grandfather, I could keep going.

I'm so fucking sad. Grief has overtaken me every single day for years. Everyone around me dies, I think I have some sort of death cloud that follows me.

I'm just depressed in general as well. My brain dwells on my childhood trauma all fucking day and it kills me. I also have body dysmorphia. This kills me too. When I look in the mirror I see a fat, hideous monster. It makes me cry. My anxiety from it prevents me from taking to people because I know I am so fucking ugly. No matter what anyone says I'll never believe them. I feel like I'm the fat girl everyone pities and people just lie to me to try to make me feel better.

I get good grades in school but I fucking hate it. I dread going to school its so terrible for me. My anxiety ruins me. My life is terrible. It's just sadness all fucking day. I don't want to live past 25 but lately I don't even know if I can do that. I don't want to be here much longer. I cant kill myself because it'll hurt my dad and grandma, (and my other cat who keeps me going) but I just don't care about my life or value it that much. 

I haven't cut myself in a few months but the urge is strong. I'm trying so hard not to cut but I don't know how much more I can handle this.

I have an amazing therapist but I haven't been able to see her for awhile due to her health complications. She's an amazing person and she helps me but regardless my depression is still bad. Antidepressants don't work. They just make me so much more suicidal.

Yeah that's about it. I had to get this out somewhere. ",Depression

"[Spoiler] I think one of the Black Mirror endings really represents what many people are going through I'm talking about the ending where Stefan goes on the train ride with his mom and dies with her. I think it really shows what a lot of us are going though. When Stefan's mother died, a piece of himself was lost. Throughout Stefan's life, he's trying to cope with this lost piece but in reality we all know that he will never get it back. With Stefan's death, he's able to finally let go. Everything that he's been fighting against is finally gone. He can be at peace with himself. He can be with the one person he truly loved: his mother.

I don't know why we choose to keep going. Some of us do it because we don't want to let people down, others because of the future things we might achieve, and some because of the people around us, upon just a few reasons and guesses. Some of us may actually end up fine one day. But there's also some of us that probably will struggle the rest of our lives to be okay, just like Stefan.

People think I am happy because I blend with people and when I do that I feel like i lose even more of myself and I can never get that part of me back. I have tried to think about the ways I can die but then I think about my family and all the things that would happen and all I can think about it my family and I could never do anything to them like that. I can't kill myself and I can't talk about it because my family thinks I am joking or lying because they don't believe a person like me can get something like depression.

"Everything went south at the end of my year 2018 2018 is probably the quickest year that I've had, the joy, sadness, struggles made me question my existence.

2018 is one of the best yet depressing year I've had. My sister turned 1, I've got a job that I desperately needed, I've learned how to stand up on my own and started to feel like a new better person than I was before, but all of that was washed away before my very eyes. I saw myself building up that person I wanted to be and now I'm terrified that I'm tearing that apart. I became selfish and started to think more of myself than my sister and mom who needed me the most, I chased people who's just there for my company and nothing else. I was at the very down point of my life when I got ignored by a girl I liked at work, I accepted that and moved on, I learned from it, and so I thought. But it never stopped there, I've caught up with an old acquaintance of mine which I've liked before and even now. So we went out a couple of weeks and at the very end I was once again put aside. What's wrong with me.

That's not the real reason why I'm feeling down.

I discovered the real reason when I was all alone. The day I was asleep a guy knock on my door, it's the mailman, he gave me aletter that says I've bought an illegal item, a butterfly knife, I admit it that I've bought it not knowing it's illegal in this country.

I've kept it as a secret from my mom, never told her this until yesterday, December 31st 2018, they gave me another letter which is the same with the first one. My mom was shocked, I was scared and was muted, I didn't know what to say. I just ignored her and I went out.


We're financially struggling and the job I've had before was no longer. They gave me achance to pass my resignation letter but I didn't have the time to. My time was occupied by sleeping everything away, I tried to fight it and be productive but the pull is just too strong for me.

She ask me a request before the year ends. It's that I will order us a food from a chinese restaurant to serve as our feast for the new years eve.

I didn't do that, instead I went out and played in an internet cafe spent all the hours there, I've ignored again my mom, I've ignored her calls and texts. When I was done it was already late, little much too late. I didn't order anything. So I decided to not show up in the house and went back in the computer shop. And now I'm feeling the heaviness of the guilt. It's too much I don't want her to see me. Yet I want her to forgive me. And even if she will, I don't know if I can forgive myself. Even if she will forgive me, it's just. If I'll ask or tell her it's not the whole story, I can only give her small part of the picture.

I'm too frustrated to do or think about anything. Please I need help and advice.

If anyone who lives in Canada that knows about the law please feel free to share me what you know, or for those who had experienced the same please tell me how you dealt with it.

I actually bought 3 butterfly knife and now I'm afraid the agency will believe my story",Depression

"One whole year I don't know if this will help anyone but I would like to share my experience with being suicidal and the long journey I took to over come that deep darkness.

I lost someone close to me, my best friend I grew up with, my favorite cousin, suddenly. I can still replay everything in my head, that whole night from beginning to end. I lost my long time pet that same year too. It was a double blow that brought me to my knees and a knife to my arm. I wanted to have peace, to have a moment that I wasn't crying or wishing I were numb. I was unemployed and forced to move back in with my parents. Another blow to my ego. 34, single, living at home and unemployed. 

My therapist was days away from having me institutionalized but I got a call from an old family friend. He said he had a job opening but I had to apply and go before the council if I wanted it. I applied half heartedly, lacking any confidence in myself but put my best face forward during the interview. It was stressful, I was the youngest applicant and just knew I didn't get the job. I even left early to go to our family Christmas party thinking they would give it to someone else. I nearly cried when I got the call I got the job. 

From that point on, I have tried to put my best foot forward. Even if I lost another cousin, even during the stressful days I still find the strength to get out of bed. Sure some days I don't but they are few and far between. I have a goal now. It's one I set in February last year, to move to Hawaii. One of the most expensive places on Earth far from my tiny Oklahoma town. 

My point of all this is when things seem to be their darkest there's still light to be found. I just want my story to bring some hope to anyone who's lonely tonight, who might have that knife pressed deep into their arm crying out for help. Your past is just a shadow cast by the light that's in your future.

"This year was miserable for me This year was miserable for me as a whole. My whole life being only 16 Ive never felt more alone.

I went to my first party around that time and didnt like how it went. I told my friends I dont like to party and they dont talk to me anymore. My good friends who Ive been friends with for 5+ years left me.  All they do to come over is to pickup my brother and go party on weekends.

Ive never felt so abandoned and I didnt know how to react to it. In order to escape my loneliness I sit on my Xbox for hours talking to guys I met who live elsewhere. I play roughly 8 hours a day on weekends to where it has become a severe addiction. From this my grades dropped, and my parents have taken away the Xbox.

The people on Xbox were the only ones Ive talked to for awhile. I told my parents the people I played with went to my school but as Ive said none of them do. As of right now I only talk to one person, my neighbor. We play basketball daily which is the only escape I get from my loneliness.

I feel so ungrateful for feeling so lonely and glum as I am right now and for letting substance abuse (in this case a lack thereof) affect how I feel.

My mom doesnt understand that sometimes I just dont do my schoolwork. Or my subconscious purposely looses things on me to make me fail. Or that maybe I sleep in because I dont see the point in getting up

My counsellor said that itll all be over by Christmas. (My boyfriend was accused of rape by my bestfriend and its ruined our lives) But it isnt. I was doing well for a week and a half. No huge anxiety attacks. I could get myself to work without being practically pushed out the door

My ex bestfriend (diff??rent than the accuser) told the principal I attempted suicide landing me in counselling. It was fine at first. Just retelling my life whatever. 

But now its like she picks apart everything
And Im so dependent on this lady I dont even know
Every Tuesday. But then she misses a week. Or I miss a week. And life feels like shit

Im back to being depressed I just want to sit in the dark and die
Just die in my sleep let them all deal with a funeral and crap.

My brain is tired. I want to cry and I want to release my emotions but I'm so numb.

"fuck you 2018 obscure post but idgaf. 2018 was, by all means, the worst year of my life. let's check my stats! (all /s)

trips to inpatient: 3

suicide attempts: 2ish

medical bills: \~$47,000

traumatic events: lol who knows i don't remember most of my childhood 2018 is a fucking guessing game but i bet it was a lot!

estranged friendships: about all of them

breakups with the one person that loved you unconditionally and held you accountable and seemed to give a shit because you're a such selfish and self-destructive piece of shit that even the most understanding and patient person on earth had enough of your amnesia bullshit: 1

diagnoses of mental disorders:  5 - depression, anxiety, gender dysphoria, panic disorder, depersonalization-derealization disorder

new meds: 4 (paxil, xanax, that one antidepressant that starts with a c, and prozac) 

well, that's a lot of damage! let's check your achievements, shall we? 

\-started self-harming!! congrats to your upper thigh!

\-multiple episodes of amnesia, including one where you woke up in your partner's ex's bed naked. wow

\-started *living* at the ex's house because your s/o kicked you out of the house that htey were the only one that had a room to spare, adding insult to injury to your poor s/o

\-got into a prestigious university, and are now about to flunk out of it

\-and guess what? you can't remember the rest of it because all the shit that happened means that your entire sense of self and the world around you was trampled on.

well, i'm getting drunk. cheers, folks!",Depression

"You're the Worst (Taking to Myself) Look at you.


You're a full-grown adult man with a professional job and you have the maturity and emotional competence of a child.


No matter what other people tell you, you know what the truth is. You know how much of a disgusting leech you are, how awful you must be to be around. 


You're never going to change. You're going to always bring others down until they have the sense to cut you off. You have very few friends now and all of them must see you for the pathetic stagnant man-child you are.


You claim to care about people, how you would rather drown alone that drag others down. But if you really did, you would act like nothing is wrong so you would not affect them. But you don't do that, do you? You make a conscious effort to show and scream how much of a pathetic sack of shit you are and you get your filth on everyone and everything. You just want the attention. You don't want to change. 


You are fucking disgusting. 


You've been given countless strokes of luck and advantages and you have wasted everything. From your life, your body, your standing, everything. You are a fucking waste.


You deserve everyone to tell you how fucking worthless and parasitic you are and for everyone to give up on you. 


That Kendrick song is true for you, too. You fucking failure, the world don't need you.

"Being crushed by past ghosts I've not seen my nephews in close to three years. Aiden, Ashton and Noah were their names. For a long time I was the one caring for them because my brother is a criminal and the mother was less than ideal. I would switch up with my mom taking care of them during the week and their mom would pick them up on occasion. I did the best I could or that's what I told myself at the time. They were wild and rambunctious, so different than I was at their age. I grew up without a father so I had no real point of reference as to how a man should teach a child. I tried to be firm with them, I thought they needed a strict authority figure. I was a moron, I gave them discipline and structure but was sparce with my affection. Being brutaly honest with myself, I also did not contain my temper. Harsh words were waiting for every infraction or mistake they made. I was in my mid twenties and had just got my house and had taken on new responsibilities at work. Instead of being an adult and dealing with my problems, I just buried it down and let it fester. The pressure had mounted on my back and in return I turned that wrath on children who were desperately looking for approval and kindness.

  I have very little doubt that they held hate and fear of me in their heart. Even as I told myself I was doing what was right for them, the downcast look they had when I went to pick them up let me know deep down I was failing them. It was not all terrible, we did have our good times as well, as rare as they were. In the good times, times I gave them what they truly needed, we would laugh and their faces would light up. Watching movies, playing games, even just hanging out at home. In those moments I felt like we were a family. Being the fool I am however, I never realized that acceptance was what they needed not a godddam drill instructor.

 I hadn't even managed to realize how important they had become to me. I took for granted the feeling of being a family. Then their mother showed back up one afternoon, shuffled them into her car and I have not seen them since. It wasn't some dramatic event, no tearful goodbye or raging argument or fight. I simply waved goodbye, with no idea that would be our last.

 That brings me to tonight. I'm not so selfish as to think on how they about me. I have accepted that my anger has poisoned any love or memory they may still hold for me. What weighs on me is their wellbeing and happiness.  On nights, my thoughts drift to them and it feels like my chest is being crushed as worry wreaks havoc on my mind. I do not know what I want from making this post. All I know is that tonight was worse than most. ",Depression

My mother was talking to my uncle a few hours ago. I wasn't listening too closely but I guess they were talking about some friend of his that either tried to kill himself or said he was going to or something, I'm not too sure. Either way, they were talking about someone and suicide.

My mom comes out with this gem: ""Someone killing themselves is selfish and in my honest opinion if they were thinking like that, then they should just go and do it.""

She's said this opinion of her's before, but that was before I had told her about what was going on in my head. That I had suicidal ideations. I had said this to her months ago but I guess she forgot or something. I hadn't said anything to her. I don't know if I have the courage to. Maybe if my uncle wasn't standing there I would have, but it's all passed now.

I wouldn't do anything but it seriously hurts me. I know she doesn't think that of me, but how could she forget what I said? Especially of this subject. I'm a pretty forgetful person and have the memory of a slug but even I wouldn't such an important thing.

"If I didnt have friends or family, I might be posting in /r/suicidewatch instead. I just turned 30 a few minutes ago, and I'm spending my New Years alone in bed in a city away from my friends because I had to move in with my parents.

I recently betrayed the person that meant more to me than anybody else in the world and completely shattered her heart and trust. All because I wanted somebody else to talk nicely to me instead of me manning up and breaking up with her first like I should have. You can check out my post history if you want the details.

The realization I had within the last half an hour that once we settle our house in the next couple months, there's going to be a day where I never see or hear from her again, and the sadness is almost too much to bear. 

I dont have an overly strong relationship with my family, but I know that if I took my life, it would destroy them, as well as my friends, and I can't accept causing any more harm to people I care about. That's literally the only thing keeping me around right now. The pain I've caused is almost too much to bear and while I won't kill myself, I just really wish I was dead, you know? I know my loved would still be devastated, but if I just passed away in my sleep, they can at least know it was natural causes and that it was my time.

Just before I woke up this morning, I had a dream where I woke up from a dream with my head in her lap and her hand on my head and the last month was just imagined. Then I actually woke up. So now I end the day the same way it started; crying over the ruination I've created.

And despite all of these things which should make me at the very least content, I feel like I'm dead. The only feelings which seem to permeate the fog are contempt and misanthropy, and so I do my best to hide those. Why am I like this? I finally have reached all the goals I had, the things and people I thought would make me happy. But I still struggle to find motivation or reason to do anything in life. I don't even feel the passionate negativity of anger or grief, just a constant numbness. No suicidal impulses, but I honestly wouldn't mind if i died, and I idly contemplate death often. I simply don't know why I feel like this, or how to make it stop. It feels like I cant even properly be emotionally available to anyone, because there simply isn't anything there.",Depression
"I posted this in r/bipolar, but it relates here as well. I hate my life, and I'm about to ruin my 6 year relationship. My bipolar diagnosis has changed from bp2, mixed episodes, and bp1. But, I mainly deal with the depressive side.

?

Over the past 2 1/2 - 3 years, I've changed. For the worst. I'm not ambitious or motivated like I used to be. I can't hold a job for more than a few weeks to a few months. I can barely get myself out of bed a lot of times, let alone do housework.

?

My fiance is a very ambitious, motivated, and hard worker. That's one of the main reasons we got along so well in the beginning of our relationship. But... I'm not that anymore. I don't do shit. I'm not fun. I'm basically a shell of a person dissociating through life.

?

We broke up, technically. But we're spending this month working on ourselves, our wants and needs out of the relationship. Basically, all I have to do is work consistently, do more around the apartment to keep it clean, and be ambitious about SOMETHING, passionate, that I'll work toward to get better. I KNOW I'm capable of doing all those things, but I can't take that first step past the wall of depression to start in on bettering myself.

?

I want to be the mindaq I used to be 3+ years ago. I want to have purpose in life, something I'm striving for. Full of love and appreciation that I once gave so much to my fiance. I want to enjoy the things I used to do. But I don't know how to do that.

?

If anyone can relate or has any tips, I would LOVE to hear them. Because this is my last chance to make our relationship work. And I DON'T want to lose him.",Depression
"dont want my birthday to happen my birthday is in less than two days and i wish i could skip over it. its gonna be so fucking hard dealing with this constant dread over my head and its just so overbearing to the point that i cant even try to make it better anymore. i honestly truly think that i should be fucking dead because im such a terrible person. ive been snapping at my boyfriend because i feel like he doesnt really understand the things that make me
upset. hell make one mistake and let it ruin his whole day, talk about how he should die, throw things, yell, and twitch when hes driving and i just cant deal with it. i told him i dont mind the mistake, i mind how toxic he reacts to them. it doesnt matter. now i just end up getting mad. i feel like nothing is going to get better. im trying my best not to cut my legs up again. im at work typing this right now and ive spent the last fucking hour crying and trying to hide it. i feel like

"I dont know what subreddit to post this on. I think I may be pregnant. But it is also extremely unlikely because I havent had my period in over a year due to a hormonal imbalance. I went off of birth control a little while ago (was put on to regulate hormones) and everything just seems to coincide perfectly in terms of timing and all that. 
Two days ago I began to experience a number of symptoms of early pregnancy. One of which is alcohol intolerance. I hold my liquor well, but I woke up with the worst hangover of my life. And I didnt even have that many drinks. I have been nauseous for two days straight, absolutely no appetite. 

What scares me the most is that there is something inside of me that wants to be pregnant ONLY to reassure myself for the future - that I AM fertile. Because that is one of the main reasons I have been depressed for the past two years. I feel broken. I dont actually want to be pregnant, I do not want a baby right now.

"Ok here is my life story I'm currently on a alt account that I won't have ties to ever again because I'm to ashamed of everything but this is what I'm going to right to my best friend of 12 years that i moved away from, honestly I have no idea why I'm posting this and I might delete it later but here it goes 

""90% of my life changed this day, and I've told lies to you so you didnt see me differently

Please dont tell anyone this, my parents my brother and sister are the only ones that know 

my Biological dad and his family dont even know any of this because I'm to ashamed of talking about it so I cut them off 

Here it goes 


Well it all started when I left NY, I had to redo 8th grade got my first real Gf and did the the firsts like hold hands, kiss, bj, sex ect. Then last day of school I got dumped and I cut all ties and closed everyone off ie my ""Acquaintances""

Then high school started and since i cut everyone off they wanted nothing to do with me so i became lost, skipped school worse then ever before weeks at a time sleeping all day and everything 


Then I got left back again in 9th and started to realize that I was drifting of by my self so I told my parents and they tried to get me help but nothing was working

ie doctor drugs talking to a Specialist and everything 

So then I just didnt care for anything besides my escape from reality gaming with you and or destiny 

2 years pass 


I dropped out of school and was becoming very dark thinking of the unthinkable 

Fast forward another year and I've become 180 pounds and we found some meds that dont make me feel depressed but it makes me gain weight also the only time I would go out is to get my meds or talk to the doctor so like 2 days a month = 28 days of no human Socializing


So now I'm stuck with no high school diploma over weight ugly and to afraid to interact with anyone out side of my house 


Now that you know please dont treat me differently you and few other people are all that I have also I've known you for so long that I know you would feel like it's your duty to help me and it's really not, please dont worry or anything like you have to talk to me on a daily basis because remember how many breaks we took and I'm still here 


I dont want to become a chore to you just hang with me when you feel like it ""

"Were you ever normal? I just realized how I know what normal is but not in the first person.

Just curious if some people were normal but eventually they got trapped in depression or similar mental illness.

Always been like this,I was somewhat ok before like 10yrs old but not since. Life has been finding ways and excuses to make it just a little bit more,because death is irreversible. 

When I say normal I don't mean being happy all the time or even being happy at all. I mean not being socially and emotionally crippled. Being able to form social relationships and having some prospect of a life that extends beyond survival.

I just don't know if this is normal or the exception. Is depression inability to cope where normal people cope?

"I need to get this of my chest/crying like a b This turned out way longer than expected, sorry! 
(FYI English isn't my first language) 

Just now, I sat down on my bed and bawled my eyes out, pressing my face hard into a pillow so I don't wake my sister in the other room. It just came over me suddenly, this overwhelming feeling of loneliness and zero self worth. I felt pathetic. 

It's been around three months since I last started uncontrollably sobbing, and thought about suicide, but it all came flooding back now. I really wanted to ""accidentally"" cut my self earlier when making dinner, or make scratches on my wrist. Again, pathetic.

I should mention that about three months ago I started kind of seeing someone(a colleague). It's amazing how a little physical contact can rewire your brain, suppressing bad thoughts and instead boost happy chemicals in your body. Everyone at work kept telling me how I seemed happier, guess I walked around sulking before..?

But I guess my insecurities got the best of me. I haven't gotten hold of him for around six days. At all. He doesn't use social media, seldom answers texts or calls and often turns of his phone. He does this often(with everyone), so I shouldn't think too much of it.

But my lord, my brain won't stop. I can't sleep and I'm constantly thinking about him during the day. He's technically not even my boyfriend, as we haven't talked about that stuff. I just can't stop imagining him with some girl. Or that he's tired of me and blocked my number. 

I know he's moving, literally, today, so he's been busy. He probably doesn't have internet yet. Another colleague said that he told him he was really sick around two days ago, so that as well.

I assume that my body has gotten used to the skin contact, and now that it's lacking, stress and loneliness has just been slowly building up. I just feel so ridiculous and pathetic. I keep telling myself that there's no point stressing over this, it happens often and so far has always been fine. Doesn't help much.

Thank you for reading. This was quite therapeutic, just writing down what I'm thinking. I feel a bit better. Again, thanks.",Depression

"My parents make me feel like a loser. I want to say first that Im currently feeling okayishù, Ive been on meds an constantly working on myself to avoid falling into that pit again. So although Im currently not feeling suicidal and somewhat functional, I wouldnt exactly say Im enjoying life, but as I said, I guess Im actually okay today. But that wasnt the case last year, Ill save you the time and tell you that in a nutshell I ended up in the hospital for my mental health.

Second (and Im saying this in a humble tone) I come from a very wealthy family (and thats all Im going to say about that mater), and although it may look like a benefit at first sight, it puts a lot of pressure from your parents to continue their legacyù.

Anyways, Ive been trying very hard to recover for the year that I lost due to mental illness, and I mean hard as in the hardest thing Ive ever done in my meaningless life, but my parents dont seem to appreciate my efforts at all. 

I used to feel that my parents were proud of me, and that I could actually live to their expectations, but that changed completely after my mental breakdown from last year. They very subtly make comments that project disappointment, comments like this one my dad made  Well I cant make all of them goodù referring to me in comparison with my brothers, or sometimes not even subtle at all, especially my mom that really says what she believes when shes angry and telling plain on straight uselessù. 

But what I really dont understand is why. Ive tried so hard for the past six months to become the guy that I used to be. I did really well at uni this semester, I went back to the gym, I keep a healthy diet, I even got my first job but I still havent heard an Im proud of youù 

Tbh I dont know why Im writing this, I guess Im mad at them for putting unrealistic expectations on me. Expectations that dont even align with my values yet I follow them because Im terrified of disappointing them.

"When did you know first know you were depressed and when did you decide it was time to get help? Hi there. I had a bit of a revelation recently that I think I might not be as okay as I once thought I was. 
I have noticed a massive decline in myself recently. At first it was just at night where I would get stuck on some trains of thought I desperately did not want to be thinking of. They lead sometimes to a panic attack or tears and happen more nights then not, unless I am just exhausted and fall asleep without time to think.

This has made me become tired most of the time when I am awake, but I realised that the tiredness/fog didn't go away even if I got a good night's sleep. Now even when I'm at work I just feel I wanna be in bed but at the same time I don't cos being alone is when things are worst. I'm quiet at the best of times but now im literally avoiding my co-workers cos I don't feel like I have anything to say to them, even though part of me wants to speak to them about anything. 

Even when I am with my girlfriend I get these bouts of just wanting to not do anything and I feel so guilty about it, like I should be better. I feel I should be better but don't know how to be. I've tried eating better, I drink way less than I used to and I tried meditating. If anything things are worse now then before this. 

I don't know if this is a rut, or I need help, but I'm scared that if I go to a doctor's it will be an official thing and I'm scared of how this will effect my mum. She will think she is a failure even though this has nothing to do with how she raised me. 

Sorry if this is a bit ranty. I'm a bit all over the place atm and feel free to tell me to shut up if you think that this is the wrong place to post this.

"Nobody talks about when mental illness ruins your life. I've been working at my job since August. It's just a retail job, nothing special. They have this rule that you can miss 12 days of work a year and after that you are fired. I have been there five months and I've missed 9 days. Some of the days were missed due to car issues. The rest were because I couldn't muster up the will to get out of bed. I don't care about anything. And it's fucking up my life. At this rate, especially since winter is the hardest for me, I'm going to loose my job. While it's a replaceable job and retail work is not hard to find, I'm worried that if I get fired I won't care enough to get another one. And this isn't even the only aspect of my life that's getting fucked up.

I miss or almost miss every deadline that comes my way. I'm at a community college right now and I can't handle the most simple tasks. I was late on almost every assignment, I almost missed registration for next semester, and I fucked up getting my tuition paid so I had to borrow $1,000 from my family. I have to finish my portfolio to apply to a university by February and I don't think I'll do it. Because I don't care about it. Not because I hate my major, or don't love what I do but because I lost all interest in everything. 

It's my responsibility to get help, I know. But it feels like it's gotten so out of hand that it can't be undone.

"""Just move away from your parents!"" You probably want to hear my sob story as much as I want to tell it -- not at all.

I'm just feeling frustrated because my friends' consensus is that I'd recover from my mental illnesses much better if I moved away from my somewhat abusive parents. Which I agree with. I would probably be less stressed if I did not live with them.

The problem is that I am not stable enough to live completely on my own. There are other complicating factors, like the fact that I take 9 different prescription medications throughout the day (my body hates me as well). I can't really guarantee that I'll be able to get my meds if I'm couch surfing or if I suddenly decide to move cross country.

The biggest hurdle is that I have a piss poor grasp of basic emotional regulation because of mentioned child abuse.

I really don't want to end up in a psychiatric ward, hospital, or jail in the event that I have a meltdown that scares other people (I don't hurt others, but sometimes self-harm because it takes the extreme feelings away).

I love my friends, but it comes down to the fact of ""Well, I did it (under a completely different set of circumstances), so you should do it too!""",Depression

"Antidepressant info and rant Hey, guys. Im curious as to how being on antidepressants has affected any of you that take them. Tomorrow I finally have an appointment to figure out what antidepressants I need to start taking and Im not entirely sure what to expect from it. 

On another note, my depression has made me increasingly reckless and just very I dont give a fuckù for the past few months, so if anything can help I hope its that. Its gotten to the point where I dont care about my appearance and fixedù what I wanted to be an undercut by shaving a part of my head. Just 30 minutes ago. Ill be wearing hats for a while. If I was a dude Id just go ahead and shave it all off, but I dont want to pull a Britney since Im not. The problem is, besides fucking up my hair, I wouldnt have done this shit a year ago. 

I feel ugly and use patheticù to describe myself most of the time. It certainly doesnt help that I havent gone to the gym in a while, and my new stretch marks keep me from wanting to go. This wouldnt be such a problem, but I moved and the gym here is always full of young attractive fit people that make me feel bad. What sucks even more is having to watch people slowly become less attracted to me over the years until I understood why. I have the personality of a stale saltine cracker around most people and overall look pretty bland and chubby.

I also failed 3 college classes my very first semester so that just adds on to my view of myself as a loser. I promised my parents I would do everything I could to pass my classes and actually put in effort instead of giving up this semester, but Im really not looking forward to going back feeling even worse than last semester. My class schedule is a lot better and I plan to keep myself in the library for as long as I can working on stuff as soon as I can. But I also have to get a job.

Every second of my life is a lie
Every laugh is fake
And every smile is self made
Tell me why the thought of a gun to my head seems perfect
Even though I know it's not worth it
Tell me why I want to take these pills
Just so I can't feel
Tell me why I drink till I can't feel
Or why I get high till nothing is  real
Why is it so hard to even get out of bed
All so I can lay down and feel dead
Why is it so hard to go and be
Even though I truly do want to be seen
Why do I want to stay away from my friends
Even though I don't want them to know, inside I'm dead
Somebody please tell me why life is all pain
And why nobody will understand if I try to explain
Please tell me why everything always in pain
Even though I try to tell myself it's in vain
I wish I had the guts to take it all away
And just not exist and just lay

"How do you fix issues rooted in a past you cant remember? So, i have suffered from several mental illnesses, AvPD being one of the big ones, Depression, OCD, PTSD few others. I have had thousands of hours of therapy, in and out of mental hospitals and went from unstable to stable. I have managed to root out roughly when all my problems started. Age 12. do too extreme bullying-Some doctors suspect i have PTSD from the bullying. I managed to put it all behind me (so i thought) until my mental breakdown at age 21. The thing is, my memory simply is... broken, from all the bullying in homeschooling age 12-14, i simply dont remember. I can track the root of my issues, the lack of self worth, the anxiety, the depression, the mistrust, the desperation to be liked by everyone, the fear of criticism to age 12. I have one friend from middle school who remembers the bullying and a lot of details, yet i... i simply dont. I mean i KNOW i was bullied, i have a few memories but mostly its just ""i was made fun of"" or ""i was beaten up a few times"", i DO remember going to bed crying praying for death, i do remember having almost no friends. But thats it, which is the main reason i even know my bullying was bad because why i go to bed crying praying for death if it WASNT. seriously. My friend from middle school, T, said he wasnt surprised when i mentioned i may have PTSD from that time, he would talk about how bad it was. He could tell me about these horrible things that happened to me, and to me he could be making them up, but im positive he isnt. I have tried to straighten my life out, i live on disability and have become stable. But i cant manage to make any more progression. I have hit a point of simple apathy and stagnation. I suspect some of it comes from feelings of not thinking i deserve to be happy and a bunch of other stuff, all of which stems from self worth which was mostly affected in middleschool. I have tried to simply accept that im an adult (now 30) and that i should be able to make/change my life and become happy, but its like building a house in a swamp. Everytime i try and build, the foundation gives out and i end back at square 1. I dont know if its possible to move forward without rebuilding everything from ground up. But at this point... i dont know how. How do you fix issues that formed who you are, to the core, when you cant remember it, and HOW cant i remember it? you would think things so important would be easy. My memory is one of the worst i have ever met, I dont remember when it got so bad, but even things from last week i tend to not remember, stories from past my family tell me i dont remember, highschool i dont remember much, my one relationship (5 years) has some memories but i would expect id have more- but again, its REALLY hard to compare if i have a bad memory or a normal one, because everyone is different. to me it FEELS like mine is terrible. I have been in and out of dozens of mental hospitals and again, its like a mist. I Know the facts that i have been there, but i cant tell you many stories from them.

To go along with my memory is my attention, which also is almost 0. But not from like ADHD, i just dont... notice things or keep a thought. Like my parents can go ""pick up the clothes on the stairs when you go upstairs"" and 30s later ill go upstairs ill walk right past the clothes, not notice them, not remember my parents asking me.

"I cant wait to die I made this account just for this.
My life is great. 

My parents are perfect, not towards each other but at least they were with me.

My sister has her flaws, which I deeply hate, the selfishness and borderline narcissism with an ounce of obsession with the fact that someone told her she may be a gifted child (23 now). But she is my soulmate.

I used to have friends, but now I have 1, my best friend and I dont think I like her that much.
My boyfriend is an angel. He kept me alive for the 4 years Ive been knowing him, but he doesnt know.

I love animals. I thought about being a veterinarian, but it would crush me. I could never stand it.

I think I have always been that way, ?Æ?ˇhappy?ˇ?Ø but not fond of being alive, with happy meaning that I didnt really have anything to complain about.
My mom always told me that children never ask to be made, they are just a product of 2 peoples mutual wish. And I live by that.

I am a severe migrainer. Not the worst but its chronic, and its driving me insane, but I am taking well care of it. 

I always told myself the depressing thoughts would pass, since I was maybe 13. Its just puberty, wait for the holidays, wait for the end of exams, wait until the migraine is gone, wait until you pass your first year of college. It never did pass (neither did I *lol* )

And here I am. I think Im not in that bad of a mental state if I am still capable of being aware that something is wrong and capable of telling myself that I have to reach out to professionals. Is that true?

Since this started, I immediately thought of how sad my mom would be if I did disappear. So I told myself that I was going to find a reason to live, even if my family and friends are, according to my shitty brain, not that good of a reason.

I did find one. I want to be a doctor. I want to live for my job. I want to work 70 hours a week, and only have thoughts about my job. I want it to be my life, because that is what I was made for since I myself didnt ask to be there. 

But my country decided it was not going to be that easy. They decided to turn college into a competition. You have to be better than 90% to pass. And I am not that smart, mind you I was not the gifted child out of the 2 my parents made. I did my best, and failed.
We are allowed to try once more when we fail.

I get the results next week.

It is not going to be enough. I know it and I know it because I can not imagine myself being happy. It is out of what is possible for me, like imagining a new colour ?

If I cant have my job, then I believe my time is done here. I honestly wish we had a switch to turn off and die. I am not scared of regret, because the thoughts never left anyway...

I dont know if I want advice, I know I am not going to change my mind about making my life around a job I will never practice. It is what it is, and if I cant have it, its okay, they didnt need me.
My mom also says that if I fail, it was meant to be, because it would have been terrible if I passed. I could never think like that no matter how hard I tried.

"I don't know what to do about school. I'm a high school student and almost going to turn 17. I've had depression and social anxiety as long as I can remember but has expanded more frequently in the past 4-5 years. I desperately don't want to go back to school after Christmas break. I've hated every single day of this Junior year and I just can't take it anymore, not even a single day. I missed a week of school before Christmas break for a family vacation which I loved more than anything and with that missed week I received a lot of homework that I got it mostly done but still have some assignments left which make also make me fear of going back and having my grades go down. I hate the people some being jerks and others treating me like a retard, I barely have any friends as I was very unlucky with the classes I got and only have one friend in one of my classes, the rest are just acquaintances. I sit alone at lunch while I listen to music hoping no one notices my pathetic nature. I have a bully in APUSH that constantly finds any way to make fun of me and I come back at him but he still has more self-confidence in himself so he won't back down. Teachers I hate as they show no mercy as they give me hours of homework so that I have no time to follow my passions and desires of finding a job, playing the guitar, get back into playing basketball and working out. I always feel awkward around people around school as I can't think of things to say that people actually care about. I feel so pathetic and hate the way I look with this new atopic dermatitis eczema that just had to come up and give me dehydrated skin and substantial red spots on my neck and chest, pimples all over my face, wavy hair, childlike face, pale skin, big butt. I feel like I have no reason to live and I can't find any solution except for suicide, I've tried online school in 8th grade and I remember hating it as I could cheat on half of the stuff and I couldn't stand sitting in the same seat watching a choppy grainy video of a live teacher and I would be the joke of the family and friends as people treat those who do online school as freaks ",Depression

I think I might have mild/moderate depression Sometimes it just hits. For me it's not constant its just a sledgehammer picking at my brain. Distractions build a wall around my mind but when I'm alone or when something sheets or saddens me its like a light switch and suddenly I'm not happy. I feel empty like a carcass that can move. Sometimes when it hits I just lie in bed and stare at the ceiling unmoving pondering what is won't with me and what is won't work my life. I'm terrified of being alone but I dont want to see anybody. I'm not suicidal at all but terrified of life. Well not live really more just the fact that my life is not going to amount to anything. I see all these characters in books and movies going on these incredible adventures and I look at my life and what it will become and I get incredibly well depressed. I also get sad when I think of girls and I think how I'll never have someone who cares about me as much as I care about them. I get frustrated about my height and face.

"I just feel bad This is my first reddit post and thought it could belong here. So, to introduce myself, I'm a 16 year old guy, never been diagnosed with depression, but have been strugling with lots of sadness for over the past half year.

I'm a decent student, have great family, lots of friends and even a girlfriend. My life has been pretty average, but it all changed around 7 months ago, when I started to feel really sad. Everyday I would have these deep thoughts about how worthless my life is. It appeared out of nowhere. Since then, literally almost everyday, I've been on the edge of crying and just thinking what am I still doing here. Yes, I've been thinking about suicide a lot. But have come to a conclusion that that's not a way, although to this day I still think about it a lot. I don't know what to do, feeling this sad every single day, it's really tough.

The worst thing is that I have everything I could ask for, as I said friends, great family, lovimg girlfriend. But even though I do realize this, I can't help myself but be sad and think about how worthless everything is. I'm starting to feel sick and tired of everything.

"Do the holidays just suck? I'm 21 years old and I don't feel a damn thing during the holidays. 


When I was a kid, Christmas had this aura around it that filled me with joy. I love Christmas! I had no school, I could sleep in, play video games, and on Christmas day I would get presents!

But now, I'm in college. The Chistmas spirit died out years ago. 

The video games and sleeping is, in my parent's eyes, an activity not fit for a 21 year old. My parents and family now bug me about why I don't have a job yet, or harassing me about doing nothing. So my days are filled with either completing job applications or being filled with guilt because I'm not completing job applications. 


I don't seemingly want anything anymore. I don't have any passions and if there is something I want I feel like I have to justify why I wanted this gift and not another one.  

I dunno, I can't seem to enjoy the holidays anymore. I don't know if it's just part of getting older, or if it's depression.

"Can't tell if weed is helping or hurting I've had anxiety and depression for years, also been dependent on weed off and on for years. These days I'll spend months smoking daily (not getting super high, just a little) and on weekend nights. Weeknights I don't because my wife doesn't like it but sometimes I do a little in the basement without telling her.

When I'm a little high I feel more focused, happier, more motivated, and more interested in what I'm doing, including my work (most days of the week I work from home). 

But I get so dependent on it. I'll wake and bake and plan my days around when I can smoke next. If I have to take a break during the week, I think a ton about when I'll be able to get high next. It becomes the best thing and the main thing I look forward to, and it makes everything else seem boring.

I've tried a lot of different ways to moderate my use but I'm really bad at self-control. I guess it is kind of compulsive. I don't know how to use it healthily but I also really don't want to cut it out completely because I like it so much. ",Depression

"I dont know what to do Hey guys. I dont think anyone will read this since no one ever does but I need to let it out. 

I am currently in high school, and depression is getting to me really badly. Part of this is because of my frustration with not being able to get a job since I live in the middle of nowhere, and my family has barely any money to pay for me going to college this fall. I made it into my dream college, but the happiness lasted for a few hours and ever since, I havent been able to be happy about it. All I can think of is how Im even going to afford this college. They say money doesnt buy happiness but if I had the money to pay for college without making my parents broke, Id be so happy. 

Im also sick and tired of my moms attitude. She gets mad when she is proven wrong, and is always screaming at my dad for no reason. She also gets mad at me for choosing to lock myself in my room while my sister and her bf are awkwardly cuddling on the couch.

Nearly a year ago my guidance counselor was forced to tell her about me being depressed/suicidal. I didnt even have a say in it. She didnt talk to me about it for a week but after she did, she didnt do anything.

Im forced to hide behind a happy face everyday. Even when people ask how are you?ù I try to say that Im not fine, but I impulsively laugh or brush it off. And now Im having thoughts again about starving myself, which I gained at least 8 pounds back from when I was 100-104lbs and struggling before. I just cant handle any of this anymore.

"feeling like a stranger Hi everyone. F/27.

I recently realized why I feel like shit most of the time. I feel bad because I believe that there is something inherently wrong with me (that I am not normal). That I am not like everyone else and that something is simply wrong with my personality and the way I am wired. And I struggle everyday because I want to feel better so I try to reframe my thoughts, but then, there is a part of me that thinks: why change the unchangeable?

I constantly feel like I am fake and unauthentic. I am constantly repeating that I am a crazy and bad person. It's exhausting.

I don't filter anything I say because I am looking for reassurance by others ... but it never works. And saying things without a filter cause me anxiety.

Anyone else feel this way?

"I'm not really sure where to turn Hi there. I don't really know what to say or how to start this. It will be long and frankly I'm doing this because I don't have anyone to talk to and I need to vent. I need to vent because it feels like I am being crushed.

I recently lost the person I was with for 10 years. I lost her because when I was in my darkest moment, she wasn't there for me and it crushed me. It sent me into a really dark place and I made some bad decisions. I was desperate to find happiness and latched onto the first person who showed me affection and I cheated on my wife. 

I am not happy about what I've done. I am not happy with my actions. I am not happy the past 10 years of my life are now invalid. She left the house, she took the cats, she's onto living on her own while we wait for the house to be sold. 

Not once did I ever stray from her until I did. I've always went above and beyond for her and in the end when I needed her, she wasnt there for me and I feel like I've been broken. 

Um, I don't really know where I'm going with all of this. I guess I kind of realized that since she's been gone that I don't have anyone and I haven't for a long time. I can't talk to my parents. I can't talk to my guy friends since it always turns into their problems. I can't talk to my cousin's. I feel like I have nobody. I was always the person people came to. I was always the ""strong"" guy. I was always the bastion of logical thinking and being rational. I was always the guy who my wife came to when she had a problem. But I never had an outlet in anyone and when I tried to talk to my wife, about anything, her response was ""I can't talk about this right now."" It was like that for 10 years and I always swallowed my problems and tried to make her comfortable because I loved her.

I'm sorry if this is bouncing back and forth. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I've always been the person who people relied upon and I never had an outlet. I made a mistake by cheating on my wife and i hate myself for it. I hate what I had become after I felt like my wife didn't care about me and only used me as her outlet or when she needed something. I hate that when I needed someone the most nobody was there for me.

Now, I'm sitting in my old room at my parents house praying my home sells sooner than later with tears in my eyes because all I can think about is how i fucked up and how everything is falling on me. Just like it always has, only this time it's apparent that I have no one. I haven't heard from any of my guy friends in weeks. The only texts I get are from my realtor and the vile hatred filled texts from my ex wife while we speak about business and only business. 

Ive never had a battle with depression. I've never had thoughts of suicide. But right now, I can't help being consumed by the thought about the mistakes I've made. I can't help but think that this self hatred won't end. 

I'm worried that I will hate myself forever fkr hurting my ex wife in a way I never wanted to and for what I've done. 

I hate how everything turned out. The only  thing I know is that I miss and love my cats. And I miss everything being normal, even though it wasn't a healthy normal. And I miss being happy. 

I've always respected people who battle depression. You are all stronger then you know. I hope every one of you finds the happiness you're looking for. I'm trying to find it myself.

"I've been asked several times in the last year how I cope with my depression so well. I was diagnosed with clinical depression several years ago and I continue to struggle with it daily. Apparently I am a much better at hiding it than I thought. In the last year, I've had several people, including my dad (who is currently battling his new diagnosis of clinical depression) and my best friend among others that don't know me as well.

But the thing is, I don't cope with it. At least, not very well. No one witnesses how no matter how early I go to bed, which it is rare that I fall asleep before 1 or 2, I struggle to get up in the morning. If I don't set several alarms, I will sleep until 12 or later on my days off work. There are times my clean laundry will stay in the basket for weeks until I either fold them or wash them again. There are times I let the dishes pile up and leave things lying around. There are times I go weeks, sometimes months, without sweeping or dusting or cleaning the house in anyway. 

I'm not lazy, despite what most people think. Motivation is like water that slips through my fingers, no matter how hard I try to hold it. Some days I don't want to do anything but sleep. Some days I don't want to do anything but cry.

It's getting much harder lately though.",Depression
"Dealing with loss and not recovering Hello all - New to community and Reddit in general. 

I don't even know what I'm looking for. Advice maybe? Answers? Validation? But here goes anyway. 

I'm currently struggling with a loss, a very significant one. I'm quite familiar with death. I've dealt with it alot, starting at an early age. I've always understood it and have always been able to process it. I've lost all Grand parents, aunt's, uncles, and even kids my own age when I was in high school. It's always shocking, but always something that I knew to be natural. 

But not this time. On November 5th, I lost my fiance. He dropped me off at work and went to run errands. A few hours later, I received a call from his brother. He was dead. Gone. Hit a log truck and killed on impact. And that was it, his life was over. I couldn't accept it. It just wasn't real. Our wedding was just a month away, we were already trying to have kids, and I was just laying in bed with him laughing and planning the rest of our lives. He couldn't be dead. He was invincible. He promised that he'd be here for me always and forever. He'd never leave me alone. 

 I'll never forget finding out. I'll never forget collapsing at work. The feeling that it just couldn't be real. I couldn't stop saying that there must be something they could do. We couldn't give up on him. But he'd been dead for hours and I'd never see him again, not in the casket. The next days are a blur. So many people, so many things, and alot of self medicating. I didn't care what it was, I'd have done anything to not feel the hurt I was feeling. And the hurt was constant. By day, spontaneous fits of crying and telling myself he'll walk through the door any moment now. Nights weren't any better. I dreamt of him, and only him. And so vividly at that. Every morning, I'd have to remind myself he's not next to you. He's gone. I had to relive it every day. 

The people were suffocating. So many I'm sorry's, I know how you feel's, everything happens for a reason's, you'll move on's, and it gets easier with time's. I'm sorry means nothing. No one knows exactly how I feel. There was no reason for this. his death helped no one and meant nothing.This isn't a high school romance that I'll just up and move on from. This was my soul mate, my anchor and the man I was supposed to marry. I don't want to move on. And time. For me, it does not get easier with time.

That brings me here. It's been almost two months. Nothing has gotten easier. I hate this place and I hate everything in it. I still wake up looking for him. I can't do anything, I mean anything, without suddenly crying or having a fit of rage. I don't want to be here and I don't want to get better. I'm incredibly self aware. I'm aware that I'm self destructing. I'm aware that I'm pushing people away. I'm aware that it's wrong for me to self medicate. I'm aware that he'd want me to be happy, move on and heal. I'm aware of all these things, and I don't care. I just don't want to do this anymore. Am I going to go and off myself? No. I'm too much of a chicken for that. But do I want to make an effort to heal, succeed and live my best life? Also no. 

See, he was my best life. Growing up, I didn't have dreams of becoming this or that. I always knew that I just wanted a family. I wanted to meet the love of my life, get married and have my own family. That's the life I wanted and that's what was taken from me. There's nothing else that I want. That was everything that I had dreamt of and worked for. 

I tell people that and I just get the standard what people say stuff. And honestly, it just makes me mad. Who has the right to say what I want or need from life now? Who has the right to decide when I've reached my limit, when I just can't take it anymore? Who has the right to decide when I can and when I can't give up? No one other than me should be able to say or decide those things. 

Again, no. I am not out to end my life. As much as I'd like to be done and be with him, I just do not have the guts to do anything about it. So, as long as I'm here, I'd like to be as least miserable as possible. And there's very few ways to do that. And of those few ways, none would be recommended as a coping mechanism. 

If I have to be here, I should at least be here the way I want. And I want to be able to make it through the day without bursting into tears, without feeling the hole in my chest and without constantly visualizing what his last moments must have felt like. I want to self medicate everyday and just stay numb. If I had something to go on for, plans or dreams to fulfil, this would be a different story. But I don't want anything else. I'm just stuck here living this life day to day, until my time comes. So why shouldn't I be able to deal the way I want to deal? If there's something that I can do that makes me feel better and doesn't hurt anyone else, why shouldn't I be able to do that? Why should I have to be miserable forever? To appease my family and friends? I'm not a selfish person, but that is too selfless for me. I don't want to live my life for them and base all my choices on what they think. They don't even know how I'm feeling. I'm sorry, but they don't always know best. 

Maybe I'm crazy or maybe I make sense to someone out there. I don't know. But what I do know is that everything I loved was taken from me, I'm miserable and angry, I don't want to move forward, and I don't want anything else. I just want him. I want him to hold me. Kiss me. Tell me it's all okay. I want him to argue with me, get on my nerves. Anything. I just want to feel him. And if I can't, then I don't want to feel anything.

"I really dont want to die alone...

"This world is cursed. Living is pain Why do i say that? Oh i don't know, maybe because people are fucking assholes who want nothing more than to hurt you and feel pleasure doing so?

Or maybe because in today's society it is consideres normal to drink alchool, do drugs and have sex without concent regularly? Just look at these damm radio hits that influence that kind of stuff! Or maybe because looks are literally the only thing that matters and people saying ""oh yeah, looks don't matter, personality is what really counts"" when the second after they make fun of that random ugly person in the middle of the street, or say this or that guy looks like a retard? Hell, do you think ALL the famous people, hollywood actors and companies CEOs are, at the very least, decently atractive by coincidence? Now, because looks matter literally everything, and your life will be better in ALL aspects (social, romantic, professional, etc) if you are good looking. On the other end, if you're ugly like myself, you're screwed for life. No matter what you do there is always a better looking person who will surpass you without nearly as much effort.

How about the fact that the small criminals are sent to prision, but the real criminals, like corrupt politicians and bankers who literally steal millions from us barely go to judgement? Because they can buy their way out of it os course. And what about the fact that there is no love? Love is a lie, people are just afraid of being alone and just want to have sex with each other.

Oh, and what about the fact that we'll probably have a job that we hate in the future, but still have to work our ass off in it, until we are either dead or too old to do it? And what about these fake ass people, who says that they like us but in reality hates us? So why are we still living when living in nothing more than pain? Well, because our natural insticts say that killing ourselfs is bad, so we don't the courage to do it. But good is it fucking hard ro live in the shitty world",Depression

"I feel like Im finally winning the battle with anxiety and depression So, on December 31st I started using this lotion-type stuff that is supposed to help calm your anxiety and make you feel more positive. I dont know if it actually worked or if my brain just tricked itself into thinking it worked, but Ive used it every day since then and I have to say I think it really was the final push that kicked me into a battle with my depression, and I think Im winning. Every day Ive used it Ive been extremely positive, and its completely shocking to me considering just last month I was cutting myself and wanting to kill myself. Im sure this confidence and positivity wont last forever, but even if I do fall back into depression I know this success will show me how easily I can get out of it and get back on my feet.

"Just wondering if anyone with depression and anxiety has similar symptoms on their body #SLEEPING DISORDER 
I cant sleep at nighttime, I can be staying up all night and sleep during the day for a long period of time, like literally I havent seen sunlight for two weeks because I go to sleep after sunrise and wake up after sunset and its messing up my hormones

#ACNES &amp; CONSTIPATION
Not sure if its because of sleeping disorder or a poor diet or lack of exercise (movement), acnes are sprouting all over my forehead and cheeks. And my 
bowel movement routine changes from daily to WEEKLY and its literally been a pain in the ass


I know everyone has a different system and deal with depression and anxiety differently. Just wondering if anyone has similar conditions so that we can compare and make adjustments and share thoughts.

My major problems being
1) I barely go outdoors, as social anxiety keeps me away from the outside world, Id go out to dump the rubbish or buy groceries like once a week, and only at night; 
2) I dont sleep at a proper time, almost totally upside down with normal sleeping pattern everyday; 
3) I barely move myself around, either sitting on the floor or lying in bed all day; 
4) I have a poor diet, the irregular sleeping pattern usually makes me skip breakfast and lunch, so I only eat one meal a day, mostly takeaways with no nutrition whatsoever

"Not seeking medical advice, just am curious what antidepressants have worked for you and why? Also, which meds you have taken that have given you the least amount of side effects. Hi all,

I have seasonal depression and major depressive disorder that runs in my family. All of the women in my family seem to have one or the other to some degree and I was luckyù enough to inherit it as well. 

I am 28 and have been consciously dealing with bouts of depression since I was 16. It took me till I was 21 to religiously take medication to try to help with it. I am lucky (no sarcasm this time!) because I can sense/feel when my depression is coming on. I can feel that Im getting down, I notice the symptoms and normally with the medication I am on I could successfully push it away and move forward and I lost this most recent battle and am trying my hardest to get my depression at bay right now. 

Two years ago I was started on Effexor XR at 75mg. It worked great for about a year until I noticed my symptoms were getting unavoidable again. My doctor upped me to 150mg of Effexor XR and here I am again, a year later, in a bad place. Effexor XR really seemed to have the least amount of side effects compared to some other meds I have tried (besides excessive sweating when I am anxious, which I hate because its very excessive). I had tried Effexor XR back when I was 19 but didnt stay on it because young-me hated to take a pill every day and I felt like it wasnt working. 

I have tried Wellbutrin which a lot of people seem to have success with but within the first two weeks I was on it, it made me very snappy and have a 0-100 temper which I NEVER have had before in my life. I am a very patient person. My ears also rang a lot. I was also on Zoloft before Effexor but stopped taking that as it seemed to have plateaued. I was on it from the time I was 20-25. 

I am currently under medical care and am hoping to get in to see my doctor ASAP to switch my meds. It seems like I get side effects pretty badly no matter what type of medication I take (whether it be antibiotics or antidepressants) so I would like to try to avoid ones with extreme side effects as I may likely experience them. The ones I am trying to avoid most are weight gain and sexual side effects. I havent experienced sexual side effects on any of the medications I have taken and pray that it stays that way. Weight gain I just want to avoid since I have gained weight from stress eating on my own accord and dont want to add to it. The current effects I am having from my depression are fatigue, constant negative thoughts I cant shake, disinterest, lack of motivation. So any medications notorious for increasing that may be a no-go as well. I feel like Im hopeless at this point. 

Does anyone have any success stories or unsuccessful stories? I like to know a little about what Im delving into beforehand. Thank you so much for your time. ????",Depression
"Depressed dear redditors, I know the depression you have to live through is already so painful, but help me out. I have a serious ex who recently broke up with me.

I said the worst things like snap out of itù how could you be unhappy if you have meù, etc. freaking terrible right?? It never occurred to me that I could search up things because I was denying that he was truly going through this. I know now. Im being diagnosed with severe depression because of the break up. I know how awful and dark it can be sometimes. And so the relationship ended because my depression made me lose love for youù. Daggers to my heart.

Throughout first and second year, I got all firsts (70s and 80s) with perfect attendance, and was extremely keen hard working student, but since September, Ive slipped dramatically to the point where Im either not coming in or Im leaving halfway through lectures and going home. My grades have slipped, the staff are on my back about my grades and attendance, and even my friends are excluding me. Most days Im sat there and they dont acknowledge me, or ignore me when I do try and contribute to conversation. We used to be such an amazing team, study together, help each other through assignments, but now, when I ask for a bit more help (because Im so vacant right now), I get ignored or they act like they wont help me by avoiding my questions.

I have like 3 friends that I feel close to in school, and Im really dreading the day I have to go to prom or throw a grad party because I know nobody will come. Im just so down in the dumps even though everything is good for me right now ? I got into my dream school and I have something to look forward to. I just cant seem to stop being so bored and unhappy all the time. I thankfully do have a friend I can really vent to, however Im still so depressed.

Im so lost and I am seeing a therapist and thats pretty much the only light in my life right now. One of my friendsù told me that something was wrong with me because Im super hyper around them/in school (joking around a lot, running in circles) just harmless things because thats who I am.

"No point in stressing about the things we can't control, and that's pretty much everything.  I often find myself over stressing or overreacting to the things that I don't have full control of. When I do that, the negative energy is unavoidable, because I don't get to decide whether or not those uncontrollable things should happen to me or not, it just happens. So I thought about it and feel that there's absolutly no point to over stress about those things, and it did help me to be less stress in my daily activities.

"Constantly insecure On top of my depression, I have this weird constant insecurity about specific things. Something I'm not sure if you all feel as well is anxiety about how a night went with someone. I finally left my house and went to a hockey game with the girl I've been in love with since highschool (5+ years). Her parents went with us, and I found her a bit aloof from me even though she repeatedly told me how excited she was for it. After the game on the drive home, she held my hand (which was a big deal for us). 

But after the hockey game, we went to her parents friend's new year's party, where she barely talked to me, and then pretty much ignored me on the drive back from the party. Even though all in all it probably went fine, I have this intense, crippling anxiety about how she might hate me now that she saw me again (first time hanging out in some time due to different colleges). And to top it off, we have not talked the entire day (we have like a 40 day Snapchat streak and she always snaps me at some point in the day, usually the morning) I get some anxiety is probably the norm, but this is so intense I can't even move or do anything. 

I think it hits me the hardest whenever someone shows some interest (her holding my hand) and then shortly after I don't get the validation that everything is okay. Without consent validation that we are doing okay (which she usually gives me by always telling me how much fun she's having etc.) this sortof thing happens How can I handle this. It's one of the most powerful and crippling emotions I have, and I think it's ruined a lot of opportunities I have had.

This morning when I woke up, I was immediately struck with the overwhelming desire to die. Over and over my brain begged me to kill myself instead of go to work. I laid in bed until the very last minute, shrugged on some clothes and made it to the office. I received several comments from concerned co workers asking if I was tired or if I was okay. The whole day, my brain screamed go home and die. Why are you here? Just die already. Today has been overwhelming. I feel the depression in harsh waves, crashing against my defenseless brain.

"Im living an empty pointless life that i know is going nowhere but i cant end it I don't know what to do.  I hate life but not because of only my own circumstances. No matter what you do in life it'll suck. Everything sucks. Existence itself is an infinite nothing that will ultimately die due to its own gluttony. Scientific fact states that the universe will expand so much even the atoms will not be able to come together and form anything. No matter what you try to do that is the finality of everything. And you get back to being on earth and living your meaningless pointless utterly nonsensical life, praying you'll get a promotion or find some way to get rich or hope you get the girl of your dreams. None of it amounts to anything. Everything you do is for nothing. Everything your family does is for nothing. Everything we do in life is for nothing. Humans hate each other. All of your biggest moments in life are nothing. All of your happiness is temporary. Happiness is just a chemical reaction that can be replicated in a lab. Emotions are not real. Your feelings aren't real. Youre just a bundle of small things thinking itself to be more. You believe in fairy tales and gods to save your soul. To make sense of it all when you know in your heart that it's bullshit. You just can't admit it. You waste hours upon hours of your life going to work and getting rewarded with a piece of paper or digital code that we have somehow given value. We poison each other with foods that do not benefit to our bodies or our environment. We have islands of garbage twice the size of Texas. Poverty, crime, war, government. All instruments of our own creation. And somehow we are surprised that depression exists. Before my depression made me sad. But for the past 2 years I've been numb. I can't feel anymore. And when I do it's just the sadness that never leaves. I've tried everything to fill the whole in me. Yet I can't. And I think I know why. Everything I do no matter how hard I try at it will be for nothing. Why does the universe even exist? For no reason at all. Common arguments against the nihilistic point of view I have is ""you have to give life meaning"" If I am birthed into a world where I have to be forced into living, then why am I also being forced with the task of giving the existence I never asked for meaning? I know life goes nowhere and we all will die no matter what. But I can't kill myself. And I don't know why. It's as if something in me holds me back. I just want to die already. Every morning when I wake up and take my first conscious breath I feel like slitting my throat. Every moment of awareness I endure I feel like blowing my brains out. Even now as I'm typing away on my phone I feel nothing but anger at the fact I'm even conscious enough to be alive. I wish I was dead. I'm tired of living. Life means nothing. I hate existing. I wish I had a means to die easily. Something fast and easy. But life isn't easy. And won't give you an easy way out. The universe is a sadist. It enjoys watching and hearing us suffer. It can feel our suffering and it feeds off of it. But ""it gets better"" Right? Yea. ",Depression

Ill be posting here for awhile, maybe just to clear my head.

*Any replies I thank you for reading, and to any one else suppressing these emotions- I hope that you as well find a way out of this abyss. 



Alone... amidst this story. I can feel myself fading. 
Ive never been very experienced with emotions. Throughout my uppering I learnt it was best not to feel at all- my family was always very abusive or simply hardly ever around. My feelings were not their concern.

I grew up in a very small town, population: corn, I was always a misfit in my school- constantly made fun of for every movement I made. School was awful- although.. it was the only place I could ever sleep; Home was worse.
I went to various different schools after grade 6 and still never was able to connect with anyone. I have always spent my time alone, I was always ok with it. 
2015 I dropped out of highschool two months before graduation. Granted I probably would have been held back- for missing the entire year of schooling just before. I could not take it any more.
I moved in with my aunt whom is never home, so Im now in complete solitude. Have been since. I think I like it..
But then I met someone. I gave him my heart too fast. I got involved in a relationship when I was not capable of holding one. Before becoming serious with this man I tried warning him- Im not ok to be in one. But he insisted.. and I really did like him. This interest became love. He is always on my mind. He brought me light into this world. Sure- it may not have been much light, but it was enough to wake me up.

Here I am, again, in the dark. Alone.. fading in this world. I didnt realize it- how I was living..how disturbed I am, until I found the sun- and when I let it go. Being out made me realize Im too far down to look back up. My thought process is messed up. I dont want help- I want it to be ok to let go. Please let me go.",Depression

"I dont know what to do with myself. Hi,I'm new to Reddit so writing this makes me anxious but Im trying to do this anyway. Ok, I've been feeling really bad recently. The past few days I've been dissociating really bad and questioning reality and if I was still here. My depression  was kind of triggered from my boyfriend with some things he did, Which also led to my dissociation. I should probably  mention that I'm schizoaffective  so the hallucinations have been becoming more real . The people from the past are also echoing in my mind. I tried to end it a few months prior  and the people I used to love (friends) now hate me.  I contacted them and told them my intentions and they didnt care , encouraged me even. And words from that night keep coming back to me. So the only one I really have is my boyfriend  and he thinks I'm relying on him much so I feel like I shouldn't tell him as much even though I havent told him every single thing.I dont have a good relationship with my mother aswell. So basically  ,My boyfriends recent actions and dialogue, reoccurring  thoughts of what my mother has said to me, reoccurring thoughts of what the previous close friends has said to me, and being being myself since I'm by myself right now living wise.Im just overall feeling horrible and dont know what to do... it all makes me  I wish I was successful that night. Though I really dont feel like I want to go away",Depression
"I don't really want to do anything in 2019 Today my best friend (who is also dealing with depression) told me she wanted to do a lot of stuff in 2019.
This made me realize that there's nothing in particular I want to achieve this year. 
I dropped out of university last year because I hated it and it made me extremely depressed. I can't see myself ever going back. I can't see myself working either. 
I'm supposed to go to a cooking school in two weeks, but I don't really want to do that either. It feels like I have to, just because at some point I have to stop spending my days in bed. Cooking used to be my passion, but now I'd say it's a hobby, and sometimes a chore. I'm reluctant about cooking school because money is tight, and I'm scared I'll waste my parents' money. I don't want to wake up every day at 8 am, I don't want to stand up all day long, and socializing every day sounds tiring. I'm scared I'll get the same kind of depression I had when I was in college. 

So yeah, there's nothing I really want to do this year. Not even beat depression. 

I'm wondering if I stopped caring because of my medication. I'm on escitalopram 20mg (max dose). It got upped to 20mg around 6 months ago by my psychiatrist because I was still very depressed (even after dropping out). I feel like I experience still all of my symptoms except for the mood ones, where I'm stuck with a more or less neutral mood. 
I wish I could see my psychiatrist, but again, money is tight. If he were to change my medication, I'd need a follow up appointment and that's more money to take out. 
I haven't seen my therapist for 5 months because of money again. 

I feel like there's been progress, but also no progress at all. ",Depression
Too much pain Ive been feeling sad angry for too long now nothing helps My parents know but they have no Idea how bad It really is I have barely any friends I just lost someone close like a month ago and Its hurt me ever since I havent been to school Ever since I tried one day but I couldnt do it Man I just wish It was easy to end It all I havent been really happy ever since I was 10 And Im 14 now I hope someday I try doing and succeed ,Depression

"My 2018 resolution was to kill myself. I didnt. But I tried everything and failed. I want to die. I dont even just want to stop the suffering, I just want to die. There is nothing giving me joy in life. I have tried everything.

I am lonely. I dont have any friends? well, at least no one to talk to. Not like talking has ever helped? I have one single friend that may become a true friendship but nothings settled. Chances are that nothing will even come out of it because of my social incompetence and limited time. 

 I never grew up with a family. I come out of an emotionally fucked household. I moved a lot when I was younger. Came from a different country. Didnt know the language for the most critical phase of social interaction. Came out fucked and without any real friends up until this day. 

 Any attempt to expose myself to raw social feedback where I would re-learn social interactions failed. Partly because of medication. In the end, every attempt I made at approaching people backfired and lead to me becoming even more anxious than I was in the beginning. I cant do this alone anymore. Any way where I would go out to night clubs with a wingman to train my social skills is blocked, just impossible with current logistics. I have no hope of getting better at this currently.

I am also officially smartù. That doesnt matter though. You know why? Because I have problems with concentration and headaches. I cant concentrate for shit. When I cant concentrate, and try to force concentration, I get headaches. Whenever I force myself to do things, I get headaches. I cant train myself to get more concentrated because of the headaches. Its a negative feedback loop. I try to get myself used to concentrate more -I get headache -Direct negative feedback to me trying to concentrate more -negative reinforcement -repeat. 

 One might say, maybe its the nutrition? Okay. Great. I have an (yet) untreatable eating disorder which disallows me to eat any vegetables and most fruits because the texture makes me LITERALLY THROW UP. Ive tried for years now fixing this, gradual exposure doesnt. fucking. Work. 

 Maybe its exercise? Well. Ive tried going to the gym. Ive been for a long time. I went for months on end, and the habit didnt even stick. Why? Because it makes me feel SO FUCKING TERRIBLE, because my nutrition is so shit. Every time I felt my blood sugar fall so heavily that I felt dizzy every single day. Because I just couldnt find a good breakfast. The last day of me going to the gym was marked my me being on the edge of passing out while doing exercises. Ive also tried running, felt terrible. 

 I did a lot of sports when I was younger. I did gymnastics, basketball, ping pong, dancing, judo, karate, soccer, Muay Thai, swimming. Nothing even remotely stuck with me.   
 I dont even have hobbies. I played guitar for 6 years and I recently gave up on playing. Why? Because I cant improve in my playing. My fingers are hyperflexible and as such cant develop muscles without SERIOUS effort. Which would remove any aspect of fun in that activity. I also played piano. Same problem with fingers. Did I mention that I have concentration problems and that any kind of practice is a real drag?   
 Ive played video games. Ive lost interest in them, they just arent fun anymore. I have no hobbies. No activity that provides me with any fun or fulfillment. 

You might ask: Why didnt you seek out help earlier?ù Well. I did. I am in therapy since February 2018. Switched therapists in July. I even was in the hospital for a couple of weeks in August because of a psychotic episode. Great. Now Im also crazy. Did I already mention that I have depression? Yeah, and also another untreatable disorder called Misophonia which makes me hyper-sensitive to sounds and makes my life a living hell. Ive already tried killing myself in March. 

I know that everyone is going to say that I should get immediate help. I know that I should be in the hospital right now. But if I go in the hospital right now, I would destroy my whole life for the next 9 months. And Im not sure how I would survive that. I dont even know what the hospital is going to do for me. They are probably going to label this depressive episode as a psychotic one again and are going to lock me up and put me under medication that is going to MURDER MY THOUGHTS. I would rather be dead that let that happen again. And even if they label it as a depressive episode, I know how the hospital works. There is a good chance that I am going to get released after 2 weeks and then have to wait MONTHS to get stationary treatment. I didnt even mention how every professional I have talked to has no clue on what to do. My complications are so interwoven and complex that not a single out of the probably 10 professionals already has any clue on what to do.

We havent even talked about what happens if I go to the hospital. I would ruin my path of study, I would have literally NOTHING to do for 9 months. Not only that, I would also be 100% isolated from any social contact in these 9 months. I would lose THE ONLY POTENTIAL FRIEND AND PARTNER I CAN TALK TO and I would be torn out of society for all that time. 

I am just really tired of everything. I am tired of living. I tried 3 different meds. Ive tried every possible hobby, Ive tried fixing my nutrition, I tried physical activity. Ive talked to tons of professionals. I am just tired. I would rather stop living at all. There is no hope. Whatever I do, there is no way for me to recover.

I am an academical failure. And there is nothing in my power to change that. I am a social failure. And there is nothing in my power to change that. I am so fake in interactions that I have never had *real impact* on any human being on earth. I am nothing. I represent nothing. There is no unique human value behind me. I am just wasted potential. I am worthless. If I would die the only people that would cry are my degenerate parents. 

I want to fucking die.

"My friends all yelled Happy New Year.ù But I dont feel that way... Hi, Im new to reddit, but last night I had another episode and decided that I just really needed a place to speak my mind.

Im in my early twenties, I just graduated college. All my life I have struggled through obstacles. 

I was diagnosed with Sensory Processing Disorder(Im autistic), Borderline Personality Disorder, OCD, and severe depression and anxiety at an early age.  Ive been to 11 funerals in my young life, one of them being my best friend.  I always wonder if Ill be the cause of the 12th. Ive been suicidal for a long time, I have a history of addiction that I have been battling since high school. Rn Ive been sober from drugs for almost a year but I have a cigarette addiction now and I abuse alcohol. Ive been in mentally abusive relationships that left me broken and I havent had a girlfriend in 4 years.

Just in the last month and a half Ive been ghosted by 10 different females that I had started hanging out with and getting intimate with.  I am a straight forward person. I dont play games and Im a gentleman. I dont make moves on a girl the first time I hang with her to make sure she feels comfortable and can build trust between us. These girls would all seem normal but then start to send such cryptic messages and play games and then just disappear. Most recently a girl I graduated with started spending a lot of time with me. I would visit her at the bar she bartends at and she would drop everything to come talk with me and get me free drinks. Then she faked on my New Years Eve party on Monday and I havent heard from her since. Looks like another L for me. What am I doing wrong? It just takes my already low confidence even lower. The girls that are interested in me are attractive, my friends classify them all as like 6-7 out of 10 and up. Im athletic, Im a jockù I guess. but when I look in the mirror, I see flaws and imperfections. I hate myself and I do my best to keep my pain to myself and cope on my own, because I dont want to sound pessimistic and turn people away from me. I want to be the positive person that people love to be around but its so hard when Im so depressed. 

Im just so lost rn and dont know what my future holds. Ive accepted that I will always have to battle obstacles from mental disorders, but I just want one good thing to happen to me in the new year. After 23 years of struggling, I just wanna get one good moment for once...",Depression

And I did live pretty good for a couple of years. 
Then I was stricken with a chronic autoimmune illness. I tried to push through as best I could, but eventually I had to stop working and my social life crashed along with it.
Now... every day is a struggle. My social life is non-existent. I havent been dating, I havent taken a photo in a long time. Photography was my salvation for a long time. Now I feel like I have no creativity left in me. 
Now Im noticing some cognitive issues. 
When I read something, I have to read it over and over to comprehend it. 
When I look at a scene on the tv I have to blink and concentrate really hard to understand what Im seeing. 
Ive always been smartù top of my classes, totally fierce in my former career and now I feel like Im losing the only edge Ive ever had.
This, to me, is more disturbing than my suicidal ideation. 
Anyone else experience this?
Any advice?

"I'm so tired of hurting TW: cheating, suicide



I \[28F\] just found messages on my boyfriends phone \[27M\] where he's been sexting other women. When he was visiting family out of state last week and 18 hours ago. This the 3rd, 4th time I've found them? I've lost count. He said I could trust him, he said he wasn't doing it anymore. I feel so stupid for believing him. He said, but I didn't cheat, I just messaged them, like that makes any difference. He said I asked for it, that he obviously hasn't been happy. He hit me again, going to have to wear long sleeves to cover up the bruise again.



I feel so, so alone. My best friend moved out of state, I have no relationship with my family. The only person that loves me obviously doesn't because he's constantly trying to cheat on me. I'm so tired of hurting. I take my pills, I try to breathe, I try to get out of bed and make progress. I'm so tired of trying and failing. I want to give up, life is pain and hurt.

"Thoughts on being depressed and unemployed yet still keeping strong - To myself and all of you lovely people going through the same shit Its hard to land on a decent job with depression and anxiety, then being unemployed (= no income) just make you more depressed and desperate...Ive been in this vicious cycle for a long time, its just so difficult to get out of it and it really gets addictive.

Id advice to work with one problem at a time. I say, first thing first, we have to be mentally strong and healthy to get the rest of the boxes checked. Try to think positively, dig deep into your mind, find something you love to do and try to do it often (whether its exercise, painting, cooking, learning a new language, anything). Its okay to fall out of the new routineù at the beginning, remember anything youre doing is progress. 

Really, just start somewhere, youll find something more along the way. Try not to dwell on the past or feel bad about the present you because its not the person who you really are, youre way much better than that, you have to keep that in mind. 

One more thing, if you dont feel well physically, go see a doctor, dont delay. Normally we wont see a doctor when we got a flu because we have a healthy immune system. But when were depressed, our immune system weakens due to the inevitably poor diet and sleeping pattern, as a result, it wont work well to fight bad viruses in our body.

I have nobody to talk to, I dont have a good relationship with my family, and I cant help but want to die. I know I fucked up, I feel worthless and they wont accept any of my apologies. They have told so many people at my college about this and have turned everyone, even mere acquaintances, against me. Everyone thinks Im a lying slut. I tried to continue on and go to work today but I had to leave because I couldnt stop crying. Ive been throwing up from stress and cant keep food down. I have felt suicidal for several days now and I wish I could just go back in time. I dont know where else to turn, I just feel so alone. Im in a pit of despair and I cant get out of it. ",Depression

"I don't have any reason not to be happy and still I am not... Hey guys, 

I wish you all a better year in 2019. This post may seem really messy but I can't understand the cause of what I am going through. Last 3-4 years have also been pretty rough, however I blamed the huge amount of studying for university for being angry and sad so often. Lately I have finally realized that things are bad since I don't have any real reason to be so unsatisfied with my life. I have loving parents, far from perfect, but very supporting ones, I have extremely good grades and professional achievements. Sometimes I wish I would have a relationship, right now I am truly in love with the man of my dreams (I am bisexual, closeted), but not sure if he feels the same and soon he will leave with an internship to another country for a year, so I don't think this is going to work, which could contribute a little to my depression.



However, I cry myself to sleep more and more often. Sometimes I have suicidal thoughts, but I just don't know why. I could never do something like this to my family... I think most of these bad feelings may be triggered by my perfectionism - whenever I do something wrong I am really harsh on myself. I hate disappointing people and I feel like an utter failure when doing so... I know it's an extremely toxic mentality but it's really hard for me to control it. I am also a true workaholic and I experience mood swings. The worst part is that I find myself being hard on my family and friends without being able to control myself, and then I deeply regret everything I tell them that might have hurt them, which only makes everything worse. Maybe you can tell me what could be wrong with me. Advice is extremely appreciated.",Depression

"I have no one. What do I do? I have no connection in my life, and I have no idea what to do. 

It has been years since I have talked to my family. I haven't made any new friends since high school(9 years ago), and have recently lost the few which remained. I had one girlfriend in high school and have not otherwise dated. I have felt lonely and depressed since I was 13, but for the first time in my life I am now truly alone. No connections. No love. No intimacy.

From roughly age 17-22 I was addicted to drugs and alcohol, and used them daily for a period of at least 2 years. I am now 26 and have been mostly sober since this period of time. This has given me tremendous mental clarity, but had little effect on my overall depression. Therapy has had virtually the same effect, as have improving diet and exercise.

It feels like my heart has been scooped out and replaced with a brick. My mind is exhausted by voices which tell me that I will never be loved. I don't think I can say I've ever had deep connection with another person, and achieving this seems more and more difficult as time passes.

I am lost as to how I can find companionship in life. I am still young, but based on my trajectory, I don't think I have long before I give in, and give up. Anyone else pull themselves out of a similar situation?",Depression
"F [26] Feeling massively stuck. Which therapy to engage ? Tired of feeling like a huge victim all the time Hello there,

I'm writing this post maybe not so much to get some advice, but to feel overall less lonely in my problems or maybe to get some insights from you guys who had maybe overcome some similar problems. And also to get of my chest some stuff. As I'm not a native speaker, please disregard the few grammatical and spelling mistakes I made.

I recently completed my 26th birthday, and I have never been so anxious about my life and feeling that I can't sens no identity of myself.

I genuinely feel that I'm a somewhat talented and intelligent person, who in some certain aspects has charisma and gets easily new friends, but this year has been such a rollercoaster that I feel I lost all faith, in life and myself as well.

Here's a short summary of my life to try to explain to you how come I'm right now 26, moved back at my parents, unemployed and feeling completely stuck.

My parents working in the diplomatic field, I have endured several movings in Europe from the moment I had 9 months old, never living more than 4 years in the same place, and basically getting into a new school every year.

For whatever reason I was always very attached to the city where I was born, even though I never lived there more than 3 years in a row, it was always heartbreaking to being obliged into leaving to yet another country.

As a child at school I always felt like not belonging, either because I was the foreign kid with a weird name, either because I was the kid who lived abroad who speaks a little bit weird here mothertongue.

I was often made fun of my looks (I was curly haired with broken teeth and glasses and a big nose), and I was also being hardcore bullied for over a year when I was 12, which made me into cutting myself, even though that stopped about when I was 15 years old.

The year when I was into that super bullying environment, I also had a huge fight with my older brother, who has a somewhat weird autistic personality, and we still don't spoke to each other since. This story caused a huge sting in my heart, and the fact that my parents are enabling this situation makes me hate them and for that hate myself as well.

Also during these early teenage years, I started experimenting with all sorts of drugs, synthetic ones and psychedelic ones as well, which made my fucked up psychologic world even more fucked up and scary. Right now I'm the occasional party consumer but it doesn't make me happy that much for obvious reasons, and I also have a tendency to overindulge in alcohol and behave in a way I regret the morning after.

Confidence wise I'm a mess, I have social anxieties since that year when I was bullied, I tend to avoid certain social situations when I know I will be embarrassed and in a state where I start to hate myself for being shy and insecure.

This disturbs me mostly in my romantic relationships, which makes me feel very unnatural and embarrassed past the first couple of weeks when I'm high on love and hormones. Boys tend to get very attracted to me in the beginning, but the moment I start to develop attachement and feelings for them, I start to show my insecure side which makes them runaway as fast as they can.

So to put it in a sentence the current situation and where I need your help : this year, after having got my diploma at a prestigious university abroad, I started this summer another master's degree in a field that didn't really interested me in yet another country. I think I chose to runaway at this new university because I was afraid of the responsibilities that comes when you finish uni, finding a job you like and all that stuff.

During this exact time I was also developing a new relationship with a very disturbed drug addict person, who I knew was a bad idea but I was needing so much love that I chose to ignore the red flags.

So, in November I decide to stop this university which didn't make me happy, and move back to home once and for good to start a more stable and less lonely life. Eventually, I moved back home, and troubled boyfriend dumped my ass as soon as he could by saying he doesn't love me and that I'm stupid because of the decision I made.

I'm since searching a job and want to move out of my parents, but I have lost all my confidence and don't know where to begin, where to apply, I'm afraid of making a terrible mistakes, I'm afraid of committing into something that I don't like and to get into a situation that will make me unhappy and lead a horrible and dull life. I also feel that because I have grown up in 6 different countries I don't really belong here neither, and I'm very envious of all my friends who grew up in a stable environnement. I feel like I can't get anything right because of my education which made me a people pleaser, someone who isn't able to express its feelings and how to say no, and someone who is generally afraid of getting hurt by others. I had a few problems these past years which I'm ashamed of, that originated mostly from the fear of saying no and not knowing how to stand my ground.

**Do you think I have issues and I should go to therapy ? do you know a bomb therapy for self confidence and acceptance of the things that happened to us ?**

**or I'm just living the quarter life crisis everyone gets and I should shut up and take to first job that comes and eventually life will happen and everything will work out?**

"A little story about my life The format is gonna be a little weird.

So lets start by saying this: i can divide my life in 4 (i dont know how to call themm.. But lets say 4 parts).

First part is age 0-6 (i dont remrmber anything)

Second part is age 6-13

I have very few memories of this part of my life, few flashes but it's all a blur. What i can remember is that my fayher was physically and verbally abusive to my mom, brother, people in general.
Something i remember is we were somewhere in the woods (me, my father, my brother, my uncle). Something something happened, my dad got mad, took a branch from the tree and started beating the shit out of my brother.
In this part of my life i.. Well i was crying a lot and i dont think i was a good kid... I didnt eat much and that raised a lot of screaming, beatings and other.
Earliest memory of me wanting to die was in this part of my life, cant tell the age but i was in the kitchen holding a knife to my throat and thinking ""this would make such a mess.. Should i do it? Will it hurt? Will i survive? Whos gonna find me? Are people gonna scream at me?""
Around this time i stopped crying and screaming when there was a beating or argument or yells and i started having it inside my head (a constant"" thing"" where i would feel like screaming). If you're still reading i dont think you would be surprised to hear that i didnt have much social interaction or friends at all. I never had a friend or someone to really trust. Constant rejection from left and right.
Around this age i had a very energic behaviour that now looking back to it im not really a fan of and i pissed a lot of people but i cant apologise to everyone so i cant reallly do anything about it.

Third part of my life is age 13-16

At this point i was just getting more and more asocial and not wanting to interact with anyone. I locked myself and would just play videogames all day or watch stuff on youtube, animes, movies, series, reading stuff. I always wanted and wondered how it would be to do all this stuff all other kids do like going to parties or just like talking and stuff.
Nothing much happened this time since again, i dont remember much stuff at all but it was pretty much just wasting time and getting sadder by the day and slowly started to hate myself.

The fourth part of my life is age 16-now

This time is when i slowly started to develop ""me"", actively trying to work on myself, look at other people how they act and to just find something i enjoy to be. Something i didnt mention is that i daydream from a young age, i would stay hours and hours inside the stories i made inside my head (yes, i'm aware i have a pretty sad existence). This is also the time where i started to find things on my own (i was never pushed to study, or pursue anything or have a hobby or do fun things.... I think it was expected from mr to find that on my own?) now i'm here not knowing how to life at all. This is also the time where i found out about depression, self harm, suicide, trauma and other things. I finished highschool few months ago, didnt go to college because i failed my exams. Didnt expect at all to make it this far but that's mainly because i couldnt make up my mind to end it. It's very hard for me to understand other people or understand their feelings,i hate myself for not being able to love or have personal talks or be there for someone because i dont know how. I feel extremely uncomfortable sharing stuff or someone sharing stuff to me. I think i am asexual since i didnt really felt any attraction to anyone,i view that as a plus tho because i'm no by any means capable of loving or caring for someone and i dont think someone should waste their time on me.
When i started selfharming i didnt start small.. I went all out on it and now the damages has allready been done. No more tshirts, just long sleeves. I weight around 45kg, lost a lot of weight due to not eating, having no apetite at all. All my life i saw people around me getting help, if they suffered they got understood and got help but not me. As a kid everytime i would get dismissed. If i would to open up to someone or seek help i would get dismissed again. I honestly hope with all heart 2019 will be easier to me to make my decision and leave in peace. Theres also the possibility of life changing for the better but lets be real, thats unlikely to happen. I dont want to fight, i dont have the power to get better. I felt rejection, got made fun of for way too long and too much to be fixed.

If you've rrsd through this i would like to say thank you, thats a small summary of my lovely journey. I hope you have a nice day/night :^) ",Depression
"Hopefully This Will Work I have been up and down with depression. I felt like I was doing okay and, you know the drill, sudden wave pulls me under. As a teacher I have two (much needed) weeks for winter break. However, the breaks are usually the worst part for me (I posted about that over the summer) because I'm just so alone. I've been reading a book called *You Are a Badass*, and one of the things that stuck with me was gratitude. I mean, once you can find a silver lining in your dad's suicide, you can find the positive in anything, right?

So, anyway, I stumbled across an acquaintance's post on Instagram which showed a chart she'd made for tracking daily habits. I immediately thought of some of the basic things I have trouble keeping up with due to depression. Even when I'm feeling good, I still have trouble doing these things regularly because I'm just not in the habit of it.  
I mean basic things like brushing my teeth, showering, and taking my meds. I added in a couple others like meditation (something I'd like to try) and finding one thing to be grateful about each day.

This is only the second day I've tracked it, but it gives me such a feeling of accomplishment to color in the box. I'm hoping that taking basic care of myself and practicing gratitude, in addition to meds and talk therapy, can help me stay on track and maybe a bit more balanced.",Depression

"I'm out of options Not sure why I'm making this post (maybe looking for some hope, though I'm doubtful). I'm 21 but my life really feels like it's over. I've tried it all: more medications than I can even remember, talk therapy, exercise, experimental treatments, TMS. But I'm increasingly depressed. My life just feels grey. It's like I'm sitting in a waiting room, just waiting until the day I die. My life is pretty objectively miserable, too. I have no friends because I destroyed all my relationships because of my anger and insecurity. I've done terribly in college, which has destroyed my dreams of getting a PhD. This is maybe due to my depression, but more likely due to the fact I'm a terrible, lazy person. I genuinely feel like my life has nothing left to offer me. All my therapists seem to have pretty much given up. At this point I just sit there for the hour in silence. I genuinely feel as though there's some cosmic force actively working to make me miserable as nothing seems to go my way. But I know it's mostly me. Even drugs don't lift my mood (not that I was ever a heavy drug user but I've tried them). My parents are so tired of my sadness that they're just angry at me and claim I love misery. Trust me, I don't. I honestly feel as though I'm so close to just ending it all. I care about my family still and won't do it while I'm home. But I'm so miserable that not even the thought of their sadness at my death outweighs the pain of being. But there's a beam in my bedroom at college and I fantasize about hanging myself. I'm actually kind of confident I'll do it the day I get back. I'm just tired of hating everything and being hopeless. I've browsed the posts on here and it really feels like nobody quite feels the way I do. I've got a tiny amount of hope left but I feel like it's futile.

But then i pushed myself for some ?Æ?ˇself care?ˇ?Ø me time and it was a bit of an effort but I did it, had a face mask, did my nails. And after i felt a bit better, not top form yet but still better. So i continued on a roll by doing what i was longing to do: paint my bedroom cupboards. Felt good to get it done. Even if i didnt do any ?Æ?ˇwork?ˇ?Ø per say (still have homework to finish) i still did things that felt rewarding and i think i might go to bed a bit earlier tonight. Been to bed super late the past couple days since i came home to my mother. Complicated family situation badically: mom:drunk. Dad:living his best life. So when i come home from a lovely trip with dad its such a depressing change.
Also my teacher told us once (on a difficult hiking trip) that its the same advice for hiking and people with depression: to just keep going. And Id be lying if I said I didnt reflect on that and it does keep me going sometimes. 

So yeah from my experience just doing things to maintain a basic way of living is already an exploit you should be proud of and feel good about, its a sign you havent given up. Dont get me wrong, staying in bed all day is also completely okay, Im just ranting about my day on here cuz i have nowhere to note down these small positive experiences.

"LF advice - recurring low-level depression Hi,

first of all - heads up to everyone suffering here. The ""shit"" I had to go through was kinda nothing to the stuff I read here... and still, that experience knocked me out for a while. So I can barely feel what some of you guys felt. Please keep in mind that there are options, people and institutions you can talk to 24/7.



My problem (long post, sorry):

On days like these, I am kinda afraid to stumble back into a depressive phase. My life is actually not bad at all... got a job, I am healthy (besides my nerdy back pain), I do sports, got a job, some hobbies, a few friends. Trying to be thankful for that.

But on days like today, Idk how to deal with it (even though I know the answer ... and here I need some experience from you guys): made the plan yesterday to go to the gym today (have off for the rest of the week). Woke up around 10 am, read a while in bed, got up, breakfast, played video games, cleaned the bathroom, tried to get sth going. ""Couldn't"" get outside for stupid reasons (like it's too cold or whatever, clearly lying to myself). Catch myself looking outside, knowing I just have to step outside and having fun while taking a walk, riding my bike or do whatever I wanna do... I have everything I need. Except for the motivation. Could have done ""escape room"" with a friend (she asked), but I didn't feel like it even though I was aware that it had been better for my mood. I just didn't go outside all day. Was stuck at home. Bored by everything I could do there. Tried to pass time... ending up with backpain again (besides me sitting in front of the pc, I am pretty sure it's a lot from my mental state).

To fight my depression, I changed a lot; eating habits, doing sports again, looking for hobbies, forcing myself out into nature when I felt that it became worse again - I fought. And I feel like I won the big battles. But I am always aware that there is something inside of me, like the scared part of myself, that questions everything, sometimes (luckily rarely by now) stuns me and stops me from doing shit. I also felt like the part of me I am aware of has become the grown-up, taking the hand of the scared kid-part and by this I kinda got the upper hand. But today that didn't do it (for the first time in a while).

Of course there are days when you just don't feel like doing this or that. But experiencing situations like ""I could do this and that and this would be fun"" and then just not doing it ""because"" .... for no real reason. 

And this is the point where I ask for your input: if you know those situations, how do you deal with it? I am trying to find a new therapist (was not happy with the last one) and already got back to the gym, but motivation and energy for this are already fading (like after a month). ... How to deal with that shit when you know that the easiest way is just to do it and nobody but yourself keeps you from doing it??????

Happy for shared experiences.

Thanks. Be save. And have a good time.",Depression

"I washed the dishes today Ive come a long way from my depression that started briefly when I was about 15 years old and was at its worst point when I was 19/20. It resulted in a suicide attempt and an addiction. I spent my 20th birthday in an inpatient rehab. 

When I was almost 21 I relapsed and overdosed in my room which was a life-altering event for me. I began to turn my mental state around for the better and I was doing so fantastic. I found and developed hobbies that I lost over those years, met new people and I was so happy; I thought I beat it until recently. 

May I note that drug use will ever be an option in my life again but lately I have been feeling my depression creeping back up on me, I believe its partially due to allowing certain peoples negative comments and attitude towards me bring me down and thats something I think I need to change. 

Ive stopped doing the things that I had re-found that I had enjoyed and most of those things that I enjoy dont even require me leaving my apartment. I just dont want to do anything, everything seems so bland.

But today I went with my sister to the airport to see her off to Texas again for the next 5 months (shes military), I showered and I did the dishes.. a task I have been avoiding for over a week and its only 3:30 in the afternoon.

And I think Ill try cleaning my apartment today, or at least maybe just the bathroom. And tomorrow I think Ill do my laundry. 

I know it seems very minor but Im so happy for what I accomplished today, it gives me hope for myself and I just really wanted to share this with you guys. ",Depression

"I am an Asian Female Harvard Student and I want to beat the living hell out of white women all the time. I come from Houston Texas. Back then we used to have what we called strips. There was the Asian Strip, The Mexican Strip and the White strip. There were 5 major massage parlous that we always used to fight for control over.  I was on the Asian strip obviously. People always wanted to go and see the white girls so we had to work 3 times as hard as them to get our customers to come back and use absolutely filthy and nasty techniques like acting like we were desperate for are clients as soon as they walked through the door and asking how long its been since they've cum. We didn't like the Mexicans but the whites were much worse to us but whenever we saw a white woman get a customer we used to run up to their strip and beat the living hell out of them, I used to be called Jazzy Hootenanny, in houston. I was very well known for beaten the living hell out of these whites and showing off my muscles after, then taking their clients for a discounted massage. One day I saw a white woman on the asian strip telling a man saying ""Don't go there, she gives sad ending blowjob"" dancing with her ass out. I grabbed the cracker clean by her hair and dragged her across the street. I beat the living hell out of her and I was so proud. I just kept thinking to myself, ""asian power"" while showing off my muscles to her. That was the last time she came to the chinatown strip.

Now I'm in a totally different environment. Harvard university. Things go completely differently here, the whites work with the Asians and there is no competition between us, but the lifestyle of beating these white women is still in my system, whenever I see a white girl in Lowell house, I want to beat them to a pulp, show off my muscles and take their boyfriend in my room for a massage. I don't know if I can make it to 2022 without getting expelled for this. In chinatown we have this saying ""Once a massage girl, always a massage girl"", I have no regrets as I had to find a way to pay my tuition. The only thing that gets my mind off beating white women is when I think about my book deal about how hard it is being an Asian massage girl at Harvard University I hope to win a McArther Genius prize for it.

"Feel like Im slowly dying on the inside There was a girl that Ive dated for awhile, we werent officially a couple yet because we said we wanted it to be official when we finally meet face to face ( it was a LDR btw) Months passed by and I considered us as really close because I pretty much knew everything about her (eg:hobbies, favourite food etc) During December I told her that I needed some time alone because I really needed to prepare well for my finals and I promised her that Ill give her all the attention she wants once the finals was over. She did give me some personal space, not a lot but it was enough I guess. 

Now after the finals I did give her attention but during this time, my family and I had some arguments and it was then when I only realised that my mom actually prefers my brother over me. You know how you ask your parents whos your favourite child and they would always say that they love each and everyone of us equally and that they have no favourites, well my mom definitely didnt say that who was her favourite child otherwise that would make her the worst mom on the planet, but finding out on your own was definitely heart wrenching. I found out on Christmas btw so I was having a really crappy day, I cried all alone in my room feeling like trash. I actually felt something had painfully  died in me. I was depressed for days.

Back to the girl I was dating, I felt really depressed those few days so I didnt really text her as much as usual and I guess she started to lose interest in me. Days later I saw pictures of her FaceTiming another guy because she posted it on her Facebook story, there were even shirtless pictures of the guy which I dont even know how she got it. So I asked her if she was seeing another person and she replied to me saying does it really matter?ù  And then she said hes (the shirtless guy) not mine yet, but who knowsù. As soon as I saw that text my heart started crying and I just tell her that I hope you will be happy in the futureù and left. So I fell to the floor and started crying like a baby again...

They are happy, yet without me. 

It's egoistic, but I genuinely afraid of being left, and this felt like... Abandonment?

My family were sleeping, I grabbed the only sharp thing I found - I gave all my blades to my friend recently, and it was huge mistake - it was a usual knife and tried to slit my veins. It wasn't sharp enough to leave something more than scratch. I cried my eyes out while trying to cut deep enough but it didn't even bleed that much. It almost wasn't bleeding, tbh. 

You may say it isn't even attempt, I had no chance to hurt myself bad enough to be in danger. But I feel it was. I wasn't THIS close for a while. If knife was sharp enough or if I had my blade, I'd did the thing right.

"Any advice appreciated, so desperate.. Dear reddit-community,

I've been reading the posts here for a while now because knowing that other people on this planet are feeling similar is a big help for me (none of my rl friends can relate to feel like I do but i know some of you can).

I want to give you a bit of a background first: I first got depressed 4 years ago after I promoted from high school. Since then my life quality is constantly declining. I've visited plenty of psychiatrists and even went to the psychiatric clinic in May 2018. I've been trying a lot of different antidepressants over the years and none of them really helped me. After the first year of my depression I started smoking weed and doing even ""harder"" drugs like MDMA (mever mixed with ADs), cocaine, amphetamine, 2CB and a few more. In the beginning I thought it can cure my depression, especially smoking weed regularly. As it was to expect I was totally wrong. The weed began to trigger strong anxiety attacks and the ""harder"" drugs made me feel sick for 4 weeks because I've overdone them. I stopped taking drugs 1.5 years ago and never touched anything since then but the depression got way worse. I went back on ADs but it did not help at all. As it was getting worse and worse I went to the clinic with no success either. After I was released from the clinic I stopped my medication and it got slightly better. 

Some more points about my person: male, 24 years old, living in Switzerland (I hope my English is good enough for you to understand me), been diagnosed with ADHD, generalized anxiety and depression.

So that you know my story to some extent I want to tell you about the problem I am having now:

Recently I started to lose my energy because my sleep isnt restorative anymore (I can go to bed whenever I want and sleep for 6, 8, 10,12 hours or even longer and I feel like I have 10% of my normal energy. I was never the kind of person who slept all day and for me this change is 100%. When I wake up I have strong headache as well. I try to drink coffee and redbull but it doesnt do anything. I can do whatever I want and I am still so extremely tired. I cant do ANYTHING right now and its getting worse and worse every day. I feel like my soul dies if this continues like that.

From what Ive read I want to test some things before getting on an AD again (even if i wont help I guess) :

Sleep apnea, gluten intolerance (celiac desease), bruxismus (cause my teeth hurt every time I wake up, vitamins, iron levels, thyroid. If nothing from this list is causing this inhuman tiredness I expect it to be the depression itself (or my wrecked psyche..). 

I am really desperate right now because dealing with depression and having ZERO energy for nothing is so fucking hard and life does not make any sense like that. I am so afraid that I will never be able to deal with a normal life again.. 

If you have any suggestions (ADs that helped you, opinions regarding the tests I want to do, more causes that I should check, stories of your similar situation or anything else that is related to this) please write a comment. I appreciate every single help and I am so thankful for you reading my post. 

Many thanks in advance guys, your the only ones who maybe understand my situation and how I feel.

"Trying to cope with crushing disappointment Im 11 years into a career as a creative director, which sounds cool but has proven to be less creative of a career path than I hoped for, and is instead a very stressful management oriented job with little satisfaction.

"Gf has depression along with other mental issues. How can I coax her to do things without being pushy or mean? We're talking things that NEED to happen every day.

"I have friends. I've been in relationships. I come from a good supportive family. And I am totally, utterly alone. I'm 31 years old.  I've lived all across the country .

"Am I depressed? I am just so angry. I feel like it's so unfair that all of my friends get to graduate college and have happy, healthy relationships, while I'm 23, in my SECOND year at college, and too mentally ill (OCD) to find a relationship. And the verbal/emotional abuse I experienced from my dad when I was a kid did not help at all and wrecked my self-esteem.

After I graduated high school at 18, I fell mentally ill. Because of this, and that I changed majors several times, I spent four years fulfilling the requirements for my associate's degree.

When I got accepted to my university, I learned from them that my major (mechanical engineering) doesn't even require hardly any general ed classes. So, goodbye to four years of my life. I have to start the four years for their engineering program almost from scratch.

I also have failed several courses there, setting me back another 1-2 semesters. I was originally going to be able to plan to graduate in Spring of 2021, but I don't know if it's going to happen by then. Hell, I don't even know if it will happen AT ALL, because I always get set back by some stupid thing in life.

I'm not lazy; in fact, there was a brief period in my life (Summer of 2015) where I was free from my OCD. I achieved this by working 45+ hours per week doing manual labor at a hand car wash. Work is the only thing that makes me feel fulfilled. School makes me feel like I am not productive and it completely drags me down, creating a gaping void in my life, combined with the guilt of being a 23-year-old who is still dependent on his parents.

Sometimes it gets so bad that the very existence of women with STEM degrees makes me feel worthless and emasculated. Pregnant women make me feel emasculated (even though I don't want kids). They're just a painful reminder that no woman is ever going to want to carry my child or feel that I am a worthy partner for it. I know that this is racist, but I feel the same about Asian women [30+] in my area, because so many first-generation Asian women tend to date Asian men who are successful and make &gt;$100,000 per year. NONE of them will date a white, career-less loser like me who doesn't have his shit together yet.

I know this is cheesy, but I saw the new Cinderella movie on Netflix recently, and it made me really yearn to have a loving, fulfilling relationship like that. I can only hope that that is what my future holds.

To top it all off, I developed dysphagia about two years ago. The doctors have been too stupid to figure out what's causing it, so I dealt with the problem by making myself fruit smoothies, which are easier to swallow. Unfortunately, those are expensive, so I turned a $6,300 savings into a $1,300 credit card debt over 18 months. It turned into an eating disorder, where I would spend upwards of 6 hours per day shopping, making, or trying to eat, food. It left me with no time to read, play guitar, or do anything else fun. I remember I got to see Cannibal Corpse a year ago in concert. **Even after I had bought my ticket, and even after the concert had started, I was STILL deliberating about whether or not I wanted to go.**

I suspect that my dad has some sort of autism/Asperger's, and I have zero sympathy for him. He would always bully and criticize me as a kid, all the while bragging to his friends about how awesome I am. He hates himself, and used me as a vessel to build his self-esteem. It made me extremely sensitive to anything he said to me. And I'll bet you can imagine how it made me feel when he constantly fear-mongered to me about how my college fund might run out and how I will have to take out a loan, or that I will need to pay for my own health insurance once I turn 26 (as per the Affordable Care Act). Of course, this is possible, I'm not trying to cop-out or say that I shouldn't do this, but all of these problems make me not want to continue. Success does not await me, it will simply be indefinitely pushed back.

EVERYTHING gives me anxiety now. I never wake up eager to start my day. I always wonder how long it's going to take me to start being productive in a day, or how badly I will fail. Because sunsets are so beautiful where I live, they give me existential anxiety. Like a sunset, life is very beautiful but very short, and if I am not living it to the fullest, 100% of the time, I am wasting it and it is such a horrible thing.

I don't have the will to kill myself. I am too invested in the arbitrary possibility of finding love and reaching a point in my life (when I'm not in school) when I can work full-time. But at this point? I don't want to continue. **I hope my school burns to the ground.** It is a bastion of failure that has destroyed me and brought my mental illness back.",Depression

"A fictional character has ruined me (re-post from r/mentalhealth) I've been suffering from depression for a long time now for reasons people may consider to be very ""serious"". Serious they were indeed, so serious in fact that they were fixable only by me, not a therapist. I've never once considered visiting a therapist before until very recently when a rather new but ""embarrassing"" issue arose. This newly found issue combined with the ones I already suffered from have left me at a point in life where suicide seems ever so appealing.

I won't talk about the issues that I was already suffering from because that's not were I need a therapist's help. The solution to them are well beyond a therapists power. This however is different and, I'll once again say, embarrassing.

Even with the anonymity of the internet, I feel embarrassed to say this, but I beg you all to take it seriously.

A fictional character has destroyed me as a person. Initially it seemed like a case of sexual attraction and to an extent it still is. I've always have had a very diverse and weird sexual preference, I won't mention what that entails but homosexuality wasn't one of them. Well, until this anomaly struck me.

The part were it gets bad however is that I realized I might be far more than just ""in love"". I now have an inferiority complex when before I could be considered borderline narcissistic. I loved my looks, my personality etc until this character shattered all of that.

Their looks, personality, intelligence etc makes me feel like dirt. I revere that character like perfection, like a god incarnate. Now, I'm aware fictional characters are always presented as beyond the average human. Indeed, I always acknowledged that whenever I perceived a character I found very infatuating, but here I simply can't help myself. This is the first time ever a fictional character had such an effect on me.

I always looked at people who are infatuated with anime characters and ""waifus"" with absolute ridicule. Yet here I am, more fanatical about it than anyone else.

I don't think I can quite describe with words how awful it feels. But the pain now goes beyond my mind and is having physical effects. I feel filled with something, every night I sometimes struggle to breathe because it feels like something is clogging up my body inside. This feeling occurs whenever I fantasize about him with that same soundtrack of his playing in my head on loop. I feel insane.

I can no longer appreciate myself, not only do I want to meet him, have sex with him (I can't even masturbate to anything else now) but I also want to BE him. But he's not real, which leaves me with a sense of extreme longing. Imitating him is never enough.

I just want to go home so I can deal with the incident back home, but its eating away at me. Its killing me thinking about what happened and how I wasnt there when I should have been. Anyways, I need a way to get through these four days. I cant leave where I am, I cant drive because the roads are too bad and I dont have a car, and theres not much to do while Im here. I have sleeping pills that I keep taking over and over again, but theyre making me feel sick. I was able to sleep for about a day and a half straight, but I cant keep this up. Can anyone help me? Can someone give me some advice? Im so lost and alone right now. I wish I could just skip these next 4 days",Depression
"Concerned about depressed little sister Hey all. This post isn't actually about me, it's about my little sister. She's 17 and has history of suicide attempts/therapy/etc. all the way back to 12 years old. She's been hospitalized 4 times for suicide attempts, however the last one was in 2014 so I thought she was doing better. For reference, she is diagnosed with bipolar disorder and isn't currently in school or work. I've noticed she has a lot of symptoms of depression (lack of hygiene, sleeping a lot, etc.) She says she hasn't had any friends since middle school. She is home most of the time unless our dad forces her to go out.



Speaking of our parents, I honestly don't even know if they give a shit about her, as blunt as that is. My mom was never around my little sister that much and she was mostly taken care of by our grandma who drank a lot. Our dad is actually our stepdad, and my sister doesn't really let him get close to her. They used to take her to therapy and try to help, but only if other people were around to witness it, if you get what I mean. They didn't seem to care about trying to help her get better unless there was someone around to flatter them for it, like family friends, or her teachers etc. Now that she's out of school, they couldn't care less about her it seems. 



My sister only really talks to me, and she's made a lot of death related 'jokes' lately. For example, if our dad asks her to wash the dishes, she mumbles ""can't wash them if I'm dead"" to herself, knowing I can hear it, and laughs. It seems like a cry for help but I don't know what I can do, since she's built walls up around herself emotionally. I've offered to discuss things with her but she just says she's fine and walks out. She has good days sometimes, where she'll get up and do full self-care routines and clean her room and the entire house and try to hang out with me all day and have fun, I'm assuming maybe it's mania on those days? She seems to have very rapid highs and lows - rapid as in anywhere from every few days to daily. 



I guess what finally pushed me to making this post is the fact that I found a suicide note in her room one day when I was looking for headphones I let her borrow. I'm terrified of losing my little sister but I've never been depressed/suicidal, I've never known anyone who was that I was aware of, and I have no idea how to help. She has shut everyone out emotionally it seems. I'm scared I'll come home from work one day and find her dead or dying. Sorry for the 'life story' here, but I haven't felt it right to tell my parents this, as they'd probably just punish her for it, so there's a lot to get off my chest. Anything is appreciated, thanks",Depression

"2nd day of 2019 You see, we tend to look forward for having a REGENERATED, MORE POSITIVE new year but hey, because of this black dog that keeps on following me, I develop an acceptance and recognition that I will never be able to bring back the smile on my face. I am getting used of having this bitchface. No, I do not want to smile Susan. Actually, wrong. I cannot smile. I just can't. My face is like a cemented wall. No mark of crumpled skin around my eyes. Lips are getting dry. 

I am extremely sad and abandoned and ashamed.

Look, I am trying to be ok. But sometimes I just want to surrender to the idea that I am like this - a lonely girl - and will never be able to find happiness again. Believe me if I say that I really want to feel high as well. I have never created a magnificent dream like to be a doctor, or be a lawyer or be something. I just want to be happy.

"Where can I seek free to minimal cost help with depression in the Bay Area, CA? Someone to talk to? When I start to succumb to my insecurities and problems I feel like I'm uncovering a hole that's always been there. I start having these nagging negative thoughts where it seems like everything is against me. I'm constantly reassuring myself that if I keep working hard things will get better, I have to otherwise I fall down the hole and convince myself that it's hopeless. Sometimes it's so intense it gives me anxiety and my heart starts beating really fast and I have racing thoughts. I don't think I developed socially, which is why I don't have many friends, I don't have any except one. I feel lonely. I downloaded tinder, then uninstalled it. I had these very paranoid thoughts about this Washington Post article I read on how to properly uninstall tinder and cancel your subscription. It felt like they were trying to push away undesirables away from the platform. Like, the only reason you have to uninstall Tinder is because you've found someone, and any other reason besides that makes you a loser and you shouldn't be using the service so here's how to properly cancel it to ensure you don't come back.

I put on 40 pounds, which I have now lost but always seem to be unsatisfied with. I know that objectively I'm doing a lot better, but this loneliness and social ineptitude gets to me sometimes. I hate that I can't develop relationships. Whenever someone interacts with me, I just force smile, force laugh and say ""Yeah"". I can never be myself, it's so hard. I have so many problems from my childhood that I just want to talk about, there's so much I want to unload. I have one friend I can talk to, but obviously I don't want to overwhelm them with all of my problems. We have conversations were I unload in bits, but I want to completely rant away.

"Is anyone else depressed because of work? I've had a particularly bad day today, largely due to my mum telling me how I'm wasting my life and that I'm a lazy piece of shit (in nicer words, but still), so of course I spent hours crying and wishing for death. I feel like I can't even write a coherent post, but it got so bad today that I just wanted to know if anyone feels the way I do.

I've been suffering from depression for over ten years, but ever since I entered the workforce, the sole cause of my depression has been the fact that I have to work. I genuinely don't have a life: only two friends, out of whom only one keeps in touch with me and that I see maybe twice a year, no love life (I am 26 and have never even held hands with anyone), no driver's licence due to a shit ton of fear of my own incompetence, social anxiety, generalised anxiety (it's never been diagnosed, but I essentially fear everything, such as going to the doctor's, talking on the phone or sometimes even leaving the house), severe acne and an ugly face and body due to a 44 lbs weight gain.

Now, even if I had a life, I am convinced that no amount of fun outside of work could balance out the imprisonment that work is to me. Don't get me wrong, it's not because of the particular job I have - I already have a really cushy job with very little responsibility and I live at home, so I don't have to work a lot (which is a good thing, since I couldn't bring myself to work a lot if I tried). So essentially I will forever be entrapped in this fucking prison called work with nothing to distract me from it, unless my pipe dream of winning the lottery comes true (I know, I know, but it's the only thing that gives me hope sometimes - of course I'm dumb enough to believe in the law of attraction, like the desperate fool I am). Does anyone else feel the same, that your depression is caused by the fact that we are essentially slaves for more than half of our waking hours?",Depression

I can feel the pain of the woman sitting next to me on the train hiding her tears. I can feel the pain of the earth as the garbage fills it's belly in the landfills.

Now Im not really sure why Im writing this, whether it be to vent, or relate to someone that felt like this also. I lost my job, cant drive, cant do much of anything because I feel so bad.

"I'm so alone and IT'S MY FAULT last night i called the police on my friend because he constantly talks about killing himself, and he doesn't listen to me anytime i say anything and try to help. he calls me a liar. granted, he hates me and kind of thinks i'm evil so. he lives in another state, and when the cops showed up, nothing even happened. but he's mad at me now (even though he said he wasn't last night) because I ""humiliated"" him in front of his parents. what the fuck was i supposed to do, i was pushed to the fucking edge. now he says he's never going to tell me anything anymore and that if i talk about self-harm, he's sending the cops to my house. if that happens, i don't know what i'd do. i want to be a cop one day so that obviously won't reflect well on me, and i know they won't be merciful if they show up.



i lost all my friends from high school. and he constantly reminds me of the fact and how he's the only one who hasn't left. it makes me feel shitty and makes me realize how incompetent i am. and now, because i called the cops, i completely ruined our relationship. i've felt like i'm losing it these past couple of days. i have spent every night crying constantly for HOURS, and he doesn't care. now he's forcing me to read off an apology he wrote where i basically admit that i am manipulative and abusive when none of that is even true. i am trying my fucking best. i used to suffer from some dissociative issues when i was younger, and now it's coming back because of the sheer stress i'm experiencing. i don't know what i did to deserve this, but maybe a lot. i don't want to feel anymore. i just want to be numb and disconnect from my body.

but i dont think im capable of all those emotions. my confidence in them is dulled by self doubt and confusion. i do feel something real in a few memories, if i really focus, but i dont know if i want to cling to that or not anymore.

something is wrong with me. i cant think straight enough to know what or what to do, but i still can tell. 

do i even want to get better? im too lazy for that, i just want someone to do all the work for me. and if no one does i dont really care, i could fall into this confusing daze so easily. till i die. 

itd be so fast.

heres a small PSA, *im not a good person.* so stop bringing down actual good people by grouping me with them

im so irresponsible to let people like me, let some love me. i dont deserve their love, and they deserve someone better to love. im so fucked its ridiculous. and edgy too, god. so stuck in my own head. 

im sick of lies. sympathy i dont deserve. i wasnt abused, i manipulated everyone to think i was a victim. being a child doesnt excuse anything. it was discipline, i was defiant. and im lazy and irresponsible, the only reason i try to be so positive to people is because i feel compelled to make up for something to do with my existence, some sin i cant quite put my finger on. but whats it matter anyways? all i do is act, controlling the output actions of the body im in to change the environment and influence other people to see things a certain way. to see me a certain way. its all so manipulative. i wish i could cut out the middle man and interact with people directly. its all so fake, and no matter how i put these words out, no matter how many time i repeat these long tangents of boring useless posts with minor changes, no matter how real i try to be, its all the same.

and i see how the world sees people like me. i know i shouldntù care, but i do. if the majority feels a certain way and im already not confident in my feelings, what reason do i not have to believe im in the wrong? im delusional enough as it is, theyre right. im a useless attention seeker. im denying biology, im confused, i belong in a mental asylum. they ought to hang tranny degenerates like me.

but its okay that they say that, i hate me too.

you know, i hate how edgy it is to say anything along the lines of ?i think im going insane, but im genuinely wondering thats where im headed. i have to focus to even be in reality. this just isnt right. nothing is.

so there i go, undoing so much of my hard work back from when i cared enough to try and get better in the blink of an eye. or, there i went. the bloods dried in my time writing this.

i havent cut since august. didnt realize how long itd been till now.

"30 years old and feeling like my life is over 2018 was a pretty bad year for me. My contract ended in December 2017 (the company I was working for basically told me I wasn't good enough to work there, even though they were hemorrhaging money and laying people off) and I was unemployed until I got a summer position with the provincial government, which I was hoping would turn into something more (as well as giving me access to internal postings) but didn't because a month into that the provincial government instituted a hiring freeze (and so much for the ~50 internal postings I applied for, all cancelled). The summer job was super demoralizing because they just stuck me in an office alone with nothing to do, and paid me minimum wage. I have a university education, and ~2.5 years experience in my field. 

I've been unemployed since August (my unemployment benefit has run out) and I'm losing my mind. I'm 0 for 3 for the interviews I've done since then. After the last one went so bad I had a panic attack and had a meltdown in-front of my parents. I'm out of money, I had to borrow money from my parents which feels awful and they also aren't charging me rent right now (I live in an apartment in an income property of theirs). My parents are retired and this property is their only income, and now that I'm not paying rent they aren't making any money on it. I feel absolutely worthless. I've tried applying to other minimum wage jobs but I get the feeling that they see my education and experience and figure I will just leave when something better comes along (which is true). 

I feel so worthless. I'm having existential crises almost daily, I keep crying which is something I never used to do. I make an effort to get out of my apartment, go to the gym, go on walks and volunteer but it isn't helping that much. I'm going to either have to get a roommate or give up my apartment and move back in with my parents. My friends are getting married, buying condos, getting new jobs and here I am still all fucked up. My confidence is in the dirt again (I suffered from Crohn's Disease for a few years which totally broke my confidence, that's in remission now thankfully but I am having trouble affording the medication) after it took so long to get it back. I've been drinking, smoking weed and eating mushrooms just to get out of my head once in a while but of course any temporary relief that provides just brings me even lower when it wears off. I've been trying to get sober for a long time (even went to an AA meeting a few weeks ago) about myself and then but I can never make it stick for longer than a week or so because I start to feel bad use. I feel like a fucking loser and I'm having trouble convincing myself that I'm not. I've always felt like a bit of a misfit but I'm starting to feel like I'm just not good enough for anything at this point. 

I'm so twisted up and I don't know what to do. ",Depression

"Having a crush on someone is killing me inside. This is how I've been feeling lately. I've married to my sweet wife about 4 years ago. We've been seeing each other for 8 yrs. We have settled into our life very well. We have a house together and every is good.

Wrong, something happens. And it's eating me from the inside out.  I get a phone call late at night. It's my wife. She was at work when she got the news. It was her sister almost killed herself. She had cuts all over her wrists and have been taking a lot of sleeping pills. Her dad has been very abusive. He's always been this way, even to my wife. 

We drive over to the city where her family lives to pick her up because of what's recently happen. She's got Christmas break so I told my wife that she could stay with us for a while for break. My wife and I still have to work we work different shifts. 

Sometimes it's just me and my sister and law and we just get closer and closer. We start flirting harder and harder. We end up getting really close. At the end of it I'm certain she's way more comfortable with me than my wife, her own sister. She keeps making excuses to end up on her bed in the spare bedroom. Nothing has happened. We dropped her off yesterday. I want her. I want her so bad. I can't stop thinking about her and texting her. It's terrible. I hate myself for it so much. I want it all be over. My stupid crush. I just need people to tell me it's never gonna happen perhaps...",Depression
"Im struggling to keep myself together. In October of 2017, I was having relationship issues and took a break from my boyfriend of 5 years. I moved 2 states away to live with family while him and I tried to work on ourselves for a bit. A few days after I got settled I decided to try to catch up with old friends. I asked a former close friend from high school if he wanted to get coffee or something sometime, he said sure. He picked me up and we went for a few drinks at a nice-ish bar. Unfortunately I didnt know him well enough, because I was drugged, beaten, and raped by him. I didnt go to the police until February of 2018 after I found out he also drugged and raped two close friends of mine. He was finally arrested this past August, and the next court date is next week. 

Just over a month after I was raped, I pulled a muscle in my back at work so badly that it wrapped around to my abdomen and made me think I was having appendicitis. I drove back to the office (barely), threw my truck keys to my supervisor (I was a letter carrier for USPS) and went to urgent care. Was told I pulled a muscle really bad and to take a few days off of work. I could barely walk, stand, or sit down. I went back to work on light duty/office work only but still couldnt handle that. I was home for months while workers comp gave me the runaround. In March of last year they told me they were going to rescind my case if I didnt send a letter stating why I needed to be out of work. I did, and they rescinded it anyway. I was forced to quit, which broke my heart because I loved carrying and made good money without needing a degree. Fast forward a few months and my primary care doctor diagnosed me with osteoarthritis in my lower back at the ripe old age of 24. 

My boyfriend made things work and I moved back in with him in April 2018. Were far from perfect and still have problems but weve come a long way. We celebrated our 6 year anniversary this past November.

Working and finding work was and is hard. I went back to bridal dress sales (which I did for a few years before USPS), but my physical limitations forced me to resign because I couldnt handle it all. I tried car sales because the money was enticing and theres a lot of down time. I survived only about 2-3 weeks, as sitting all day was making the pain worse and the atmosphere there was absolutely terrible. I found a part time prep cook job for a catering company, and Ive been there since September (I work 6 hours a day max and moving a lot keeps my back from stiffening up). There are still a lot of days that I cant get out of bed and have to call out. I need to find a different job that isnt painful for me and has a larger salary than what I make now but I have no idea what to look for. 

I was diagnosed with PTSD after being raped, exacerbated by my rather extreme anxiety, which is also paired with depression. I started antidepressants and got on a new anxiety medication in July. Ive had no side effects but the antidepressants arent working like they should.

My back pain started to spread this past summer. Depending on the day I have widespread pain, mostly in my back, shoulders, neck, and hips, thats anywhere from a 3-8 on a pain scale out of 10. Ive gone for two rounds of extremely painful steroid injections in my spine but have had no relief. I have to go for one more round in a different location, and if those dont work Ill most likely be sent to a neurosurgeon. My primary care doctor referred me to a rheumatologist months ago but they havent called me for an appointment and despite the constant calls to my doctor, nothing has really been done. All of these issues have caused brain fog and I have a lot of trouble remembering short term things. 

I havent seen my therapist since early November between the holidays and her taking vacation time. I have to call her for another appointment but a small part of me is hesitant to do so but I cant figure out why.

Between my mental health problems and physical issues and pain (I also have 2 thyroid conditions, one of which being autoimmune), I have no energy to do anything. I sleep a lot but I almost always feel exhausted. I dont call my family or return texts. They get mad at me and I try to explain to them that I dont do it purposely but the just say Im making excuses.

My family doesnt know that I was raped. I honestly hate 99% of my family (my grandmother, who raised me, is the only one I really get along with. And even then she can be difficult at times). They all gossip and speculate and cant keep their noses in their own business. My cousin started anti anxiety meds over a year ago and they STILL talk about it like shes a heroin junkie (I havent told them about my meds because I knew theyd do this exact thing). They all like to embellish stories and tell everyone they know about trauma concerning family members. I dont want anyone to know about this unless *I* want them to. 

I forgot to take my meds for the last two days and I feel like shit. Shaky, mind racing, increased heart rate. Anxiety is horrible lately and being off my meds for just two days has fucked me up. I finally got out of bed and took them this morning after having an anxiety attack where that nasty voice in the back of my mind told me I should just kill myself. Im not exactly suicidal, though I do often wish that Id get hit by a car, or shot in the head by a stray bullet, or have a heart attack in my sleep so I didnt have to suffer anymore. I dont have the moxie to end my own life. 

My life is basically sleeping, waking up, taking upwards of an hour to be able to stand up, take thyroid meds (which makes my stomach upset because I cant eat for an hour afterwards), limp to my car or call out if I cant walk. Endure anxiety attacks all day. Try to calm myself when PTSD inevitably flares up. Set aside 20 minutes or so to call various doctors/refills prescriptions/talk with my advocate about upcoming court dates. Do my best to not let the bodily pain get to me. Try to remember to take my afternoon meds. Make food for myself. Lay down, but not for too long otherwise my hips and back lock up. Try to remember to take bedtime meds. Sleep for at least 8 hours, wake up exhausted. 

Im just so sick of living like this. The only thing that helps my pain (mentally and physically) is cannabis, but my tolerance has gotten higher (pun not intended) and I feel like its lost its efficacy. Im tired of being tired. Tired of not being able to go out and do things. Tired of needing help to get up out of chairs or off the couch. Tired of existing.

"My subjective depression puzzle pieces. I've found that depression doesn't start affecting the whole brain at once; it starts somewhere, then it moves into the mind-objects, thoughts and feelings, that you try to enjoy. Which means you can enjoy some, rare things temporarily at times, but then it just fades away.

As an example, I played OldSchool RuneScape for 3 weeks in a row a very long time ago. This never happens to anything anymore. The reason this most likely happened was due to the exploration drive I had stored in my nostalgic memories. The drive just faded. The reward faded.

My theory is that depression is the incapability to feel reward that can expand. But it's improved by being able to feel reward, and actually feeling reward while being capable to. Adding motivation to the state of incapability to feel reward creates feelings of anxiety, which can turn into psychosis-like symptoms (in my case not medically related pain and numbness). The lack of feelings of reward causes brain-fog and lack of mental energy.",Depression

"Should I keep on reaching out to my depressed friend? Last year, I developed feelings for my guy friend, and we had this thing together for a while. I confessed to him, and he basically told me that he was depressed and wasnt in the right place for a relationship. He also apologized for leading me on when he knew he wasnt ready for anything. I thought his apology was sincere, so I forgave him and decided that we could remain friends.

So not many people know that he has depression, and he told me that he hates talking about it. When I had feelings for him, I would always be the one to reach out and ask him if he wanted to hang out or how his day was going. Ive stopped doing that so that I could move on, but I still try to talk to him. Im not trying to completely avoid him. 

Im getting annoyed because it feels like Im the only one putting effort into the friendship. He doesnt reply back to my messages unless its absolutely necessary, but in our group chat with our friends, he replies back to them a lot more often. If Im not the one reaching out, he never reaches out to me. Like I told him that I started a new job recently and he didnt even ask me much about it. 

Ive never been depressed, but Ive been on the verge of it in the past because of some things in my life. And I admitted all of those things to him when he opened up about his depression. He never replied back to me about it. Im not sure if its the depression that makes him seem so uncaring at times or if he just doesnt like talking to me. It does hurt my feelings when it feels like he doesnt care enough to reply.",Depression
"It's 2019, and I feel like this is it. It's the beginning of a new year, and many people are looking towards new things and new experiences. I, on the other hand, feel like I'm stuck. I feel like I have nowhere to go from here and I don't even feel like I made any progress in my life. Being 27 years old and still babied by my parents isn't how I pictured where I would be at this age. I feel like a liability. I feel like I don't deserve anything. 

  
Being a graduate with a degree is the norm these days, some jobs don't even require it. I wanted to go to DPT school but I fucked up. My grades were not spectacular and the crowd I hung with was not exactly beneficial for any aspect of my life. That cost me my chance of applying. Sure, some people will say it's on me for hanging out with them but  as I said, I fucked up. All I ever wanted to do was support parents and be sure that they can retire and enjoy the rest of their lives. That's what all parents deserve raising 2 kids after immigrating from their homeland. I found my first job, and it sucked. It was so bad that I cried every night driving home. I cried wishing for better opportunities. I cried wishing that I didn't fuck up so much in my life. I cried as I told myself things will get better. It didn't get better. After a year or so,  I left the company. There was no room for promotions, no room for raises,  and no room for improvement. I didn't want to waste my time fighting for a salary that they couldn't provide. I've stayed after an extra hour or two almost every day to make sure that all clients files were prepped and ready to go for the next day. My co-worker who joined my team last wasn't even given a raise to accommodate to the new duties she had to take on (Later I learned they had sacked majority of the office because they had an algorithm to do majority of the work). So I left. So much for that job. At the time of my leave, Cryptocurrency was blowing up so I decided to take a whack at it and learn day trading. I had some money saved up so I put in what I would be a good amount to generate some profit. Fast forward to today, all coins are down more than 80%. I lost a big sum of money so I fucked up again. Also, in the midst of unemployment (or self employment, however you want to look at it), I was diagnosed with a rare genetic disease. It affects majority of my organs because I lack a certain enzyme and I feel intense pain during fevers and in specific conditions. The doctor told me I needed to see 5 other specialists to see what I can do to manage the symptoms and any treatment would cost me around $200k a year for the rest of my life. Yay, another thing to add to the list. 



It's been over a year since my diagnosis and I feel like I've not improved or progressed since that day. I am still jobless with a depleting savings account. I've been applying and looking jobs but no bite yet. I am still reminded of my disease everyday because I am limited. I haven't seen the specialists and I don't plan to because of the cost. I rarely see friends as they are busy with their own lives. So I sleep. Every night for the past year, I've been dreaming, crying, and hoping that I figure a way out of this hole I've dug for myself. But now I realize this hole fits just right for me to lay in. I'm tired of everything and I don't know what else I can do.",Depression

"Need advice ? should I lie? About a year and a half ago, I had to move back home because I was suspended from my university.  My parents were obviously pissed about it, especially because they had been the primary ones paying for my school (~$10,000/year for 3 years) and because I had been lying to them for a couple of years about my grades.  

Fast forward to this fall semester and I started up again at a different university close to home, so I could commute and not have to move (rent is $0 with parents).  

Things had been going pretty well for the first month, but then the wheels basically fell off of the whole thing.  I started missing class, not turning in papers, etc.  I even got extensions for the late papers, but still never turned them in, which was really shitty to the professors.

The thing is, I was lying to my parents this whole time again about going to class and how things were going, and I was doing it way more often because I see them every day.  

Now Ive failed all my classes and Ive been suspended. My parents are expecting me to continue next semester, and I obviously cant, so I dont know what to do.

On one hand, all of the lying is making me guilty and anxious and it would be nice to have some emotional support for all of the shame from failing again.

But on the other hand, my parents, especially my dad, tend to hold grudges and give the silent treatment when theyre angry (after the initial yelling spell), which also make me guilty and anxious.  

Every time I would see them would be a reminder that theyre mad and how it feels like they hate me and I feel like I wouldnt even want to leave my room.

I guess Im wondering what I should do.  Try to lie my way out of this situation or tell the truth?",Depression
"Im feeling lonely and want a friend in my time of need, but at the same time Im pushing people away from me Ive had a really rough time this past year. Right before I turned 21, I found out I had a tumor that is currently benign (non-cancerous), but could possibly become malignant (cancerous). Ive always had a bad relationship with my family and moved out of state away from them two and a half years ago. Once I told them about the tumor and how I wanted to get surgery to get it removed, they kicked me off their health insurance. After years of trying to maintain my family relationship, Im exhausted from it and Im ready to give up on it, especially since theyre offering no support in a time like this. The situation has sparked some suicidal thoughts in me.
I feel like I dont really have many friends, and I feel like the few I do havent been treating me well. My roommate, who considers me to be one of his best friends, isnt there for me for emotional support. Ive explained to him the situation and openly expressed my feelings of loneliness and abandonment that surrounds it, but he doesnt give me the time of day. He hangs out with his girlfriend all the time, which in general Im okay with, but when I need him, hes never there. 
One night I told him I needed a friend because Im always home alone in the apartment. I also told him I wished this tumor was cancerous so could die without it being my fault because I was thinking about suicide but dont have the actual willpower to go through with it. He sat down with me for 20 minutes, basically saying that me that wanting a friend to spend time with me in person is expecting too much from friendships because everyone has their own lives to live. He told me I just need to find myself a boyfriend (Im female), but Im not interested in dating anyone, nor do I think Im in the right place in my life to start a relationship. He somewhat shrugged off my suicidal thoughts, making remarks like why would you say thatù and you dont actually think thatù. After the conversation he left to go to his girlfriends, leaving me alone in the apartment again. I know I cant really ask him to change his routine for me, but this felt really cold. Internally, I felt like it flipped a switch for me, and mentally Im thinking that no one really cares about me.
Since then, I feel like Ive been pushing away all my friendships. Friends I usually text, Ive stopped making contact with them. Some Ive tried to voice that I need help, but most of them dont know about my tumor or my relationship with my family. I feel like I cant tell anyone Ive been having suicidal thoughts either, so I end up just finding all the flaws in my friendships and cut them out. 
Its so ironic that I say I need a friend while Im isolating myself like this. I feel like this is unhealthy and I dont know what to do, but I dont know what other direction to take. Ive gone to therapy multiple times, but after the second meeting with them, theyd tell me another therapist could handle it better and push me to them. After the third one, I stopped going.
My coping mechanisms jump around, from smoking weed to drinking to hooking up with random guys to binge eating... Im trying to stop these habits because overall they only help in the moment and ultimately makes me feel worse about myself.
My mentality right now is to do everything alone because no one really cares or can help me. Does anyone have any advice on what to do in this type of situation? I just want to be better.",Depression

"failure I feel like I'm a failure at life. Throughout the 15 years of my life, I've accomplished nothing notable. I barely find enjoyment in anything, I have no talents, I have no hobbies, I've lost a majority of my friends, and I'm just weird.

As a kid, I have tried numerous sports, such as basketball, soccer, and baseball. I was never good at any of these sports, and I don't intend on ever playing a sport again. What worries me now is the other players. Many sports players are aggressive and mean, and I already know I'll find no enjoyment in playing a sport. 

I used to love art as a little kid, but that has changed now. I find no enjoyment in art for it takes a long time and I'm very, very bad at it. Looking back at my old drawings, they were pretty awful, and anything I try to draw now is as awful as 5 year old me drawings. I just find no enjoyment in art anymore.

Videogames are something I've always loved, but I'm not particularly good at any games, nor have I made any notable progress in them. For example, I play a mobile platformer game called ""Geometry Dash"", and I've been playing for around 3 years. A majority of this time went towards creating levels, but I have never had the motivation to actually finish a level, resulting in around 100 levels I've started but never finished. I only have around 2800 stars from completing levels as well. I now play barely any games at all, and any new game I try isn't enjoyable. I'd love for some suggestions! 

I am now in Freshman year, 15 years old, and I've lost a large majority of my friends I've made throughout middle school and even elementary school. I have a bad memory for some reason, and I can barely remember any fun moments from my childhood. My mom yells at me that I should be talking to people at my school and socializing more, but I don't think she realizes how hard it is for me. I am always overthinking the results and having anxiety if something remotely awkward happens.

And finally, I am just a weird person. I hum often, I make random noises when I'm bored, and I constantly fidget. Lately, I've been uncontrollably shaking my hands when I get excited or anxious. I'm not sure why any of this happens, but it happens. I'm not really ashamed of it at all, but from an outsiders perspective, I'm probably quite the oddball.

The only thing I am somewhat ""good"" at is school. I am in all honors classes and get consistent A's, or B+'s. I feel like my grades are useless when I don't have any hobbies or talents, because, what am I going to do with these grades? And like I've mentioned before, I forget things very easily, and I can barely recall things I've learned previous years. I am ""playing the game"".

Tl;dr - I don't have any talent or hobbies, but I've tried many things like sports and art. I like videogames but I'm bad and I'm losing interest. I am very awkward and anxious when socializing. I am a misfit. I get good grades, but they are useless without talent or hobbies.",Depression
"I don't know what to do anymore I need help. I hate myself to no end, everything about me is bad. I have friends but I'm still as lonely as you can be. No one is going to love me and no one new is going to talk to me. I just wish I wasn't myself. I have no one to talk to about this, for years I've just been locked in with myself.",Depression
"Everything is wrong, and I can't fix it Most things in my life right now, well, I wish they were different. But I can wish all I want, nothing is going to change.

-I can't sleep before 4 in the morning, before that everything in my head is buzzing. This sucks if you're getting up at 6 to go to school.

-I don't enjoy stuff anymore. I used to love to draw, but now it feels like a chore. I always had the energy to do my best on school assignments, but that's out the window too. My grades are suffering and I'm a failure. The only thing I have energy to do are compulsions (writing down numbers and patterns. They are part of why I can't sleep).

-I have Aspergers Syndrome. So not only am I cementing myself as a mistake and a failure, I was born deficient. 

-I am turning 18 soon, and it scares the crap out of me. I feel like a child still, 12 years old at most. I was very mature and adult-like at that age, but it's as if now when I need to be mature and strong, my child self is coming back, making me feel small and weak, insecure and timid. It's as if my emotional development has turned on its head.

-I'm starting to regret my childhood even. I wish I could relive it (who doesn't?). 
I didn't have the worst childhood out there (which makes me hate myself evem more for complaining), but my stepmom was physically and emotionally/verbally abusive, especially the latter. Back then I felt I had no choice but to do as I was told and just live with it. After all, I was just a stupid ungrateful child who did nothing but make my step mom's life miserable. Now I wish I had spoken up, told a teacher how I felt, heck, even go through with running away with my brother. Fight back at least. But I didn't, and there is nothing I can do to change that. I was a goodie-two-shoes when I needed to rebel, and I regret it every day.

-I had to give up my dog last year. She was born aggressive, and training couldn't fix her. I still love her.

-All these things make me feel scared, and small and cold and fragile. I hate it. I need to grow a pair but I don't know how. The people around me don't deserve to deal with my shit. My father is the best one out there. He stayed when my mom left. The fact that he replaced her with my hellish step mom isn't his fault. He deserves the best. I can't give him that. 

I'm sorry.

"I'd rather be dead then have to work. Working is such a mental drain for me, especially in hospitality.

"Post Holiday Depression Anyone else struggling with that post holiday depression?

Just spent two weeks out of town, half with family and the other half with friends. Even though I had an amazing time, there was constantly a part of me that kept longing for my own apartment, my own bed, my own isolated comfort zone. Got home last night to an empty apartment and the depression turned itself up several notches to fill the space left. 

Im sure it will pass. Part of me knows that once I get moving again, work on new goals like working out and eating healthier, that things will start to feel normal again, even if those goals seem incredibly daunting at the moment. I think I just had a difficult time transitioning in situations like this. 

To top it off, Ive been off antidepressants for about a year now. I keep telling myself and people close to me that its on my to-do list and cite some excuse like money or time. With the new year starting it brings fears of wondering if this year will be any different. 

This is starting to turn into a ramble. Just wanted to get out some of these nagging thoughts and see if anyone else was on the same wave length. 

Happy new year everyone, keep your heads up. ",Depression
"What is the chance that everyone in my family is depressed? Multiple family members, my mother and two of her sisters grew up with depression. My mom tried to kill herself when she was my age.

Queue myself waking up to hearing my sister and mother whispering and my sister crying. My heart is breaking because I was hoping she wouldnt have to deal with this. 

My kid sister is going to the same high school as me, and she is going to face the same feelings me. Im going to do what my parents never did for me, and make sure that she can go to therapy.

"I feel like I was cheated out of happiness Right now Im up at 4am because Im too depressed to sleep. I feel like I should be happy. I have a great job, I make decent money, and I have three dogs I care deeply about. However I find myself going paycheck to paycheck paying off debt thats accumulated from being naive and too trusting in others.

I spent six years in a relationship with someone who was secretly a trust fund kid. He said he worked as a consultant and things seemed stable. We started to plan the rest of our lives together and from my perspective were sharing finances. He unexpectedly lost access to his trust, maxed out my cards where he was an authorized user, and more or less ran. Every once in awhile I get a check from him, and its the only reason I keep a communication channel open. He claims he will pay me back, but its never enough to even cover the interest of the damage he caused - let alone the toll on my mental and emotional health.

I eventually tried to entered another relationship with a guy who helped me rescue a dog from a kill shelter. He had a job at the time. Rehabilitating the dog and seeing their growth from our nurturing was beginning to rebuild my faith in humanity. He then adopted a second dog. While I was concerned about if we had the time for two dogs, I felt we could make it work especially with the length he went to help me with the first. He then lost his job, and I spent three years trying to keep the family together - essentially paying for everything. I went as far as finding a new job and moving us to another city because he felt convinced he would be more successful in the other job market. After two years in the new market he still did not have a job. Depression was in full swing and I smoked marijuana heavily as an attempt to escape - until he came home with a puppy because he was afraid I was going to leave him. He wanted to try to make himself invaluable. While I didnt keep him, my mother took away my inheritance because I refused to give up the dogs. I refuse to be that type of person - because I feel I would lose the last of my self respect and faith by doing so.

Moving to a new city wasnt the worst thing in my life. I hated my old job and was much more passionate about my second job. After the first year though I felt less like I was making a difference and more like it was any other 9-5. I feel tolerated rather than liked and have difficulty finding common interests with my peers. As an example while Im into gaming, Im really a gear queer that goes to e-cycling centers to find CRT broadcast video monitors and 80s-90s PCs for vintage consoles and big box software than play the latest switch games. I find myself not wanting to get out of bed in the morning to go to work. I could find another job, but I stand to potentially make a lot of money from stock options and Im afraid the next one may be more toxic.

Right now I feel stuck in a loop. I spend most of my energy caring for my dogs and working side gigs to try to get the cash injection I need to move back out of a paycheck to paycheck situation. I started to see a psychiatrist and hes trying to avoid giving me stronger medication for fear of dependence. While I quit smoking Ive been promiscuous and having riskier sex. While I enjoy it and it is a cheap way to feel more alive, it does mean I need to get tested regularly. My out of pocket for medical is already maxed out and Truvada is completely paid for by my health insurance. Being a whore doesnt completely satisfy my loneliness, but its hard for me to believe anyone is really there for me. I feel like I work hard and its one of the few things I can take advantage of from my work. It still doesnt make me feel happy though.",Depression

"New year new me, I can do this and so can you. I've tried getting into some good habits last year but I never made it work for more than a few weeks at most.

This year I really want to do all that.

My plans for this year:

* Work out every day, at least a little bit. 5 minutes are better than nothing.
* Never skip a day brushing my teeth. Bonus points for brushing them twice a day.

Last year I got into a bad habit of not brushing my teeth sometimes, luckily the guilt I have about this at least makes me brush them on most days. I also wanted to work out but always kinda ignored it.

"I feel better since cutting ties with all of my (great) friends and spending the time alone NOTE English isn't my first language, I hope I'll be making myself clear.  
This is my first post.  


Up until Saturday night, everything felt sort of tolerable. I always walked around with a heavy feeling that seemed to distinguish me from the rest of my friends but I was used to it. Then on Saturday I was hit with what felt like a ton of bricks that flew me back to how I used to feel as a teenager. I felt like 15 years haven't gone by at all.  
I felt like an outsider, a loser at fulfilling my dreams and remembered every single relationship that ended because I'm always the one who's broken up with. I haven't cried in such hysteria for years and felt so helpless. I tried calling my best friend who's the most sensitive person I know and the phone call progressed to sobbing about the last guy who didn't want to see my anymore. She refused to talk about it anymore because she heard about it so many times before, and preferred to end the conversation. She didn't know it was all a part of something bigger (several things) that apparently didn't receive my attention for a long time.  


The most logical solution I could think of at that time was to delete myself from all social media and to stop responding to any of my friends' texts or calls. In my head, I felt like being by myself was my safety net to never having to explain myself to someone else or getting hurt. If I'm the only person I'm socializing with, I can set my own terms.  
To my surprise, ever since then I found that I don't miss any of them. Most of them are amazing people that I considered my family for the longest time, and I feel bad for not wanting to preserve that anymore.  
When I'm not at work, I mainly spend time at the gym, the yoga studio or read at home. That's basically all I do.  


I'm afraid that the peace I found in this new routine is the fact that I'm no chasing anyone's approval anymore. I don't hear about the get togethers I wasn't remembered to be invited to. I don't feel like if someone hasn't texted me today then no one really cares for me, because now they know not to text because I'd prefer to be left alone.  


Does this make sense to anyone else? Has anyone been in this situation before?

Rinse and repeat. Right now I cant keep up the act anymore. Im tired, exhausted and incredibly sad. I have only a boyfriend to confide in. I dont have friends or close family to talk to. My job actively requires me to talk to people and interact with others. (Im a social worker)

I couldnt bring myself to go to work lately. In a 5 day work week, I would typically take 2 days off. During which I wouldnt even eat or go out, Id lie down and do nothing but sleep. While Im away though, I do send emails from home and try my best to cover whatever ground I can from home.

Ive gone back to the doctor and Im actively committed to feeling better. Ive been prescribed medications again after defaulting for some time, and Im going back to see my therapist. Ive been officially diagnosed since I was 14. I did not reveal this to my employers. During the time of employment, I was coping well and built a good routine for myself. 

My bosses probably dont want this to carry into 2019, but I dont even know where to begin. I want to tell them the truth about how Ive been feeling, but I dont know how supportive they will be. I love my job and dont want to lose it. The job is the only real connection I have with the world.

I've decided to put an end to all of this after 28 years of suffering. The way I've arrived here is too hard to explain, but I can tell you I've been fighting with live all my life and thinking on this for at least 7 years. It's difficult for me to explain how I arrived at this point, but I'm sure there isn't any other solution for me.



Always since I have memory I've been different, or better said, people see me different than others. I never understood why.  
I remember all my memories with pain, always with pain. Starting when I was a child, I've suffered bully all my life from my classmates and then when I got a job, this became in ""workplace harassment"". At this point the sad thing is changing my job isn't any solution, because people always hurts me when they know me better. It's and endless spiral.

I never made a friend in all my life. People always treated me like I'm a strange, like if I'm dumb. They've always laughed at me, at my way of being, at whatever I do. And doesn't matter what I say or what I do, people always judge me different. People avoid me and if they want me, it's to take advantage. I feel everyone is playing with me all the time. People don't value me.   
It doesn't matter how clever you are, or how many studies you have. People don't believe in me. People don't listen to me whatever I say. Everyone ignores me, even my therapists (you can't figure how sad makes me).  
There isn't any person in the world who can live in this way.

And more I try to make friends or socialize, more I realize how I want to end this suffer. I get pain when I try to move forward and improve my life. People is very bad by nature.  
All my life I've been a social outcast and I can't uderstand why.   


I'm in depression since I was 13. At these time I didn't know I was suffering depression, and never realized that until I grow up and understood some things. The sad thing is I realized that I never understood myself, the place where I live, the people and the meaning of the life itself.  
Since 13 I've developed ""problems"" derivated from anxiety and depression. I have incredible memory and concentration problems that makes me I can't wear a normal life, but don't worry, even my therapists don't believe what ""that weird guy is saying"". I can't think clearly and affects me a lot when I have to express myself, like for example writing this text. I won't type all Depression and Anxiety problems, but it's like I don't know who I am anymore, I can't recognise myself and I can't fix it.  


So, later I've learned and understood from where comes a lot of my problems. Nowadays I realize I always had a toxic family environment, a lot of low selfsteem from my fathers. I know I can't blame them, but it's the truth and it's the base of my problems for all my life.

I understood that life is genetics and lucky, and unfortunately I never had these things on my life. I never had control.  


I know no one will understand me, like all my life has been... but I think it's good for society to know others feelings and emotions.  


Every day its a war, and damn, I've been fighting for so long. I can't handle it anymore. I'm so tired.   
Once I arrived at this point with no solution, I only want peace.  


All my love to everyone.

"It's really helped my depression greatly not being at work the last week. Knowing that, how can I survive when work resumes? It's not completely disappeared of course, but having this week off has enabled me to really invest in myself and engage in more 'mindful' tasks.

I've also done a lot of things I've been meaning to do - fix stuff around the house, service the car, etc - at my own pace. These things are now no longer thorns in the back of my mind whenever I leave or come home from work. It feels 'healthy' to have these things done and maintained.

In the mornings I go and grab a coffee and just chill out for an hour. Been really enjoying my own company and the pace not being at work gives me.

I've also done a lot physical stuff like joined a rock climbing gym and have done a lot of cycling.

So, it feels like work is the opposite of this. I'm never home, so things that should be fixed up remain broken. I never have time to go to the gym (I do try to get in exercise by cycling to and from work) and sitting in the morning with a cup of coffee for an hour is out of the question.

I don't think I am a lazy person, but it feels like a lazy lifestyle kinda helps my mental state. But, I've got bills to pay, of course, so I need to work.

So, I guess, how can I 'survive' when I go back to work and have no more time for myself?",Depression

"Strange/obscure sensation, can anyone relate? Hi /r/depression. Idk if this is literally a depression topic, but I have this odd sensation that tends to pop up more when my depression is worse. I've talked to a few close friends and family members, but none of them experience it and I really wish someone out there could relate because it's such a disturbing feeling.

The only way I can describe it is that it's an empty or almost tingling feeling in my chest or abdomen, almost like the feeling of being exposed, or horrifyingly vulnerable. Not *emotionally* vulnerable, but existentially, totally vulnerable. Like being a bug that may be squashed at someone's smallest whim. I sometimes get this sensation when I'm getting out of the pool, but mostly I get it after very particular dreams and nightmares, usually really scary ones where I am being hunted down, or where I have to kill myself to avoid something worse. It leaves me shaking and sweating, but it's such a real feeling I can't help but feel fascinated by it. To some extent I've always felt this, but it's gotten more frequent and intense as an adult. 

So basically the feeling is empty+creepy, but very physically felt.

Just had the best 4 days of my life just because I was told by someone after the trip that he was super happy with me and he will always remember the trip. He approached me for friendship on the first day (he is grade 6 and I'm 11th) , at first I was confused because I never had anyone just come up to me for years lol. On the 2nd day I just got comfortable and started talking to him a lot, at the end we exchanged numbers and after I reached home I apologized to him for annoying him (I always end up saying sorry just so they don't think that I'm a bad person) but he told me that I made him really happy, I MADE HIM HAPPY?

"Here goes nothing. So I trust no one enough to say what I truly feel about everything, this is my first time making this publicù, so here goes. Its a long one. 

I have been depressed for about 6 years or so. It has gotten better and worst with the years. Im 27 years old and I just cant take it. I have a barrage of mental illness that have come up cuz of different situations. I cant leave my house without having anxiety, cant go to a club cuz Ill have a fucking panic attack, interaction with people is a headache (Im a bartender, Whoopie). When I was little a guess a wasnt taught well how important it was to wash your teeth, now Im missing all my top ones except the 2 front ones. This is my main problem... cant afford repairs cuz it cost about $7,000, and thats the cheap one, I am fairly poor so paying that is practically impossible unless I dont spend a penny which is a no go. Almost nobody knows this. I get panic attacks just thinking if someone knew about this. This has been so difficult to keep like this. From 2 or 3 year back I barely talk to anybody just so I dont expose my mouth. When people talk to me I usually just nod or use my hands. If I have to talk then Ill try to look away as I do for the same reasons. You have no idea how hard it was to adapt to be like this. I cant fucking smile when Im happy (which is not often), cant laugh, cant flirt, can do absolutely anything. I havent had a relationship in 6 years. I cant talk to a girl or anybody. Tried to ask for help from my dad but he ended up telling me things that made me even more depressed. It makes me angry that Im good at things, and I cant show or express them because of this. My confidence is on the floor. Im fairly good looking on the outside but still theres that thing. I dont know man... I just dont se a way out... and I know this is the only thing holding me down... it hurts me so bad that I cant have a normal life, and its all my fucking fault. I cant stand it. Its so fucking hard, to see people being happy and having their shit together, yet I cant have any of that. Im tired, exhausted, sad, worn out, weak and more things.. I dont really know how much more I can take. At least till now I dont have the balls to hurt myself but I know its a matter of time till I do. Im worried, I really am.

Ill probably add stuff later on Im really tired right now. ",Depression
"If I don't hide my depression completely, I can't deserve my own life. I don't know if it makes sense, but I feel like the only way I can deserve to be around the people I love is by hiding every single sign that I suffer from depression. My family (who doesn't know for sure that I have it) is totally sick of those times I can't hide depression very well because I'm irritable and apathetic and tired. A beautiful relationship with a wonderful guy ended recently because of my mental illness was too much for him to bare. He [20M] tried to be supportive at first but he felt pressured and stressed out and bummed whenever I [20F] talked to him a little about how I felt. We're still friends and we still love each other, but it makes me so sad to think that I was making him so miserable that he had to just be away from me. He would be happier and my family would be happier if I didn't have depression, but I can't snap out of it, so the only thing I can do is to just pretend I'm not depressed. To pretend I'm really happy, so I don't ruin everyone else's happiness. 

It's just so fucking hard! Being in the middle of a crisis and not being able to tell anyone even the slightest thing about it makes me so sad and anxious I want to puke, literally. It makes me feel like I'm drowning and the only thing that gets me a little relief is hurting myself and/or fantasize about being beaten up and being covered in bruises, scratches and blood. Thinking about how tiring and painful (emotionally and physically) it will be that it makes me wonder if I will end up killing myself in a few years with a lifestyle like this. I have nobody to talk about this problem, the only person who knew for sure that I have it is my ex boyfriend and even though we're still friends and he says he can listen if I need it, I can't keep talking to him about this. We broke up so he could feel better and happier and I don't want to ruin it with my mental illness.

If I can't pretend everything is fine, then I should simply kill myself because all my loved ones would have better and happier lives without me and my depression in them. I know me committing suicide is not exactly a solution, but it definitely should be. 

TL;DR: My loved ones can't see me showing any signs of depression because it ruins their happiness, so I have to stop it, by all means. How can I do this?

Btw, sorry if the grammar is incorrect, it's really late and I'm really upset, so I'm not thinking clearly. ",Depression

You could say it gets better and maybe it will, in 4 or maybe 10 fucking years from now, but Im not waiting that long. Yeah sucks all 16 years of my pathetic existence has been spent in school, never done anything I wanted to do in my life. I just wanna say a quick fuck you to society and this world. The only thing about life thats true is that its not fair.ù Life is not fucking fair. Ill miss my dog so much, but thats it. Everyone else has fucked me over,  people at school, friends, and even my family, people  who are supposed to be there for you. WRONG! I will be gone and hopefully in a better fucking place than this world. Maybe Ill burn in hell like my mom said, maybe Ill have a nice afterlife, or maybe Ill just be in a fucking coffin in the dirt. I dont know and I dont care. Life definitely isnt for everyone. Its most definitely not for me. Yeah blahblahblah Ill just kill myself now and Ill be one less miserable person to ruin everyones day.

Even my therapist. I dont cry in sessions, it makes me super uncomfortable. Its hard to hold it back sometimes but I do. But then when I tell him I spend three hours crying every night and have started obsessively thinking about death again he doesnt seem to believe me.

"Why is depression so hard to overcome? Its hard to overcome because it specifically effects a persons thought patterns, feelings, and perceptions; the MIND. Especially if someone has suffered with it for years; the longer one has it, the more ingrained it becomes in ones psyche. The thought patterns of a depressed person doesn't work like a healthy persons. The depressed brain is sometimes deficient in certain brain chemicals, or, has an over abundance of certain chemicals. It also has to do with the persons family history; if they were abused in any way, suffered thru traumas (PTSD), substance abuse, and the familys history of substance abuse and other abuses.

Many people who are depressed dont just suffer with that by itself; often times its a dual diagnosis, such as doing drugs to self medicate, and escape, anxiety, OCD, psychotic features, personality disorders (BPD), etc... Depressed people internalize social cues, people's intentions and actions, behaviors and comments. They often times take things the wrong way, are over sensitive, think people are always talking about them, think people automatically don't like them, feel rejected often, and think of themselves as being different, weird, and outcasts. They blame themselves for other people's perceptions and opinions of them, and are almost all the time pessimistic. It's a flawed thought process that is systematically self destructive. All of this is hard to change.

There IS HOPE! Therapy/dr, Jesus, medication, a support system. All will help the person overcome, but?the person has to WANT to change, and work on it WITH a dr/counselor, God, a family member or friend. Research your type of depression, study and learn about it. Find out WHY you have it, and how you can help yourself get better.",Depression
"Therapy was the best thing in my life. So this is going to be a long one. Also english isnt my first language so fuck ups might happen. 
(Germany)

My childhood wasnt the best. With 4 years my Mother divorced my Father. She got in a new relationship fast after that. He was abusive (physicly, mentally and sexual) to me and my brothers. Somehow my mother never new what was going on ( I still wonder about it to this day).
When I was 6 he kidnapped my mother and tried forcing her to marry him. They left me and my brothers home to starve. 
Lucky to us was that im not easy to bring down. I cared for my 3 Disabled brothers for 3 weeks until the neighbours realized what was going on and calledthe Police. 
They documented our bodys and askes us many questions (CPS was there). 
Since I didnt know where our Mother or our Father was they put me and my Younger Brother in Fostercare and my Older disabled brothers in a psychatric clinic. For 4 months we wouldnt see us.
On the 15th Dezember 2003 we drove with CPS to SoS-Kinderdorf. At that moment we didnt even know what that was.

You could think now that this should be the part of my life now that was going to be good. But no.. it started all over again. I was abused mentally and physiclly again. I always got told that I will end up like my father (who was a drunk no good person) that i will never have something good happen in my life that it would be better if i was dead. At that moment i was 9yrs old. It was only one person that did that to me. He also beat me quite often. They found out and fired him a few months later.

Fast forward 6 years.
Im im Realschule now. My Grades are good only in math i struggle. Im getting 6's (f's) quite often.
So they (sos-kinderdorf) decide without me knowing that i should repeat the 8th class.
I never had many friends but after that I had no friends anymore. 
I had only one thing in my life that was pushing me to go forward. The wish to become a soldier in the Military (Bundeswehr). Everyone was telling me that i wont make it through the Musterung (i dont know the english word for it). But I did. I got a Contract for 4 Years with the Pioneers.
But now shit hit the fan. I got ill. Super fucking ill. I lost 25kg (50pounds) and couldnt walk for weeks. They dropped the contract. I lost everything in 2015. Only thing that kept me alive was my gf. But in 2017 I couldnt keep it anymore. I wrote Good Bye Letters to all of my Family. Got in Bed and tried to end it on 25th of Dezember
But something kept me from doing it. I dont know what it was. Maybe my Cat. 
 The next morning I went to my Doctor told him everything. Soon after that I had my first talk with a psychologist. And on November 7th of 2018 I got into a Clinic. I got the therapy i needed. I am now finally happy to be alive again. Im not only surviving the day but living the day. Im not scared anymore more. Im happy and want to see what the future is holding for me.
I hope you all have a wonderful 2019.

I cant kick my Mom out but at the same time I am not happy having to take care of her already at 26. Its an endless struggle.

"Thing I wrote 4 years ago It was the day before her birthday that she ended her life. It happened at about 10pm. Her skull was bashed on the brick floor, killing her almost instantly. Flies flew around her body, analysing the perfect spot to lay eggs. Where a life ended it begins new life. However the girl did not want new life. She cursed the day she was born, and did not want to live through that day again. For her, even though she well recongnised that this was not true, every single living being felt harmful to the world. The flies did not find a good spot. They flew away.
Everything that went into her became nothing. The effort, the love, the worry, the money, the care all vanished into thin air. She became inedible meat. Once she was so alive, but the other day she became dead meat, nothing, no one, a ?thing that seemed like it was never alive in the first place.
And her brother was still cross at her because he couldnt go to the buffet. Her mother was angry; she initially meant this event to be happy and enjoyable. She had booked a meal with her daughters name. It was all because of her. Everything was, after all, her fault.

I look in the mirror disgusted at what I am because I am not the person I wanted to be. Hell, If I was a different person I would hate the current me.

Most people really dont any redeeming qualities about them. People are better than me in every way. The only reason Im alive if because Im biologically told to. Reasonably speaking Im better off dead. I have nothing really to contribute to society that will make me happy.

On the topic of happiness. Its fake. It will never happen. You happy version of you will never happen because that will require everything to go perfect in your life and theres no such thing as perfection. 

Time is a son of a bitch. All these years I spend blowing it all away on a life I could only live once. My teenage years? Gone. Fucked it up, didnt even get to experience ANYTHING. 21 now and havent even set foot on my college campus that Im almost flunking out of. And I know people will say ?oh your only 21 you still have so much life ahead of you. Bullshit. Im never going to change. I learned that about me. Its never going to happen. Thats because my personality revolves around me being a loser.

And to the things that help people cope in this world: drugs, alcohol, smoking. Never even done any of them. Thats probably why I never socialized in school because I couldnt find anyone else like me. I was also too afraid that it will make my life worse than it already is somehow. Beside I have no money to spend on that anyway. 

What a sad excuse of a person I am. No matter what face I put on the outside. I am always miserable 24/7. Nothing ever makes me happy, and to the things that make me content, video games, tv shows, gym. I realize that they get me in no way closer to the person I want to be. (Except the gym where I later realized that I have a health problem that prevents me anything close to my goals).

"Help This is basically just a simple ask for help. Ive been depressed for as long as I can remember, but I wont get into that right now.

Ever since starting online school, I feel more depressed than ever. Like I thought I was depressed before, but oh lord no. And I have no clue what to do about it. 

I kinda feel like Im stuck doing the same thing over and over again with an utter lack of motivation. So, Ive tried to jump start my life again.

Ive been hanging out with people more, trying to change up my look, meditating, but nothing helps. I still feel like the same old depressed slob I was before.

So, what do I do? How do I make everything I do meaningful again?",Depression

I don't have any friends I can talk to.
I watch a lot of Anime just to fill the void that is inside of me.
I fucking hate myself.

"Grieving over someone I still see everyday In 2012, I lost my mom. One chilly January day, I came home from school to find my mom buried under her blankets, screaming and shaking with sobs. My grandparents were there too. They were spouting some stupid shit about God's plans. She screamed for them to get out.

I don't remember how, but I was informed that earlier that day my mother's car was filled with bullets by my brother's drug dealer. 

I was barely 12 years old and I had no idea that my life was about to change completely. I didn't know that I had lost my mom. I wouldn't realize that until 6 years later, when I finally started therapy.

I've always been a mommy's girl. My mom was the strongest women I knew. She was so beautiful, so smart, and the best mom I could ever wish for. She was my sun in a family that was filled with alcoholism, drugs, fights, and trauma. She was an amazing artist. She could fix anything. She was the kindest person in the world. She was my hero. 

In 2012, it was like a rug was swept out from under me so incredibly fast that I didn't notice it was gone. I returned to school. I didn't tell a single soul. I heard kids gossiping about the shooting in the newspaper, sometimes to me. I heard lots of ""why didn't they just drive away?"" ""they're probably druggies"" etc. 

I didn't cry. What reason did I have to be upset? No one was injured. My mom was sad but I can help cheer her up, I told myself. I told everyone I was fine! I wanted all of the support to go to my mom, the one who needed it. 

I started to get sad, all the time, for no reason. At 13 I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety, and I started trying medications. My mom fussed over me and I strongly rejected her. I didn't want to make it any harder on her. I witnessed firsthand the affects of PTSD. Thunderstorms, loud noises, dreams would leave her crying and shaking, and there was nothing I could do. To this day, almost everytime I wake her up she'll startle and scream (it never hurts any less)

I can't get into any more detail between 2012 and the present, because I barely remember any of it. I remember moving from my dad's to my grandma's to a stranger's and back to my dad's. The only constant was my dog (my guardian angel!) 

I remember watching my entire family turn against her. Withdrawing support because she wasn't recovering fast enough for their liking. One day my dad sat me down and for hours he tried to convince me that she was actually crazy, and insane, and that I needed to get away from her. 

I remember the stress and missing 20% of my days at school. My teachers hated, hated, hated me. I'd call in sick all the time. I wouldn't do my homework. I'd show up late every single day. It's a fucking miracle that I had anything above D's. 

I remember crying myself to sleep, cutting myself, starving myself, the **constant** suicidal thoughts. I vividly remember planning my suicide hundred of times, but never coming close to going through with it. There was NO way I could. I couldn't do that to my mom. I was trapped.

I didn't make it through the first year of highschool. I was  having panic attacks on the daily. I told my mom I couldn't do it anymore. She said we'd figure something out, we could homeschool... what a joke.

2018 has ended, and I'm still stuck here. I come home everyday to a woman - she looks like my mom, she has the same name as her, she has the same voice - but she's not her. We don't have deep, long conversations about life anymore. We don't draw together. We don't go out to eat - in fact, she never leaves the house. Except to shop with my card. 

I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know anymore. 

Soon it'll be time to move out, but what then? I'm scared she will never get back on her feet. If I leave, her disability check won't cover rent, utilities, food. I was out of a job for a few months and in that time we got incredibly incredibly behind on utilities and rent. I can't imagine what will happen if I move out. I think she will lose the place. 

Speaking of - I really should be asleep right now. It's 2 AM and I work from 9 to 6 tomorrow. I'm just... using Reddit as my diary tonight, I guess. I feel a bit better now that my thoughts are written down.

Goodnight, post that I will probably immediately delete.

"In a previous job, after telling them about my depression they let me go (failed my probation) because I was too negative. Has this happened to anyone else? If it did happen to you, how did you get over it? It's still really impacting me especially when getting a new job",Depression
"I visited my sister for new years, it didn't go well, I'm at a loss. Feel awful. My sister and I have always had a strained relationship. She holds grudges against me over things that happened at LEAST ten years ago. I'm not saying I've been the best brother, I used to be a pretty awful person. I was un-diagnosed bipolar and schizophrenic and a drug user. I was unhappy, selfish, and made a lot of dumb decisions. I never went out of my way to hurt her intentionally, but she just happened to be a bystander. On the other hand, she also has done a lot of hurtful things to me as well, and said some pretty ugly things to me, but I've done my best to apologize/forgive her and move on.  I have had my shit together for many years now, no longer make the same mistakes, or accidentally hurt people, or even intentionally hurt people. 

Anyway, she invites my mom and I out to stay at her place for new years. I drove ten hours to get there. I didn't know what to expect, but at the same time felt great because this was the first time she had ever invited me to her apartment. I thought this could be a breakthrough in our relationship, I went there with an open mind and open arms. Ready to settle things or at least continue to improve our strained relationship. Which, while better, is still strained. 

But the second I arrived she was less enthusiastic to see me. She was only nice to me when drunk. When sober she'd either not talk to me, or not engage in conversation when I tried to start one. She disrespected me the entire time, and treated me like I was basically just a fucking idiot. Like nothing has changed. I'm not expecting a fucking trophy, but I don't get why she invited me out in the first place? My mom, sister, and I had a conversation the first night, and she explained some things. Things that really made no sense as to why our relationship was bad. Or that literally did not happen at all. She also treated my mom like shit as well, which only made me more angry. But she'd invite friends over, go out with a friend, have friends join us when the three of us go out. Which I wouldn't mind, but we drove 10 fucking hours to visit her, and she treats her friends like they are the greatest people on earth. But my mom and I are just two idiots and she just constantly threw out demeaning or negative remarks about us, her friends however are just perfect people. 

I couldn't wait to leave. I apologized to her again, I took responsibility for my past actions, I agreed with her that yes, I used to be a pretty terrible person. I owned up to it. I told her I was proud of her and that I love her. But now as I sit here I almost feel like cutting her out of my life completely. I don't think it's me at all, I think she's unhappy and projects a lot of it on my mom and I. It's no less hurtful, devastating, frustrating, and numbing, though. 

I got so drunk on one of the nights I couldn't speak, I ground my fists against the wall in the bathroom until they bled. They are now torn up, bruised, and bloody. I realized I don't want a person in my life that would bring me back to my old self who would put me in a frame of mind of drinking just so I didn't have to connect with the situation, and self-mutilating because I'm so fucking angry and feel like such a fucking idiot. But of course now that we're gone she's texting us these happy-go-lucky texts, and I don't have anything to say to them. 

I'm just glad it's over. I just needed to get this out. I will always love her because she's my sister, I'll stand up for her if other people try to take her down. I don't hate her. But I also feel really disappointed and tired and drained and just completely done with her treating me this way. Or why it's okay for her to never apologize or take responsibility for all the shit she's done to me in the past. I want a better relationship with her, but I'm done trying. I want to continue bettering myself and improving myself, not having all my mistakes thrown up in my face every single fucking time we have a conversation. I'm not a fucking monster. 

So, I'm officially done with trying. I'm moving on for my own benefit, and I hope she finds peace and happiness, but it's sad that we'll probably never be close, and even sadder that at this point I don't even care anymore. Or maybe I am a monster? I have no idea. 

Does this just sound like a toxic/negative relationship that would be better off excised from my life entirely? Do I deserve this? Or do I keep trying because she's my sister, my blood, so I'm supposed to? This fucking sucks. I'm nearly suicidal over it, but also understand that's an overreaction and I just need to heal and move on. ",Depression
"How do I know if I have depression Ive tried explaining my situation like 5 times but cant figure out how to lay it all out so basically I have no motivation to do anything, stopped caring what anyone thinks, my main motivation in life just got shot down, kinda think about suicide but not really, and the main one is I dont know what to do at all and I have no clue whats going on in life.

Things were so much simpler and I didnt care about growing up. I felt so loved and it was so much easier just being alive. I was so excited about life and what it was going to bring and now I feel so sapped by life. I didnt have all of these intrusive thoughts and I wasnt always alone in my room and I was just so happy. I think about waking up and being 10 again so often and going downstairs and helping my dad make pancakes, and having such an active imagination and appreciation for the world, and how that might never happen again. Maybe its just because Im lonely right now or maybe its because Ive been so stressed or maybe its because Ive been having all of these really intrusive sexual thoughts from my OCD but even when none of that is the case I just think things would be so much easier.

That's because they are nice to me but they don't want to do anything when I try to see if they want to do anything outside of school.

"Feeling guilty about seeking help I made a new account because I don't want this associated with any of my normal accounts.

I do not feel as if I am worth saving. I know pity party and what not give me all the shit in the world I don't give a fuck, that's the way I feel. 

Yet at the same time I find myself in a situation where I can't just up and die. People would be harmed by it. So now I'm conflicted. 

On the most basic level, I don't think i want to live anymore. On so many levels, I am sick of this life. 

On one level, I am disgusted by humanity in general. We are such a terrible species, exterminating so many other species on this planet without a second thought. And the way we treat each other.

There's so many other issues too. On another level, i hate myself for all my mistakes in life and especially the ones i made twice or thrice over. And another I dislike my family for being a perpetrator of this harmful ideology. 

Yet like I said before I have responsibilities and people who depend upon me. If I didn't this thread wouldn't be here, instead you'd just be hearing about the case of some weird homeless guy who died in a Domino's dumpster. 

So I'm in a situation where I clearly need help but I simply cannot bring myself to get it. Not getting help is hurting people, including myself. But getting help and increasing my economic productivity would also hurt people just in a more indirect fashion. 

I know this may seem like highschool-level dilemmas here but I feel it on a personal level and the reason why I feel like it's a highschool-level thing is because most highschool students learn not to give a shit and instead just play along with the system. Whereas I'm of the mind that if it's such an obvious problem that a highschool student can identify it, it's probably a pretty fucking real and serious problem that I'd be morally corrupt to ignore.

"Are depression and self improvement two sides of the same coin? Through my experience with depression, some of the things that helped me most were self improvement techniques.  I notice a lot of them have roots in cognitive behavioral therapy (for example creating healthy habits).



It's just mind blowing how different people react to the phrase ""improving my mental health"" versus ""working on self improvement"".  The mental health stigma really makes no sense.  Why do people have to be ashamed to work on their mental health when people glorify productivity and self growth?



I was just thinking about this because I was almost kicked out of the house on Christmas since my parents one family of friends over. My father was embarrassed to have me around since I'm currently struggling with depressing and binge disorder.  However, I had actually lost 20 pounds before going home for Christmas and my father actually wanted me back to begin with (though he probably didn't know exactly how unhealthily overweight I was since I mostly talk with my mom about these things).



Side note: I actually called the suicide prevention hotline wandering around outside on Christmas Eve.  On one side, it was nice that the caller listened to my worries.  On the other side, it felt like I was listening to the caller's training.  She seemed to be checking boxes (asking questions to gauge how suicidal is this person, asking to see if I'm a danger to anyone else, what are nearby local mental health resources).  I guess the hotline is the best a stranger can do. Maybe it's more about my disappointment in the effectiveness of professional mental health care but I'm rambling now.

Basically, anything to really do with having a conversation. I find myself to be a really interesting person,  but I just cant get the hang of sensibly explaing myself. Although, at times I can. Most times I get really nervous (especially with a girl) and I either make myself look like a fool, or I stay quiet. I need some advice! I don't want to be alone forever, I like the me time but I want a girlfriend and I want to be able to get around the world (school and work) without feeling self-conciouss about the way I speak.

"I feel like ive beat depression, but i still feel suicidal at times In the last few months, alot of things have changed. From turning 13 to gaining a few good friends, many of things this past year brought to me remained positive. I no longer have days on end feeling unhappy or useless, yet most of the thoughts i had while in my depressive mental state still remain. I really dont listen to them but do think of how things would happen if i did end my life. It seems less of a plan, and more of a hypothetical question now. Have i really defeated depression or am i just becoming numb?",Depression
Crippling Loneliness Just wanted to write this all out somwewhere but Im feeling so lonely of late to the point where I physically feel empty. Ive never been in a relationship and never been intimate with someone. Im 24 and I feel like its just never going to happen for me.  Im just so afraid of fucking it up or taking initiative or being ridiculed for never doing anything. Im in school too in bum fuck nowhere. Ive been dealing with anxiety which doesnt help but fuck it Ill go through the motions act like everythings ok on the outside like I always have. ,Depression
"I feel empty and hurt even though its my own doing and Im a massive hypocrite Before you try to decide whether or not Im actually an abuser. Ill spoil the fun for you and tell you that Im currently in therapy/anger management for emotional abuse.

My and girlfriend have been ?together for 6 years. She has endured probably the worst fucking relationship any woman can ever endure. In the first 2 years I was 17-18 years old and very immature so I cheated on her behind her back with 10-12 women. One of them was a prostitute. (She didnt find out about any of them, I told about it years later but we will get to that)

For the 4 years after that (before she found out about the cheating ofc ) I decided to pretend none of that ever happened and from that day forward I was going to be loyal and committed. Because in my 19 year old head that was the only important factor in making a relationship work and I wanted to grow up and be a big boy.

For 3.5 of those years, I am not exaggerating when I say, I was a lose cannon. Ive never beaten my girlfriend up but I have screamed in her face over absolutely nothing of importance. And to show you just how stupid I am Ill give you an example.

My example

Girlfriend took coleslaw to work to add it to her salad. 

She forgot to bring it home.

I noticed it had gone out of the fridge and she told me she had forgot to bring it home.

I proceeded to throw food at the wall screaming I can waste food too!!!!ù

End of example 

Im guessing youre wondering why she was even with me. So am I, probably something to do with the fact that abuse victims feel attached to their abusers. As with all abusers, I was nice to her sometimes and gave her gifts, but it was all part of the abuse cycle that I was constantly in. 

The relationship was fucked, she stopped caring as much so I started dumping her more often. 

She started talking to an old friend who had recently tried to commit suicide. She ended up meeting him to catch up. Obviously she didnt tell me or ask me because Id of gone mental over it. 

This guy starts to see an entry point in my girlfriend, he begins calling her when she knows I wont be with her. Like on her way home from work.

2 week later she dumps me, during an argument because shes had enough. A day later she comes running back crying telling me she doesnt want to break up and she wants to see if the spark is still there between us. I say to her Ill get back with you but we are only giving it one last chance, if it doesnt work this time then Im out!ù.

1 WEEK later, my abuse cycle finishes ?calm mode and turns to ?tension building mode. ?Tension building doesnt normally take long to turn into an ?incident... and it didnt take long. Another 1-2 days go by and I tell her weve tried to make it work but it just isnt working between us, weve tried and weve tried but it isnt working. We said we would give it one last chance and we have.ù

We dont make up after that and she goes to a party. I call her at the party and tell her youve left the fucking iron on, this I why I cant be with you! Youll never learn, I just cant be with you. Dont come to my birthday!ù 

So she was in every sense of the word DUMPED!

So eventually when youre in a dysfunctional abusive relationship thats constantly ending. You reach, ?the final straw and thats what that was. So she called the guy from her school and asks him to meet her because she was upset. Ofc he invites her over to his, Ofc he makes a move on her while shes at her weakest point and Ofc she lets him have sex with her.

Next day my abuse cycle turns to ?reconciliation  so I apologise profusely to my girlfriend and ask her if we can make up! She said yes with the most bland and fed up face Ive ever seen her have.

For the next 3 weeks another plot twist happens. Turns out the guy she slept with has a pregnant girlfriend that he never mentioned and is a completely wanker just like me. He starts texting her telling her he needs ?ú50-?ú100 every few days. Later it became apparent that this money was being used for his cocaine addiction. But he told my girlfriend that he needed the money to pay his friend otherwise he was going to tell everyone what happened between them. (Obviously at this point I still didnt know, because she knew I would have kicked off that she slept with someone so soon after breaking up)

Basically indirect blackmail.

During this time Im still dumping my girlfriend on and off completing multiple abuse cycles. Because now they had really started to get quick. Sometimes Id complete an entire cycle in 1 day! 

Anyway the guy from her school blackmails her one time over text and forgets to delete the text messages off his phone. His pregnant girlfriend finds the texts and sends them to me on Facebook. I confront my girlfriend about it and she confesses everything. I have a minor melt down, except in the opposite direction this time. Instead of been abusive I run away for a few days to sort my head out.

Me and my girlfriend speak about the entire thing, I forgive her, even though theres nothing really to forgot because under the circumstances I had nobody to blame but myself.

I learnt a valuable life lesson, or so it seemed. 

I had learnt that if you want someone to be loyal to you, you dont dump them. 

And

If you want someone to tell you the truth about stuff, then you should act at least slightly approachable.

For about 3 months we worked of things, I stopped being abusive. And it really seemed like WOW shit is actually getting good. BUT, I made a really stupid mistake. 

In my head I had fixed myself and I now knew everything I needed to know about how to do a good relationship. So I refused to go to therapy.

Big mistake. 

Turns out as more time goes on you begin to forget the details and remember the main stuff. So I stopped seeing it as I dumped her and she had a reboundù and began seeing it as she cheatedù. 

Annnnnd the abusive cycles come back, not as bad as before but definitely back.

I dumped her yet again. 

I moved in with my mum and we didnt talk for 2 weeks. During this time I met someone from tinder and slept with her. And my girlfriend met someone from tinder and had foreplay. 

Me and my girlfriend ended up texting eachother again. We decided to take it slow but after a week of feeling eurphoric,  we had unprotected sex. 

Guess what happens when you have unprotected sex? 
Yep! 

She got pregnant!  Yeeeey! Im sooo f*cking stupid! 

#Thats basically the end of the chaos#

Im actively in therapy and anger management

Ive told her about my cheating past also.

We came clean about what we did while we were single

We are financially okay for the child

My girlfriend is living as my mums with me because she has nowhere to stay and I dont want a pregnant women living on her dads sofa. If things we well and I sort myself out fully, we will live together but right now my mum is being really supportive and wants to help with the child which is great for us.

My therapist has confirmed that I am insane, not in those words but basically. Ive been told that I can be a better person and I cant manage my emotions in the future. For the time being Im not aloud to get angry with my girlfriend, I must remove myself from the room, because Ive not yet managed to fully control my emotions. 

Im not going to tell you me and her are going great now because thats what an insane person would say. But we are back to not arguing and back to the good place we have previously been at, except this time with therapy. 

I find it hard to deal with the fact she went somewhere else even though I genuinely cheated in the past and she didnt actually cheat and I struggle to accept it all in my heart. Because an abuser isnt something thats easy to come to terms with. I often feel betrayed and find it hard to accept that its my fault and she beat me at a silly game that I created.

"I feel lost and alone All my life i was made happy easily, and always was excited. I would bounce off the walls when my mom wanted to go to the store with me, so it was the simple things that did it. Flash ahead to sophomore year of highschool and i hit a low point of depression and was put in a hospital due to the mental abuse of an old friend group, nearly putting my life on the line. Im a huge violinist and loved to play. It was an exciting hobby that i could express myself through, an outlet, along with video games. Shortly after my experience at the hospital i started to better myself. I started to get back to my old ways of easily entertained and happy from whatever

Here we are in 2019. High school grad, freshman in college with good grades, loving family and somewhat decent friends. I met a girl, we dated for awhile and things were great i was the same, happy person. Then, in November i started to feel the sick empty feeling of loneliness. My girlfriend and i broke up, due to me being too clingy and affectionate, because i wanted to not feel the way i did, my family had a huge falling out at thanksgiving, that i was apart of. I felt even worse because i lost touch with all family other than immediate. My friends noticed i wasnt the same,and tried to help, but it didnt work. I still feel lonely, and nothing makes me smile anymore. I cry myself to sleep every night and have been for a month.

Am i the only one who feels lost and lonely? Or is there something wrong with me?",Depression
"I don't know what to do I don't understand why I do this. I do online school cause I didn't feel like going to normal school anymore but I extremely lack social interaction and it makes out for being extremely lonely. I go through stages where I think I'm going to be alright and I'm cool on my own and then it just breaks down again and I feel like shit. I lack the courage to go back to normal school because I know how shitty people are there and I feel like the downs out do the ups of it. I got really fed up with being lonely a few months back and I started texting a girl I met on insta and she was super sweet. She lived a few states away but she genuinely liked me allot and she cared for me and made me happy. I was talking to her for like a month and I started getting this sinking feeling in my chest whenever I talked to her and I don't know why like everything was going perfect with her and I just started to feel like shit again and talking to her made the feeling more prominent so I literally blocked her on everything because I'm a fucking dumbass and I didn't know what else to do. And that really hurt her and I regret it so much. 2 days after I blocked her she messaged me on steam because I forgot to block her on there and at that point I had to explain what happened to her, she didn't deserve to be left in the dark about it. I apologized over and over but she never talked to the same way after I did that. Which I don't blame her for. I started cutting again when I realized what I had with her wouldn't come back and I just stopped talking to her because it wasn't working. It's been months now and I think about it all the time and I still don't know why I ruined my own happiness like that. I feel absolutely horrible right now and I just want to talk to her I have no one else to talk to and it's been months since I talked to her. I don't even know if she'd respond so I just came here.

"My SO is severely/chronically depressed and is hesitant about medication. Help? I'm making this post because my SO has had severe and lasting depression since childhood, severe anxiety that is showing some pretty obvious characteristics of OCD, and they feel stuck in their situation and unable to find a way out. I will call them Van.   


Van wants to take medication if it will work, but his anxiety disorder makes him terrified of side effects, particularly permanent dependence on medication or permanent negative side effects. He medicates with weed and nicotine just to get himself through the day, and recognizes that he has the personality type that takes the dosage to an addictive level (i.e. constantly increasing, always dabs rather than herb). Every time he decides he wants to try medication, his family talks him out of it and makes him increasingly afraid of the side effects. Meanwhile, I've noticed he isn't taking care of himself at some pretty basic levels and I'm worried that he's just suffering more and more. I feel awful that sometimes aspects of his life outside of his control are contributing to his depression as well.   


I don't want to get involved with the family, so this post is for Van so he can read everyone's responses and make his own decision and feel more empowered to do what he thinks is best. What medications or treatments (doesn't have to be traditional medication) have truly helped you with severe depression? What were some turning points that helped push you to get more help than just surviving each day?   


**TLDR; My significant other has had severe depression for many years (as well as anxiety) and while they have a prescription for an SSRI, they are often talked out of getting it filled and have deep fears of side effects ruining their life. He tells me he wants to feel better but is paralyzed by his own disorder and fears, and doesn't know where to even start. What are your suggestions for those of you who know someone who successfully manages their severe depression? (does not have to be an SSRI, can be anything that worked long-term)**",Depression

My fear still keeps me up with thoughts in the night. Perhaps fear isnt the right word (the feeling is more like something gnawing at me). Its uncomfortable and what I am actually afraid of is I have no power that I can see logically to change it. Anyways if you got to here thank you for reading.

"2019 is going to suck. 2018 was the worst year of my life. Worse than my mom getting cancer as a kid. Worse than my dad passing away a few years ago. I dealt with so much bullying growing up that I feigned illness almost constantly, to the point of the school threatening to hold me back. I had almost no friends. The ones I had were just as willing to bully me as anybody to avoid getting bullied themselves. When my dad passed away, I decided to go to college to try to make him proud. I was working a low income job at Walmart. I was going through the motions, stocking shelves, then sleeping all day until I had to get up and do it again. I went to college, and for a while, it was fantastic. I met new people. I was making friends. I felt like I had real friends for the first time in my life.

Little did I know, those friendships meant little to nothing to everybody but me. 2018 was the worst year of my life. I finally decided to start trying to tackle my depression. I went to counseling 2 times a week. I went to the hospital, met with a psychiatrist. Willingly enrolled myself in a psych ward because something really awful happened that overwhelmed me. I've been through 3 counselors since then. I've met with intake to see a psychiatrist to get meds. I've tried meditating. I've tried mood tracking. I've tried EMDR. I've tried reaching out to new people. I've tried posting on reddit. I've tried picking up new hobbies. I've done everything I can think to do, and nothing improves. I'm more lonely now than I ever was. I struggle to make connections with people. I try really hard to be a helpful person. I think I'm a good person. Despite being poor, I buy people drinks if they don't have enough money at school. I help people with homework even when I can't do my own. I stay up with people. I give people advice. I give people things. Yet my friendship is meaningless. As soon as I'm not present and useful, I'm as good as a ghost. People always told me that my problem was that I didn't reach out. That in order to make friends I needed to reach out and force friendships. 2018 that's what I did. Around a dozen people I tried to reach out to and get to know really well. I messaged them daily. Asked them how things were going. Helped them when I could. Male and female. Single and in relationships. This was difficult, so very very difficult. Yet, as soon as I'm not around, I vanish. I want to be optimistic. I was optimistic going into 2018, but 2018 destroyed me. I put more effort into my mental health than I ever had done before. I spent 25 years ignoring my mental health entirely. Faking happiness, and spending my nights feeling awful and suicidal. I thought putting in effort would help, but it hasn't. It's just made everything feel more hopeless. I want to be optimistic about possibly getting medication, but I know it won't help. All my friends who have taken medication are miserable. All my family that take medication are miserable. I'm so tired of people telling me medication will help. It's exhausting. Some of the most depressed people I know either have taken medication, or are taking medication. I've yet to be honest with anyone about what actually goes on my mind. I'm worried I won't tell the doctor the truth. I don't tell anybody the real truth about what's going on in my head. I want to be optimistic, but I can't. I've been beaten down too many times. I hate that I have to exist in this world where nobody really cares about me.

"I Thought I Was Improving, But Now I'm Not So Sure I dealt with some anxiety and depression for as long as I can remember, and it's gotten really bad in the past.  Then once I graduated high school this past spring and went to a seasonal job across the country, and even after I got back home mid-August, I felt I was really starting to improve.  I wasn't dealing with much depression or anxiety, and that was all I wanted.

Now I'm really not so sure if I really was improving, or just lying to myself.  I failed one of my only 2 courses for my fall semester at the community college, and my parents are threatening to make me stop if I fail another course this semester.  To make matters worse, I haven't managed to find a job since coming home, so my parents are paying for everything for me now.  And of course I can barely function on my own right now, even so bad that I never really leave the house at all now.

Now I feel like my only hope left is to go back to that seasonal job I had this past summer.  It's pretty much the only reason I'm pushing on still, and I'm scared of what I might do if I don't go back.

I have no friends in my area at all, and I only talk to people outside of my family online.  I honestly haven't left my house much at all since I took my finals.  I feel like if I died now, it wouldn't matter much.  I'd just be forgotten about as soon as it happened.  Hell, it's gotten to the point that I look forward to the stage in my depression episodes where I become numb, because it gets rid of the pain.

I feel like a burden to my family, and forgotten by everyone else.",Depression
"Having to adjust to a new norm is causing some extreme depression Im not even sure if this is the right place to post this but Im having a hard time and looking for some advice going through a hard breakup all Ive ever know out of high school is being in a relationship skip forward 5 years and getting dumped 3 days before New Years is a good kick in the gut Ive always been told being a man is too not show emotion but its super hard , Ive never had to deal with depression Im into the gym and it takes my mind off things but I really need to know what people do for the nights before bed when all I can do is think , what is there to do ? Im going insane ",Depression
"I feel like Ive only recently started to take everything in I dont really know how else to explain it, but I feel like its only really been recently that Ive started to process everything that has happened throughout my life and everything that Im sure has affected my mental health. Some of it is definitely genetic, but a lot has happened that I think either didnt help, or made it a lot worse. I think processing everything is part of whats making me bad again because it keeps causing things that I want to forget to resurface and reminding my brain of the terrible things it can do to itself. When I was a teenager was definitely when it was the worst.

Ive always been the type to question things, and used to always ask myself why things were the way they were. I used to get frustrated when I didnt have an answer.

Now that Im an adult, I understand that there isnt always an answer. Sometimes things are the way they are, just because. I cant keep searching for an explanation, and I need to somehow move on.

But sometimes moving on can be a destructive process when it involves reliving painful memories.

I think it boils down to a few things. Why was I bullied so much throughout elementary school and high school? Kids can be mean, and dont always understand. I never really fit in. I was bullied about literally everything imaginable, from the time I started kindergarten to the time I graduated high school. Every year it was something different. A mix of different people and a mix of different problems.

I never had many friends. It felt like everyone else had all these friends, while I was just forgotten about. Sometimes Id hang around big groups of people, but I never really felt like I was wanted or like I belonged. At the end of the day, I still had few people I would get close to or could relate to, and a lot of those people ended up betraying my trust in some way, or slowly turning on me. Theyd slowly start being mean to me. Ive always been kind of socially awkward, but I guess Ive gotten some better. I guess Ive always been kind of different. People have taken advantage of my passive and reserved nature, because it made them feel better for whatever reason. People used me, and it normally took me awhile before I realized it. When I did, I was always really hurt. That happened over and over, again from the time I was really young. How does a child understand that?

Even now that Im older, I really only feel like I relate to a few people, and I want to accept that maybe thats okay. Those few people are the ones that Ill learn to trust, and in the end, maybe those few are all that matter.

Ive never really felt that close to my family. My sisters are all interested in different things. My parents felt distant growing up. They werent bad parents, but I dont know if they really knew how to show love and affection to a child, because of their own issues and upbringings. Ive never really felt that close to them. There was also a lot of random family drama growing up, and my sisters all have their own issues too.

Starting to feel this way at a young age and finally getting help when youre in your early teens is hard for someone that young. You dont understand why you feel the way you do. The doctor trying all this different medication and referring you to different specialists is scary. You dont understand whats going on. And of course, nobody else at that age does either, so youre left feeling even more alone.

I dont know. I dont even know why I wrote this. I just havent felt great lately again, and these thoughts keep coming into my head. I think its going to take me awhile before I finally just accept everything and move on.

But thats part of the process, I guess.",Depression
"Tonight I am hollow I wish this new year could feel like a clean slate to me, but it doesn't. I had a really great New Year's Eve with my friends. However, I've been home from college for Christmas and while it's been nice to see (some of) my family and friends, I can't help but feel so hollow. For every one good day there are maybe seven days where I really feel like this. I am a shell. I wish I could feel this kind of driving force that inspires people to keep going. I'm not at risk for suicide, but the thought does cross my mind. I don't necessarily want to kill myself, but sometimes I just wish I could die without having any say in the matter. Like quietly pass away in my sleep. I'm so tired. Gathering up the energy to do ANYTHING is such a challenge. I know that if I see friends and keep busy, I'll be better off, momentarily. But I just don't know if it's worth it sometimes. I want to be a normally functioning human being. But my brain won't allow that. And it's so frustrating. I hate it. I'm slightly hopeful that things will get better, but I'm not so sure. I don't even necessarily feel sad as I'm writing all this down, just numb. I want to feel something so badly. I have friends but still I feel so alone. I feel like the friend in the group that everyone secretly doesn't like that much but just tolerates. I am an unnecessary add on that would not be missed that much. I just can't take it anymore. I hate feeling like this. My therapist told me that I should consider going on antidepressants and I'm open to that but I'm scared. I keep drinking and smoking because for some reason that makes it easier, momentarily at least. I don't know what I'm expecting by posting this, but I just felt the need to shout into the void I guess.",Depression
"Small things Sometimes you just want to do something just to overcome the sadness that's been eating you. It's not something necessarily big, it's something even just small. Small things like fixing up your bed, playing your favorite video game, or going out of your house. You thought if you do these small things, you will eventually forget the sadness you have. You didn't. 

So what should you do? Do you continue doing something small or do something big? 

You thought that if you just do something even so small, you'd be happy. But no, sadness is just around waiting for your return. ",Depression
"With all the noise I make about it, I feel like people will still be surprised when I finally get around to killing myself. There's just no fixing me. I can't fix myself, and no one can do it for me, even if someone actually decided that I was worth it. 

I'm fat. I'm ugly. I'm boring. I've no redeeming qualities. I've no hope for happiness. 

Suicide is inevitable. I've told many people that I want to kill myself. All it's done is make people like me less. I just have no reason to live. My life is pointless. No one will ever love me, and I'll never do anything noteworthy. My only contribution to this world will be another tally mark in the statistics.",Depression
"An update After a suicide attempt in April of 2017, Iã?è am so happy to reach Jan 1st 2019. Iã?è am here and so very happy to say all of this. After years of therapy sessions and medications, Iã?è have very few depressive episodes. Iã?è feel that old heavy blanket lifted from life finally. Back then, my thinking patterns were very unusual. After therapy, Iã?è learned to recognize how my thinking patterns were not healthy. For example, the world is not black and white, and just because event A happens, does not mean B will happen. Iã?è also learned how to cope with bad news and to not immediately jump to conclusions. My thinking is more rational in my opinion now. Iã?è have really, truly set myself up for a wonderful life. Iã?è wanted to die at 19. Iã?è am so happy and excited for the rest of my life at 20. Iã?è have met the love of my life (weve been dating since the June after April 2017). Iã?è left my old life behind. Left school because Iã?èt wasnt fulfilling me anymore. Started my life career. Surrounded myself with so many lovely friends. Now in 2019 Im going to start a family. Iã?è never knew Iã?è could be here, but the point is that Iã?è put in the work Iã?è knew Iã?è needed. Iã?è saw the beautiful life Iã?è could have and went through Iã?èt all. Even when Iã?èt was hard, Iã?è saw the red flags and the warm signs of my depressive episodes. Every time Iã?è saw a therapist or a psychiatrist after a red flag, Iã?è got one step closer to the happy life Iã?è always dreamed of. Never give up because a beautiful life youve always dreamed of is out there. Its real. You deserve it. Keep going! ",Depression
"I am now graduated, yey... So, as the title says, after five years of struggle, I now have a Law degree (takes five years in my country). The problem is: I hate everything related to this course, since it is just more problems that I will have to deal with while fighting against my own problems (depression, etc).

I have chosen this degree in a moment of uncertainty in my life, hoping that it would get better in the future, but I was wrong. Now it is like that I have wasted five years of my existence in a path that I feel complete disgust in tracing.

What makes it even worst is that my parents supported me financially to be able to graduate and now they obviously expect some kind of success in my future, even though I am completely lost and can not stop thinking I misspent everyone's time and money.

Feels like I will carry this burden in my chest for a long time and the light at the end of the tunnel does not exist. The pleasure of doing things in life was gone many years ago, which makes it even harder to find something to pursue.",Depression
"Getting some things off my chest I'm not depressed for any other reasons beyond the choices I've made and the powerlessness I feel to achieve anything worthwhile in life.

I'm a 28 year old man with ADHD and although that's fairly common and there are others like me who aren't depressed and life happy successful lives, I'm not one of them.  

I can't remember the last time I was happy. Maybe it was back in my school days when I was medicated and the playing field was more level.  Maybe it was with the one girlfriend I've ever had who's life I made miserable because I'm an insecure asshole. Maybe I'll never know happiness again. I look around and see people doing regular every day things I'll never be able to do - driving, having relationships, having friends, learning how to do things.  All of that is so beyond my wheelhouse.  I'll never drive because I will no doubt get distracted and kill someone or myself. I haven't had a girlfriend since I was 17 and honestly I doubt my dick even works after all the porn, masturbation, and overall desensitization towards actual real sex and real women.

I haven't made any new friends since college 5 years ago.  I didn't make any friends in 2018. Didn't get invited out even once. Didn't go on any dates or even have any prospects.  I don't think I'm bad looking either. I get my fair share of attention from women but once they realize I'm socially retarded and that I can't hold a conversation to save my life, all attraction is out the window.  It is what it is.

Lastly, I can't learn anything.  I can't learn any skills or hold a job.  I've never gotten a promotion at work or a raise, and rightfully so.   I'm failing at entry level work abs getting outperformed tenfold by kids who aren't even out of high school. Its a horrible feeling having passions and dreams and yet knowing I can't ever achieve any of them because my brain doesn't work.  

I'm on welfare, I take the bus everywhere and every time I open my mouth, the person I'm talking to cringes.  I don't think I'll ever be happy so I've redefined my goals.  Instead of wanting a family and kids and a nice house, I want to just disappear somewhere and live out my days peacefully.  I'm tired of being a burden in everyone's life. I'm tired of not knowing how to make the right decisions and I'm tired of people not wanting to be around me.  I'm content to just watch the world go by and not interfere with (who I call) ""the capable people"".  I just hate the life I'm living, the person I am, and the limitations that I can do nothing about.  I wish I could apologize to everyone who's unfortunate enough to have to have dealt with me at any point in life.  I live with nothing except regrets and it's all I think about 24/7. 

Lastly,  I'm not okay. I haven't been anywhere close to ""okay"" for a very long time, and i doubt I ever will be.  I doubt I'll ever be happy,  have friends or a girlfriend (or even a FWB).  I'll never have the high paying fulfilling job or have game night with friends.  I don't think I'll ever feel anything beyond extreme regret and sadness.

But it is what it is. I've adjusted my expectations and hopes and dreams accordingly. ",Depression
"I hate my life. I hate my skin, my loneliness, my clothes, and my overall position in life. I hate my inability to socialize, talk to girls, know what to even talk about, or do anything that pulls me from this shit cycle Im always in. Im an introverted virgin loser.",Depression
"I feel so defeated. Everything is just a mess. I'm in my 20's and still haven't gotten my High School diploma because I had given up on myself/education a long time ago. I've been working to get it now, but I have a feeling I'm only going to fail because I'm an idiot and have been one for years. Evidently, since I don't have the diploma, I don't have a job because I need every ounce of my weak brain power to get this done. I never learned how to drive since no family members had time. I don't have friends, just friendly aquaintances that I don't have any real connection with. If I died today or tomorrow, they wouldn't be affected by my death, and even if they were, they would forget about it a week later. I've lost every little bit of social skill that I once had due to extrenely low confidence. Even when I was decent at being social, it was practically useless because I still failed to connect with other people, unless it involved those who were passionate about music/bands/musicians. Now I can't even connect with people on that level because the musicians and bands I used to adore, I no longer feel attached to. I wanted to be a musician since I was about 4 years old, but, upon realizing I couldn't sing, which was what I intended to do, I had a desire to play drums. My dad eventually had the money to buy me a drumkit, and I learned to play. I absolutely adored drumming, and it was extremely theraputic for me, but lately, my love for that has died too. The last time I played, I did so to try and get my mind off of something, but it didn't help, which had never happened before. Also, since everyone always talks about how little time the world has left, I see no point in pursuing my old dream. I already have a crapload of other things I need to get done, and there's no way I can do all of that and continue practicing/try to find dedicated people to play music with me/try to get better equipment/etc. At this point, I dont even know if I would want to be a musician. I always said I didnt want to live my life like a basic member of society and that I wanted to be unique, and technically, I have done it by literally being a failure. I'm my own greatest disappointment. On top of all this, I fell hard for a person who was perfect. This person, although neither of us intended to find a relationship or anything deep at all, we did, and we found it with each other. We connected immediately, which is strange considering I don't connect with people often. This person and I talked to each other every single day. Even when I was studying, and they were at work, we talked whenever we found time. Endless phone calls, videochat calls, and messages were consistent with us. And when we spent time with each other in person, we were one another's greatest priority. I'm not saying this is absolutely over now, but things have been different between us since November. We had a misunderstanding and failed to communicate our problems to each other, and by the time we did, we each felt that the other was being apathetic. We've since patched things up, but it feels like they no longer care, although they have continued to say that they do care. They have been busy with various things, and they're unable to talk to me as much because of these issues. I feel that they are telling the truth, since I've been lied to enough that I like to think I would be able to see through such by now, and plus, they have always been open and honest with me, even when I didn't enjoy hearing it. I'm having withdrawls from the person, and I feel like I can't do anything without missing them or thinking about them. It's even been affecting my dreams ever since they've been gone. I miss them so much, and I feel like I've lost a huge part of my life and self since November. I'm convinced that I can't get through any of these issues successfully, and I'm  convinved that I will never be happy again. 

Tl;dr: Twenty plus year old that doesn't have a High School diploma, a licence, a job, legit friends, social skills, or joy for things she used to, and believes the one person she has connected with, who makes her feel happy , is slipping away. ",Depression

Im naturally an introvert/loner and spent my time alone at home with my pets as my husband works a lot and is not home often.

"as soon as I wake up, I want to go back to sleep just so I dont have to think about anything Ive dealt with anxiety / depression / ptsd since I was a young kid, it runs heavily in my family.

I go through times where im stable enough to get through my days, and sometimes its hard for me to even go out. shutting everyone away, something im really good at 

for a few weeks, it was this nonstop feeling of loneliness that i felt that made me feel the need to always be doing something with people. I would go to gym every day, work, then sleep for a bit &amp; then end up going out to hang out with friends. Id stay out late, smoke weed with friends, come home, repeat . 

now im at the point where I dont even want to go out, or see anyone. just gym (if i can get myself to), work, then sleep for half the day. and when i wake up, I just want to sleep again. not only that, but im still tired.usually when I wake up from a nap &amp; its later in the day, Ill just smoke indica so I can go back to sleep. its honestly so much easier than having to think. Im just at the point where I dont know what to feel. dont want to feel. just want to sleep. the point of being so unhappy, that I dont even remember what it feels like to be happy

"I often times think it may have been better if I had died I just turned 24 in December. In August of 2018 I was in a life threatening accident that nearly cost me my life.  As a result I've lost most of the function to my left arm (thank God I'm right handed.) I've graduated highschool but did not attend college. I've been working in the restaurant industry since I was 16 so effectively a third of my life. This was the all experience and skill that I had.

I've been slowly gaining back the function of my arm, with an emphasis on slowly. At this point I've become a burden on my family and friends.  As the medical bills continue to pour in with no real way for me to pay them... I don't know... I'm scared. I'm lucky to be on my parents insurance but that only covers so much. Meanwhile my father broke his wrist and the family dog was hit by a UPS driver. The dog survived thank God. But after the medical bills between myself, my father, and our beautiful dog my family is tapped. 

After my accident i require extensive physical therapy. A lot of which I skipped due to financial reasons on my own accord. (I couldn't afford the 80 copay every week.) My parents are basically out of money to help. My mother just took another loan on her 2nd mortgage to pay for our dogs medical bills.

I don't see myself ever having those things. People get mad at me when I say that, I'm not an ugly girl. But it's just the truth. I'm a store manager, part of the reason I'm depressed is because my job is so fucking mindless, and so are the people around me. It's the same shit every day. The people around me can't think. I guess I can't either. My other job is working in a retail store as well, and the store manager is 30 years my senior. I can't imagine ending up like her.

It's the first time in my life i'm actually looking forward to the future with genuine happiness. Something at work is coming up, i'm finishing my bachelors degree in summer. i lost weight, gained confidence and improved myself in many other ways. i started going out of my comfort zone. i also started going a little weed, but its ok :)

in 28years i never had a real relationship, but i know its just a matter of time now. don't stress it.  
and i think its actually better that way. now that im happy with myself i can make someone else happy.

i have to say i didn't have anything thats terrible wrong in my life. i'd say over all i was quite lucky for so far.  
my mom, sister and grandma have always been there for me. no matter how moody i was. i had very few friends. no real ones actually. but i have now. i was a loner you could say.

i understand some of you have way more stuff to worry about, i get that.  
but if you drown, it doesnt matter if its a small pool or the ocean.

i just had no drive, no motivation. i was absurdly sad for no reason some times and just didnt want to be anymore.  
my mind played games on me.

it basically took me my whole adult life to realize this. but now i know who i am, what i like and what i want. and i want A LOT. so good thing i didnt do anything stupid.

stay strong, reach out. try changing things. start some sort of class you're interested in, start working out. if its means to go out if you usual ways and you comfort zone: do it. but also keep doing the things you enjoyed so far.

i know this might sound easy, but believe me: it wasnt. it took me everything i had to get here. prob the biggest fight of my life, a 28 year long war with myself.

It's not even just verbal abuse sometimes when he's upset it gets to physical abuse towards my mum. And like right now I'm suffering from not only depression but also like social anxiety all off the charts and I can no longer live in my own person bubble where I pretend that everything is okay when it's not. I've tried seeking help I've asked my mum to divorce him and let us move out together.

Whenever I tell her I don't want this I can;t stand it anymore she screams at me and tells me how I'm so ungrateful to my dad and how there's worse in this world and how I can never ever call the cops. I've reached out to my school counsellor but I can't talk about this issue to anyone because if my counsellor knows my mum might hate me and I'm going to lose my only form of support. And like I hate it that not only do I have to deal with this going on every day I also have to deal with my social anxiety and now my panic attacks. I really don't know what to do anymore because everything is so suffocating. It's too hard waiting till I'm 18 to leave, as a matter of fact my mum thinks that I'll continue living in our home when I'm in uni to save money (sydney prices are like wow). And like I have to deal with my social anxiety as well as dealing with all these problems at home. I don't know where I should go anymore and I can't kill myself because If I kill myself I don't know what my dad would do. From his previous actions maybe he would actually go and kill my mum because he would blame my problems on my mum raising me incorrectly. Right now he doesn't abuse me phsically because I stay out of my way but recently because I wasn't willing to use the google dictation to put in an address he screamed at me and called me a c\*nt and then was almost not willing to drive me to the station. It's just so hard because like the fact that only my dad can drive and my mum can't drive makes it so hard to get around and like I know I sound so ungrateful right now but I'm really so grateful to my mum for like taking the young me in like a stroller to places via public transport or walking. But like when people ask about oh why are you walking why are you taking public transport it just fuels into like my social anxiety. And to be honest right now what I'm going through is nothing compared to my mum she's living in her own bubble to cope with things so she's not willing to accept I have depression and so I have to go to a counsellor behind her back it's just so hard. When I told her I can't cope with the abuse anymore she asked me ""why, you're not the one suffering I am, your dad doesn't do anything to you."" But it's like this guilt that like I can call the police and make everything better. But with my dads personality if I do call the police on him I'm scared when gets out of jail he's going to come kill me. ",Depression
"Finally going to see someone I have an appointment next week to see a counselor.  They will refer me to a psychiatrist after that if needed. I probably will. 
I'm already on medication for depression but things have gotten so much worse. Already had a suicide attempt back on 2017, but I made it through. 
I've noticed it's gotten worse over time with different aspects of it. Boyfriend's mom works as a peer advisor at mental health clinic and has been super helpful and in a way told me I may have a different mental health issue. 
So to start the new year I called my local health clinic that has apparently really good doctors and works with you for payment. I'm excited but also terrified.  I've been really bad since October and the thoughts of suicide have come back stronger and then go away. Currently I'm in a low spot and figured if I could share my good news it'd maybe help someone else. Not even after 5 mins after I made the appointment I sunk super low, and I couldn't focus on anything and wanted to die. I keep telling myself I just have to make it to Tuesday. That's all I have to do for now. 
Sorry for long rant....I just needed to get this out...figured here would be a good place. ",Depression

I go to the gym but the typical rush of energy and power I feel slowly fades and Im left feeling nothing. 

I just lay. And my head hurts. And I think of all the things Ive done wrong and things I could be doing. The old me would jump up and push himself to change this but that motivation is severely lacking.

"Feeling down and cant get my wife to understand Im not really sure how to start this but I (28m) have been feeling so down for so long. Probably a few years at least, but it really hasnt hit me so much until the last few months, as I am in between work projects and have nothing but free time. Ive always thought that I might have depression, but Ive never gotten myself checked out. My wife (25) seems to think depression is only situational and isnt really easy to discuss all of this with. We have a great life and no financial troubles and were even adopting a 2 year old boy right now and we couldnt be happier about it. Despite all of that, I feel like doing nothing all day and just seem to distract myself with tv and movies and it feels like Ive just been avoiding all of this sadness Ive been feeling. Recently I watched a documentary called Three Identical Strangers (which is incredible btw), which kind of gets into depression and mental illness, and I really wanted my wife to watch it and was excited to watch it with her. We tried to watch it and she didnt want to finish it. She said, Can you just tell me what happens? I get the gist of it.ù She reinforced her feelings of depression being situational while we were watching. I got so disappointed after this and I realized that I was subconsciously excited for her to watch it because it might show her a bit how Ive been feeling and help her understand, but it didnt change anything. She tells me that I should open up to her more because I have been talking less and less as time goes by because I just would really rather sit in silence. However, anytime I try to open up about how I feel it always seems to get shut down and invalidated, so I just feel stuck.

"At the point in this cycle where ""maybe I don't need medication? Maybe I'm not crazy?"" I stopped taking Abilify cold turkey in November.  I've been out of Adderall since September.  I'm still taking Wellbutrin but I'm not sure what it does, and I'm considering going off that as well, just to see where I'm at after a few weeks of not taking anything.  I haven't been completely unmedicated since...2009?  Although the cocktail of meds has been switched up a little since then.  Anyways, all that is to say, I don't know what's me anymore.

And like...I know that can be the kind of language people who are fundamentally against medication use, or who may have pseudoscientific beliefs about mental health, to dissuade others from taking medication, or to discredit the concept of psych meds.  Like that medication can make you lose yourself, turn you into a zombie, etc.  And I can also get behind the ""if you can't make your own seratonin, store bought is fine"" kind of mentality too.  Just, I've been medicated pretty much since puberty, and the breaks I've taken without medication have been brief.  I stopped taking Abilify because I connected the extreme fatigue I was experiencing to that medication (plus not having money for the refill), and it got me wondering if there are other components of my personality or health that I currently take for granted that may also be side effects of drugs.  It's possible that I don't really *know* what my baseline is anymore, right?  I'm not going as far as to convince myself that medication is causing my depression, but maybe my shit is more manageable now than it used to be, and I just don't know it?  Or like, if I stop taking medication long enough, and let myself reset, it will be more clear what my symptoms and needs are?  But then I also have a hormonal IUD, and I've heard people say that the Mirena has caused depression for them...so even if I stop taking my psych meds, what if my fucking birth control is making me depressed too?  How can I ever know what the hell is happening with me?

I dunno.  I'm diagnosed bipolar, and there's such a stereotype of bipolar folks just up and quitting their medication because they're fucking crazy people.  But really, mood stabilizers can make you feel terrible.  Antipsychotics can make you feel terrible.  And I'm just tired of not knowing whether I feel like garbage because of medication or because it's who I am.

And then, of course I'm concerned about being completely unable to survive without medication, and I'm worried that I can't even last without medication long enough to figure any of this out.  I just can't imagine being completely dependent on medication for the rest of my life though, especially when I have developed so much physically and mentally since I was initially medicated.  I was first medicated when I was 13, and I'm almost 29 now.  It feels important to figure this out, because I think I'll always wonder if I'm actually crazy or if I'm just dependent on meds.  It's just really daunting to not know what to expect.

I'm seeing a new psychiatrist tomorrow, out of convenience more than my interest in her--a friend has a new practice and was able to make me an appointment with their psych for tomorrow.  Hopefully she's helpful, but I kind of don't know what to say to her.  Writing this out has helped give me a sense of what to say, so thanks if you've read this.

I'd appreciate any insight on these sort of feelings that y'all might have.  I'm at a really low point currently, really not feeling capable of the self-care sort of maintenance things people recommend in place of medication, plus I work at night in the service industry so I'm just too fucking tired to take care of myself.  But I would like to hear other peoples' perspectives on these sort of feelings.  Thanks &lt;3",Depression
"I know what it's like... The good days never last. And to be honest, I'm afraid of letting myself be happy again. When I set back and analyze the past events of my life that have brought me to this exact moment in time, I can only tell myself that it's been a great and terrible existence.

I know what it's like to be a child, and with all of your being beg your mom to come home. Just an innocent and pure yearning for the safety of her presence that consumes every single fiber of your being. And sadly, I know what it's like for that to be ignored. 

I know what it's like to be a 12 year old, and have your love manipulated by an adult. She let her perverted desires overpower her human decency. She preyed on my naive want for love, and she abused her position of authority for sexual gains. I was in love, at the time though. I still love her 15 years later. But when the truth came out that a 40 year old was sexually involved with a 12 year old, she didn't care about my love anymore. She didn't reach out to me or anyone. She killed herself, and I was left feeling responsible. I felt as if I killed the person I was in love with. I would never see her again. Talk to her again. Laugh with her again. And it was all my fault. 

I know what it's like to just want to be loved so badly. To find people who say they love you, but they always decide you aren't worth their time. They say they are your friend, but when you end up needing them the most, nobody is there to wipe away your tears.

I know what it's like to be truly happy. To have someone and know you want them by your side forever. I know what it's like to hurt someone you would die for. To look in their eyes and see hurt and pain and know that you caused it. I know what it's like to wish with everything inside of you that you could go back in time to change it, or at least transfer that hurt on to yourself to relieve them from it.

I know what it's like to not want to keep living. To wake up every morning and know that you had the best thing in the world, and to know that you will never get it back. I know what it's like to wish for someone to realize how much they love you, and decide you are the most important thing in the world. I know what it's like to realize that you aren't really important to anyone. To be an embarrassment to the ones who claim to love you, when all you want is their approval and love.

I know what it's like to write 43 different letters to the people who touched your life the most, so when you're found they will hopefully have the answers to any questions they might have. I know what it's like to not be afraid of death, but to welcome it with open arms. I know what it's like to have almost no hope to hold on to. To know that things may get better, but it's only temporary.

"I don't believe in finding the right partner anymore I was in a relationship about three years ago that ruined my self esteem and my faith in love. Our relationship only lasted for half a year but I really liked her, and she liked me too. 
One day, I see her hanging out with another guy so I sent her a text asking her what she was doing and she said that she was alone, watching tv. I was dumb enough to believe her and this kept going, she would constantly lie about her not hanging out with some other guy and deep inside, I knew what she was doing, but the relationship went on because I couldn't stand to know the truth. Everytime she heard about me talking to another girl she would accuse me of cheating and threatened to break up with me. She always said that I didn't take our relationship seriously and that I shouldn't hang out with any other girls.
Later on she would then talk about her having mixed feelings about me, not knowing whether she liked me or not and it tormented me because I was afraid of losing her. 

I've avoided having relationships ever since she broke up with me. Every time a girl talks about commitment I just alienate them.

Sometimes in movies and TV shows (mostly cartoons) they will set a trap to capture something and sometimes when they do this they will leave a trail of candy or something similar to that, this a very good analogy for my life compared to other people's lives. Those who are happier, yet less spoiled than me are either unaware of the trail or still following the trail. Each small piece of candy is something that they want but don't need. But I on the other hand... I'm already at the end of the trail I didn't have to go towards the trap because I started at the trap, I was born here. There's nothing to to look forward to here, nothing to hope for. Those who are following the trail think that once they reach the end they will finally be happy, because they think that a tipped scale is better than a balanced one, while those who don't follow the trail are blissfully unaware.

But I'm not doing anything else, I've been stuck in a job hunt treadmill for the past six months, no option to move towards greener pastures as I'm caring for my sick mother in a small town. I've gained weight, I used to go for walks to clear my head and blow off steam but even those aren't helping anymore. It feels like my motivation and energy have been totally sapped. My girlfriend is back overseas, where I was until the anti-immigration wave hit Europe and put the kibosh on my visa renewal last year. I've had more and more down days since then. Sometimes waking up with a negative outlook, other times something triggers it. In the past I would roll with them, treat myself, or just try to ignore it and drink with friends. Those arent options anymore. 

These last two weeks especially have been hell, ear problems have cut out my hearing in one ear and replaced it with constant tinnitus and pain, awkward dinners with extended family, 20 year anniversary of my father's death, just found out my grandmother on his side passed away after we've been estranged for the last two decades, plus all the usual happy memories of the past compared to what I'm living now.  

Some days I'll wake up totally productive and ready to hammer out some more cover letters and pound the pavement, but those are rare now.     The only way I can sleep through the constant tinnitus and anxiety/insomnia is cannabis. I tried melatonin, it left me too groggy and confused in the morning, and despite my body's reluctance I've tried exercise, jogging and walks, still laying awake thinking about everything I could have done differently to get out of the state that I'm in, or worse, terrified of the future. If that makes any sense at all. I know cannabis is a crutch at this point, but considering my previous forays into self medicating with alcohol I'd rather be stoned and lazy than drunk and angry. 

I need to talk to my doctor but I don't know anything about the process. I mentioned that I've been feeling depressed and anxious a few visits ago but she just asked about suicidal thoughts and left it after her usual lecture about quitting smoking.  The small town I'm in has rampant drug problems so I can understand her wariness about prescribing anything. I just want to feel better again, get my sense of humor back, get out of this negativity whirlpool and stop feeling like a deflated balloon animal. 

Tl;Dr: how do you talk to your doctor about depression/anxiety?

"Don't know where to start Honestly, I don't know what to do anymore. Im currently seeing a therapist and trying to read books on how i can improve as well as working on my negative thought patterns but it feels like im not really making progress. Everyday just feels like one big blur with no moments of real joy or happiness. I dont know where to go from here. I just want to know that there is hope and that im not doomed to a life of suffering and misery. It feels like im searching for an answer which i dont know even exists. I just need someone to talk to. I hope that someome that reads this is willing to reach out. ",Depression
"Meds arent working anymore, my doctor left, and 8 months or more to see a new doctor. Now what? Last couple weeks Ive noticed a steady, and recently sharp the last two nights, decline in efficacy of my ?cocktail. Ive been through so many different medications to come to this mix, and Im only 8 months in

When I call to schedule an appointment with my doctor Im told she left the practice. They didnt contact me or get me another doctor. They had an undefined waiting list.

Ive contacted all of the out patient services in my area. The best available time for a new patient intake is 8mo. 

I of course cant just stop taking the meds since Im now physically dependent. My GP set me up with scripts for the next six months, but the meds arent working anymore.

"I am 18 and need some tips on how to stop overthinking situations that happen in my life to the worse possible outcome  

For the past couple of years now Ive always been overthinking things that happened in my life to the worst possible outcome when it didnt really happen.

Like 2 days ago to make the story short I bought a hoody in a roots store and completely forgot my debit card at the counter when I walked out the store. Luckily the cashier found me 2 mins afterwards leaving the store and returned the card to me. After I went home that day my head was going crazy, was thinking all over the place like what if someone took a photo of my card number and how dumb I was to do such a thing. Or how the card that was given back was a fake But in reality none of that happened as my bank statement was still clean after 2 days. I was probably to tired and my brain farted because I stayed at a mall for more then 5 hours that day

Also times where Im sick I start googling the syntomps. And overthink how my sickness is getting worse.

Finally Im currently overthinking about my wisdom tooth. My parents hinted about how they wanted to get my wisdom tooth removed and since then Ive been watching other peoples YouTube videos about there experience but also been overthinking the outcome for surgery since Ive never liked it much.

Thanks for any tips that are given as I really want to overcome this",Depression

"Depression has been bad the last few months, today I had an obscure out of body experience. Just to clarify I'm not taking any drugs, haven't drunk alcohol, and I'm not sleep deprived (I get most of what I miss at night in my naps).

I was doing my normal washing routine before I went to bed. I was in the bathroom with the mirror light on and I caught my reflection and just stared at myself. I don't recall even thinking anything for about 30 seconds. Then I couldn't recognise my own face and it felt like I was looking at something else and it was looking back straight at me. My eyes began to tear up and I snapped out off it when one rolled down my cheek.

I just headed straight to bed and came on Reddit to reply to a friend and then I posted this. ",Depression
Im not Gonna make it guys. I dont know what else to do.,Depression
"Feels like everyone is fucking with me. I'm kind of super lost and down right now, and am using almost all of my energy to just stay positive and move forward, but it really feels like everyone I talk to is just kind of fucking with me and mocking me. It's most likely just me telling myself that but it's exhausting having to reassure myself with almost everything everyone says to me. Even with people close to me my mind just jumps straight to a negative interpretation of almost any feedback. I know I need to talk to people to get out of this head space, but the constant feeling of being mocked is making it difficult and just causing me to withdraw further and overthink things even more, which is just making it worse. 

Does anyone have any advice or tips to get out of this loop? I'll do my best to interpret it as positive and helpful feedback. *forces smile*",Depression
"The strangest thing about moving past my depression and suicidal ideation is that all of a sudden I cry during movies and TV, even during happy parts that are particularly touching. I used to never cry at all and used to feel very little emotion bar anger at particularly nasty villains but I've noticed in the past year I've become very emotionally fragile when watching TV or movies with particularly emotional scenes.

This goes for movies I haven't seen in a while. For instance, I was just rewatching the Harry Potter movies over Christmas with my family and I cried during maybe 3 or 4 of them. Not blubbering, but I had to wipe my eyes as slyly as possible so my younger siblings who I was babysitting wouldn't notice. I don't remember feeling this affected by media as much in a very long time.

It's a strange phenomenon because I *feel* much stronger emotionally and *far* better at coping with things in my everyday life. It's a fantastic feeling to actually *have* feelings once more. Life used to seem so bleak and pointless.

Sidenote: For anyone wondering how I got passed my issues, I attended CBT with an excellent therapist to help deal with my crippling Social Anxiety Disorder. Also my physician swapped me to a California Rocket Fuel regimen (predominantly generics if the pharmacist had them in stock) from my previous Fluozetine/Prozac. This didn't seem to take initially but a heavier dosage appears to have done the trick with no side effects.

I used to be a good student and got into medical school off the back of this. Unfortunately my depression got the best of me when I became surrounded by high achievers and struggled to keep up. I had to take several years away from university during this period but I've since returned to my medical education and just received some excellent news in the form of Christmas Exam results.

There is light at the tunnel. Please don't give up. I was in touch with euthanasia services at my lowest point after several failed attempts on my life (saved through the heroic actions of others). Life can be a wonderful place if you get the help you need to get you past your darkest hours.

Happy New Year.",Depression
"Am I unfixable? I need some advice.  

This is my first time posting something like this to the internet but this platform seems suitable. *Please skip to the bold text if you don't need the background.*

I'm 19 years of age from the UK, currently undergoing treatment for anxiety and depression and have done for the past three years. For the first two years, I was only able to see a child psychiatrist as I was not yet 18, and also a CBT therapist which I found completely unhelpful apart from as someone to talk to about problems. During the period as a child, I was trialled on Prozac, to which I had a bad reaction and hence stopped. I was then given 25mg Quetiapine to take nightly and undertook the previously mentioned CBT.

In early 2017 after a year of nothing working, and frustration, I foolishly began experimenting with illicitly obtained substances to curb the feelings of panic, loneliness and hopelessness. I sporadically used Xanax 1-2mg and Diazepam 10mg to treat my anxiety without knowledge of my Dr. Knowing full well the risks of developing a benzodiazepine dependency, I stopped this later in the year, progressing onto experimenting with opiates (DHC) and later smoking heroin into 2018 and intermittently during this year. I know this was stupid, but I gained some short term relief, and the withdrawals experienced after cessation of the drug even after only taking it for a short time has been enough to discourage me from illicit self medication in future.

More importantly, in early 2018 I began to see an adult psychiatrist who, to my satisfaction, was more aggressive regarding treatment. Throughout the year I tried the following for depression: Venlafaxine, Vortioxetine, L-Methylfolate

and the following for anxiety: Pregabalin, Baclofen, Propanolol. All these either didn't work at all or had bad side effects. I was gene tested which found out that I was likely to have severe side effects to all SSRIs (explaining previous reaction to Prozac). A brief stint on Naltrexone after the opiate problem worsened my anhedonia and sense of taste/fun, which has now partially restored.

**My current medication regimen is as follows (daily):**

**Modafinil 200mg, Bupropion 150mg, Clomipramine 150mg, Imipramine 50mg, Levothyroxine 50mg, Quetiapine 25mg (at night to aid sleep), Clonazepam 1mg (as needed).**

*Initial side effects such as dry mouth, depression worsening, tremor have subsided substantially and my only current side effect of all this is maybe some tiredness, and a consistently raised heart rate by the TCAs (resting 95bpm as opposed to 60-70bpm beforehand)*

I am fully aware that my current regimen has helped cull a lot of my suicidal thoughts which were at the forefront of my mind, and have slightly dulled some of my more persistent depressive thoughts. However, I still have persistent anxiety, boredom, lack of passion, and inability to be comfortable in my own company. I tried higher doses of Clomipramine and Imipramine to no avail, and 300mg Bupropion gave me jitterish anxiety and constant 120bpm heart rate.

However, I am currently in my first year at university. I am immensely stressed, still with anxiety that stops me from eating, sleeping and studying as I should be often. I have an intense fear of being alone and being unsuccessful all whilst feeling like I am failing my degree in Engineering where I feel totally overwhelmed and inadequate. The only positive in my life at the moment is my amazing girlfriend on my uni course, without whom I couldn't have coped the past few months, but I'm literally 100% dependent on her for my stability at the moment which is a dangerous position to be in, relying on external factors to stay stable. She only knows part of the story but she has some idea.

Due to the intensity of the university course, I had to cease my sporting activity (rowing) as the level of commitment required at university would be unsustainable with my depression-related fatigue and my degree. I can't tolerate my own company as all I ever do is ruminate about the future, what is the point in life, nobody likes me, I'm a failure.

My Doctor has referred me to try another course of CBT that I hope works this time and is considering adding an antipsychotic such as Olanzipine to work on dopamine. I am very forthright and have tried my upmost to fill my time, find things to do, but I just get overwhelming anxiety at times and I can't keep regularly using Clonazepam as a solution. Likewise, I have no passions or interests, I'm on my course because it related to my school studies and seemed like the best option. I've tried to give myself a routine, things to do, but I just can't do that when I'm at home over the eternal Christmas holidays.

When I am distracted by my girlfriend or friends (company) I am fine, but put me in my own company for more than a short period then I just feel the pain of being alone, start worrying about things from exams to peoples' health to things about the future. My family think they are being supportive but really they tell me that I am not helping myself, I have to 'change how I think' and 'medication will never fix you'. I know my anxious thoughts are irrational, but I can't stop the physical anxious sensations that come with it. Likewise, I feel like the Modafinil and maybe the thyroxine is only just getting me through the day and I'm always tired for no apparent reason. I couldn't function without it.

**I apologize for the long post, I was just wondering if anybody out there could shed some light on any other options I could go down. I thought going to uni would be part of my cure but it ends up that it's just a distraction from the underlying problem that I have no real passion or interest for anything and I just worry about things. Could the anti-psychotic addition help or is there anything else I could try from a pharmacological point of view, or otherwise? I'm really starting to lose faith that I will ever feel like a normal person. I want to \*want\* things again, I want to have things I enjoy, hobbies and passions. It's not for a lack of trying things but I just feel like I'm losing the battle. If I can clear anything up or clarify anything please do ask.. thank you!**",Depression
"What do I do? My best friend and I had a fight almost 3 weeks ago. She hasn't spoken to me since. My anxiety and depression are worse than they've been maybe ever (I attempted to take my life the 30th but failed) and I need to talk to her.

"Just a void Hi, first time posting here. Im somewhat new to reddit and just recently saw the posts here. I wanted to talk about something that I continue to struggle with everyday and can not seem to find help. 

I am just a void. I do not really feel anything. I feel like an empty person. I dont feel sad or depressed, i just dont feel anything else. If I could draw it I would draw the outline of a body and draw and a circle in the middle of my body. A hole, a void that has engulfed me in it. I fall asleep all the time now, literally in any situation. It doesnt matter how much sleep I have or how little I have. I have lost interest in almost all of my favorite things.  It started in the summer of 2018 and has only gotten worse. I had a breakdown in school, the first time I had felt real sadness, in September. My family sought out help yet the therapy didnt work. My shrink said I had signs of disassociation yet never diagnosed me. We stopped going as it got expensive. 

I dont know what to do and to be honest I dont even know where to begin to get better. ",Depression

"New job with depression Background on me, yes I am annoyed with myself too. Im 25 and Ive been living at home since I graduated college. After graduating and applying to medical school and not getting in, I had a huge decline in my mental health. I was always kind of an anxious and depressed person, but not to the extreme that I became a couple years ago. I couldnt even get myself up off the couch many days, went through a long period of unemployment and accumulated a lot of debt on my credit cards. 
I worked a hodgepodge of jobs for several years, my last one was mostly an outdoor job at a company near by that I liked a lot at first because of the easy commute and the flexibility within the job. I made friends there and I actually felt happy, although still anxious, for a little bit. Then something happened and I lost two dear dogs of mine within several months of each other and I tore my ACL and meniscus while skiing, so I was sedentary and depressed for a long time. Watching tv, eating junk food, and crying was what I did with most of my time, and seeing my therapist once a week. 
What I love most on earth is animals. I have chickens and dogs and cats at home who I love dearly. I adopted a new 8 month old puppy a couple months ago and he is the love of my life. We also foster dogs and I love helping them, it makes me feel a little bit better when I get sad about the other dogs who died. 
Recently, I heard about a job opening from an old professor at a prestigious biotech company in the city that I live sort of near. I applied, got the interview (which was 5 hours long, included multiple math tests and group interviews and was very stressful). I cried and stressed about this interview for the few days I had to prepare while I studied after work. I got sick and got canker sores in my mouth from the stress of preparing. To my surprise, they hired me on the spot and offered to pay me way more than I imagined with fantastic benefits and growth opportunities. I should be elated right? Im not. Im depressed and scared. 
I see it as the end of my freedom. Less time to spend with my dog, 2+ hours of commuting on public transportation per day, a high stakes stressful job where it actually matters if I do work, and absolutely no time off for 6 months. Honestly, Im terrified im not mentally stable enough to hold this down. Its the beginning of a career with lots of growth opportunities and what I thought I always wanted. Apparently really all I want is to be a bum at home and rewatch the great British baking show on repeat while eating cookies and snuggling with my dog. 

Mostly I just wanted to vent. I wonder why Im not happy about this, but Ive been been happy with any job guess. 
What do I do? Get back on SSRIs and hope it helps me hold down this job? My therapist is completely booked I cant see him before I start next week. ",Depression

"Going to a rehab clinic soon for 3 months... Im sorry for this long post!

Im a 20 year old male going to a rehab clinic soon, mainly for my depression but also for a cannabis addiction. I signed myself up for it because I really need this. I came to this decision because of how bad my depression got. From raging at all my friends and losing them as a result of it to a suicide attempt, from breaking all my personal belongings to losing my job. 

I have a twin brother whos addicted to alcohol for 4 years and cocaine for 3 years now. Its killing my parents and for years my mom has been in tears every day. For a long while my brother would come home late, intoxicated and hostile towards our parents. He would threaten us with a knife, call us all sorts of stuff and fight with my dad and I, which is why the police often had to show up at our house to take him with them. 

Im angry at him but have to be chill with him because my parents simply want peace in our home, which is very understandable. Instead of being angry at him I used good friends as my outlet by raging at them and even threatened to beat up one of my friends her friend because he told me to chill when I was raging at her. I truly do regret it and miss her as she had always been good for me and cheered me up when I was sad, I tried apologizing in a text which she didnt accept as I should have made my apology in person. Thats been a little while now and I hope to be able to make it up to her when I get out of rehab. 

Anyway... all my friends that I have left now smoke weed every day and that really is all we do but they have been there for me when I needed them most. Im afraid I will lose them too when Im out of rehab because theres no need to hangout with them when I wont be smoking weed. Im afraid of losing my grandparents while Im gone as their health is getting worse rapidly now, if that happens I likely wont know till Im out of rehab, but most important I will miss their funeral. 

Ive been waiting for rehab for 2 months now, I had and have nothing to do because I broke my computer which I used to produce music with and have no money to pay for the gym I once used to go to. I know I could have easily been doing some volunteer work but my feelings keep my from doing so. 

Im excited for rehab, Ill make my parents and family proud of me. Although the wait is difficult because of all my feelings and boredom.

"Just another depressed boy ready for it to be over. Laying in bed for hours in the middle of the day like I've done everyday for months now. Lately the loneliness comes in waves of burning electric pressure emanating from my chest. It hurts but also feels kind of good.

No job, can't pay rent, I barely eat, lost 60lbs down to 120lbs, in the last 4 months, not anorexic on purpose but only eating around 400 Cal a day for months now, just not interested in eating or life in general. I hate myself to the core and have zero self-esteem.
