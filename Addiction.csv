Description,Mental State
"I'm sorry about this post. It's gonna be a whole lot of hand wringing and mental masturbation. But I never seem to be able to process this in a meaningful way - and it makes attending NA and AA meetings a real pain. I don't seem to have the same kind of sickness that everyone else is describing - I'm having trouble relating to anyone at all there. I don't know what it's like for normal functional people, nor do I know what it's like for people who taste 1% beer and come to next month in jail after charging a rhino to a military convoy dressed in wehrmact univorm. Instead of this all-encompassing disease people speak of in groups it's like a slight poly-addiction as parts of the maladaptive patterns I've learned due to ADHD - and the cravings themselves are way lessened due to starting on strattera.

At the same time I've now, for the upteenth time, decided to be sober after binge-drinking all of my money away once again - BUT I can ween off unaided and I did not really need to do all that, there were factors in play. On a scale from one to then how much addict's horseshit was condenced in that last paragraph in your opinion? I'm self aware to a point, but my problem is it never seems to be enough. I will go on groups and feel like an impostor the whole time, go home feeling miserable and alone, and eventually relapse. This time I actually want it to stick, I am indepted, uneducated tool who just turned 27 - and it seems like I need to get my life in order now.",Addiction
"Been getting super high off high amounts of thc edibles and stuff every single day. I started off only doing it weekends but I just kept doing it. Today would be my first day not getting high?cause I started popping random pills, and yesterday I drank a bottle of cough syrup just to get High. It?s like I crave being high. And I just feel so annoyed and I don?t really care what others think of me?I?m tired of the bs. Irritation fume",Addiction
"My brothers been shooting heroin/meth for the past 5 years, ran away to cali 3 years ago. My childhood best friend overdosed on fentanyl in October. My dad who has been on meth for as long as I can remember finally got clean in January because he got covid and basically detoxed. I?ve always been a social drinker but lately I?ve been drinking around 2 bottles of wine a night. I feel like I?m drowning & and the only way I?m happy is when I?m buzzed even though I know what road I?m heading down. My family?s health declined severely through my brothers addiction on top of my dads own drug problems. My grandma had a stroke in November and my mom has become her primary caretaker. Im in graduate school right now & trying to help as much as I can, but I?m angry that my brother left me to do this on my own. On top of that, I feel guilty for being angry. I don?t even know if this post belongs here, pls delete if not.",Addiction
"I rlly need an opinion cuz idk bout this stuff i don?t rlly drugs. Idk if this is normal and im just overreacting but his drug habits does make me worried. I knew he drank and smoked weed here and there like every teen/YA but i never blinked an eye.

My bf gets defensive when i ask why he does what he does. I mean he said he quit vapes so i thought nun of his habits until he told me the stuff he does. Like he told me he has drank alcohol and drove so i told him to stop (he told me he?ll try not to but no promise. & it?s ok to do a little cuz he has a high tolerance). I know he did Oxy & percs but i thought he was jokin cuz he told me took an Oxy then when i said huh he said he jokin but he didn?t seem high so yk i brushed it off but we were otp.

He did shrooms recently and had a bad trip he told me after it happen tho i didn?t have any clue he even doing it?! He also told me he called his close friends but he didn?t tell/call me which hurt me on top of the fact he said he only told me cuz i asked not bc he wanted to. He planned to do tabs saturday with names he never said to me before but that plan fell thru.

Ik he did a favor for his plug and got drugs on sunday cuz he told me & i checked his location he was out but idk what his plug sells.

On the same day later we got into a spat when he told me he was smoking and stuff with his friends and i told him how i felt concerned. He said to me over text & i quote directly from text

?i have right to be secretive for my privacy and for my security.?

?i was doing drugs before i met u and will be doing drugs forever. i was depressed about shit before i met u and will continue to be until some shit in my life gets better.?

?ik what drugs can do to me and i am smart enough to not get in positions where drugs can hurt me?

idk what to think anymore like ik he?s depressed and stuff and i try to be there for him. I mean i don?t think he?s ever been high around me but maybe that?s cause he knows i get upset or maybe i?m to naive to notice cuz i don?t notice when ppl are. Like I mean is this like a red flag or am i just overreacting??????

Also he does have a family history of substance abuse.

TL:DR my bf drinks , smokes weed , has done precs & oxy , and has done shrooms. (I think he only drinks at parties and he does smoke a bit but idk how often does it on a givin week & have no clue how often he does pills.) And gets defensive bout his drug use when i bring it up. Does he have a problem?",Addiction
"Ive smoked weed since 8th grade in middle school and have been hooked since. Im proud to say I haven?t smoked in over 10 days (cant remember last hit) and honestly I don?t wanna remember my last hit because I want it out of my life forever. Ever since I?ve smoked I?ve been (Lazy, unproductive, negative, sleeping issues, and digestion problems) I finally plan on going to trucking school and passing drug tests when I get my CDL so I can finally have a good future!

" don?t care how much I post on this I just don?t have anyone to talk too. As someone who suffers from depression and anxiety I feel like it?s coming all back even though I?m on antidepressants. I?ve also been getting high everyday, but I have nothing today?wel I could do cough syrup but I don?t know yet. I?m having such a shitty day and nothing even happen it?s all me feeling like shit. I literally am being a bitch. I just told one of my friends that their friend that died was a dumbass. Now I feel like a jackass. And I?ve been being a bitch all day.

"I'm not one to really seek out support for my problems, so this is really weird for me, and I don't even know if this is the right group I just need to know someone else in the world knows what I'm going through right now. A year ago I used to wake up, take 750 mg of phenibut and 2 g's of kratom. I'd chase them down with a few beers and smoke some weed. After I got a good buzz going I'd take some oxy and klonopin, chase down with more beer. Right before it was time to work do a couple lines of coke then pop my happy ass into work. That was my daily schedule for almost a year, up until last year I decided to quit, because I got an amazing girlfriend, who I saw myself spending the rest of my life with. We started living together, things were going good, then 8 months in she started talking to and flirting with another guy, doing who knows what else behind my back, saying I changed, and I'm not the same person I was when we started dating. Now I'm having a really shitty crisis where I'm feeling like the drugs made me who I was, made me into somebody who people liked, and I'm having serious thoughts of going back. I don't want to go back but life feels so empty now and I just want to feel normal again. I just wanted to get that out there into the open world of the internet. ",Addiction
"I really want and need to find a support system to finally get clean... My DOC is meth and im 3 months clean off fent laced heroin. I could only get clean from H by starting the suboxone program in my town. it saved my life and is a miracle. they knew i still used meth but made a deal to get me off within a couple months once im stable off heroin.

well... there amazing people and so kind theyre giving me so much slack. But i was supposed to piss clean tomorrow and i relapsed 2 days ago after 4 days sober (the longest ive had in a year). i let them know imediatly and the response wasnt great obviously. If i cant pee clean in 1 week theyll most likely kick me out. meaning suboxone withdrawals and inevitable relapse on heroin. im not near ready and havent done much work on the route casue of my use. Even those 4 days felt great for my body though. and when i relapsed ive felt disgusting ever since. this stuff is pure poison",Addiction
I?ve been doing a lot of Xanax and Valium lately like a lot and I can?t stop? I?m also on a shit ton of opiates a lot and smoke weed basicly 24/7. I?ve been on this shit for a long time and I really wanna stop but I can?t no matter how hard I try? my brother died from herion and you?d think that would be enough to scare me off of drugs forever but no it jus made me do them more cuz I want to escape. I?m only 16 and I?ve overdosed 2 times. I wanna have a good life but I can?t seem to leave the drugs behind.,Addiction
"What started with alcohol, has been a decade of one substance after the other. I need this for energy, or I need this for depression. My kids have seen me measure my kratom and phenibut for years and I always said it was for energy or a supplement for my protein shakes. Oooooooookay.

On substances im not an introvert anymore, im not shy and insecure and anxious. Im outgoing and talkative and creative. All of these things that make me an even better mother (I tell myself) because I've never been clean longer than a couple weeks off of EVERYTHING for 8 years to even know.

I remember my creativity when my kids were 1,2,3...

I know I don't need drugs to be that person. But I can never make it through withdrawal/ paws and be a good enough mother, so I go back or I find another ""legal"" drug. (No I have 0 help to go to treatment. None.) I've been ""sick"" SO MANY TIMES for a week or 2 on end when they've had to basically fend for themselves. That can't happen again. Ever.

This last habit cost me $20k. I panic about paying lunch money at their school but I can go pay $50 a pop for ""energy and motivation""?!?

As I popped my last handful of pills which I thought was discreet, my 8 year old in the backseat of the car coloring... ""mommy why are you taking so many pills? You don't need those mommy."" She's right.

I stopped drinking a 5th of vodka a day 5 or so years ago after I had to drink(unknowingly, or so I THOUGHT!) To be social at my kids sports game. Drove home trashed, they called the only person they knew hysterical trying to give them directions of where we were. Police came because I was in someone's front lawn - I fought them and three other people infront of my kids - woke up the next morning in my bed clueless.

I could have lost them all. Just like that. They all remember that. My 8 year old doesn't even like me to drink wine or beer, tells me I don't need it. She knows I act differently, even though in my mind I need it to get things done etc.

I could be such a better mother. 50 hour work weeks, 3 kids, school, sports, home - HOW do I convince myself I can be amazing without all of this shit thats probably killing me?! I tell myself everyday & I already know I dont need this shit and I need to stop for my kids - but its like I HAVE to always be on SOMETHING?!",Addiction
"Title is pretty self explanatory. I only discovered a few hours ago, been sworn to secrecy by my mother. He?s been on it for the past 2 years and I didn?t even fucking notice the difference, I feel awful for not realising but I feel like I don?t even know him anymore. From what my mother has told me, he?s been clean for a few days and is staying home, he wants to try get clean at home before committing to something like rehab (I don?t know how this all works I?m sorry). I want to help him, spend time with him but every time i even look at him I can?t help but burst into tears. I don?t want to somehow turn him into a villain in my eyes because I know he isn?t, I love my Father so much and I want to do everything I possibly can for him, but i seriously don?t know what to do.

I?m sorry if it sounds like i?m completely rambling but i need advice on how to help my father please.",Addiction
"I?ve had the prescription for about 4 years, but for the past year I started gradually taking more and more. I?m able to get away with it for the time being because I can have it prescribed by my therapist and also my doctor. Usually I think at least in my country it would raise a red flag since i go through the pills about 5 times faster than if I were taking them as prescribed.

My misuse has also not gone unnoticed. My parents think I am doing drugs and they are not wrong but they don?t know it?s a prescription. Anyway what?s the difference if it?s legal or not? Coworkers also comment that I look like I live a hard life and that?s true because I barely sleep. For the past 5 months or so I am going to work with about 2-4 hours of sleep each night.

If it weren?t for old photos I was looking at today I would by even notice the change. Anyways as of tomorrow I am going to try and take them as prescribed or at least start to take less",Addiction
"I don't know how to talk around it so I'll just say it, I'm a sex addict, I've been holding off on any impulse for three weeks plus a day it's going pretty well, and I've got nobody but my girlfriend to thank for that. Well, she's been getting a bit more intimate lately, and you could cut the tension between us with a knife, and I'm honestly not sure if I should go for it

It's a nice and intimate moment between two people who have a decent trust between them, but everytime my mind wanders towards the subject of sex, I only think of it in the vein of ""aw, nice, I'm gonna get a fix"", and I feel liks that isn't the right way to go into it

I'd say it's like a food addiction, you're eating healthy, but then your best friend gets a promotion and the celebration calls for a pizza party. It wouldn't hurt to indulge, but it could be a gateway back to the problem",Addiction
"So I decided to tamper with a-pihp several weeks ago. It went rather disastrous but I was able to get my footing back on the right track. Fast forward a month of 2 and I decided I would try a-php to see what the hype was all about.

"I'm so utterly screwed. The problem is that I don't want to get better, because I just enjoy Netflix so much (in a very guilt ridden way.) Everything else seems so boring in comparison to Netflix shows. Core areas of my life such as my sleep and work are suffering because of this very severe addiction. I think I'm more addicted to Netflix then I could possibly be to any drug. I just sit there clicking next episode over and over again and 6 hours go by. And I hate myself for it. Every night I say I'm going to stop, every time I go out of the house I say I'm going to stop, and then I come back inside and watch the show.",Addiction
"i didn?t realize mrn numbers allow other docs pharmacies and physicians to see diagnosis. i work in a sector and will be absolutely scrutinized or denied employment in pre physical exams if this pops up. because rehab brainwashed me that i was an addict and alcoholic (i ran aa instead of na) i told them i was an alcoholic and they wrote it down despite not asking about my drinking history. they just relied on my self diagnosis and didn?t ask much about how much i used only the length of time. i told them i was addicted to ambien and xanax which actually wasn?t true. i was dependent on them, and only abused them aka not take them as prescribed when i tried to get clean and use these as comfort meds getting off fentanyl which was a different beast. i was never an irresponsible drinker or a heavy one as i hated hangovers and thought it was a shitty drug overall.

many might disagree but my honest past drug resume is i never fall into addiction with any other substance except oxycodone.

when i had almost a year sober a small relapse of sniffing .5 mg of xanax i found in my room sent me to hating myself for screwing up, in reality this unhealthy view of my self and dishonest brainwashing by rehab set me up to fail if i used any substance, i guess it?s why it?s such a profitable business.

case point i never got opiates from the doc and self medicated after a traumatic car accident. i was given ambien and xanax which i used responsibly for almost two years and was tapered off no problem. it became an issue once opiates came into play and a poly substance depdence formed, and i was battling my opiate wd by abusing those meds and also becoming dependent but not addicted to them if that makes sense. only oxycodone i truley believe is my addiction.

id much rather not deal with the stigmatization, pain in the ass judgement and explanations in the future having ?sedative use disorder, hypnotic drug use disorder and opiate use disorder on my medical record. this sets me up for failure for pre employment physicals, or a situation where i have an accident at work and they have accesss to my records because i work in this sector. is it possible to remove this info i disclosed? at my rehab after all was said to 100% truth i only had been diagnosed as a opiate addict, not a poly substance addict like how i came off across. i didn?t realize doctors were so miseducated on addiction and told them i suffer from alcoholism and they listed that as on my record as well when i was always a responsible drinker. is there any way for them to erase the info i disclosed or remove the diagnosis ? id much rather lost allergic to opiates then have these diagnosis on my record for how annoying it makes to see doctors",Addiction
I got addicted to Monster and Nos about two years ago when I worked the night shift for FedEx ground because it would keep me awake and able to push through loading so much shit all the time. I quit working there after a year but I've continued on drinking 2 or 3 cans a day sometimes 4 when I'm depressed. Every time I try to quit I get extremely painful headaches and a raw sensation in my gut that quickly goes away when I start drinking again. I've tried tapering off but when I drink even one I get immense cravings for another and the cycle continues. I can feel my health declining and my teeth feel weaker and weaker every day. Was wondering if anybody has had experience with this and could offer a non-typical solution that actually works.,Addiction

"Age 39, smoker of 24 years. I have quit for months and years along the way. I have always had a massive association between alcohol and cigarettes. My undoing for smoking is ALWAYS when I get drunk, cos a)the mental association with alcohol just amplifies the craving b)the wall of self-discipline is weakened by alcohol and c)I'm surrounded by smokers offering me one. I haven't had a drink for 6 weeks nor any nicotine for 5 days, but I'm going to a function this weekend. I can totally see myself getting drunk and smoking AGAIN. Any helpful strategies?",Addiction
"Before I start I just want to say there is no offense to the ones in the twelve step program, AA, or decide to do abstinence. I do think moderation is possible for people like me who have been diagnosed with AUD. I tried everything and none of it worked. I think the ideal of full on abstinence for the rest of my life and starting all over to day 1 stressed me out. I've managed to successfully drink once a week or every two weeks I'll go and drink. Yes I do binge drink when I do, but I was thinking about trying naltrexone when I do. I've been doing this for a year a now and it helps me stay sober. I'm tired of feeling guilt about it though because I don't want to get judged by peers. Has this moderation thing worked for anyone for long periods or not? Please tell me your experiences.",Addiction

"It seems like im addicted to everything. Like I trade habits for new ones or that I circle back to old habits when the new ones cycle out. I date women who treat me like shit. When it finally breaks me, I trade that in for drugs, when I quit drugs, I move onto food, then back to a relationship, then to alcohol. Sometimes the addictions overlap. But idk where to go. Addiction counseling here is a joke. There are no peer support counseling groups. Im an opportunist addict.",Addiction
"Is there a test out there that can be used for a person that is trying to stop smoking, but is utilizing nicotine aids like patches, gum, lozenges, or whatever else is out there? So I'd imagine it would be testing for something other than nicotine since it would need to differentiate the aids from tobacco smoke.

I tried searching and couldn't find anything....hoping someone has some experience and can give me a quick and definitive answer.",Addiction
"I?m 23. I have dealt with sexual abuse and cheating for many years. I didn?t really rely on substances to help me get past any of it. I tried to kill myself and when I was discovered, my parents helped me go to therapy. Discovered I have clinical depression, anxiety, and OCD. My first experience with sexual assault was the trigger for all my borderline mental issues to come to their full glory. This all happened when I was 14 and I had kind of started becoming better around 19. I just smoked cigarettes first. But then I went to postgrad at 22 and things went downhill from there. All my issues just came back and became 10 times worse. Therapy didn?t seem to be helping because my old therapist moved aboard and I didn?t have the strength to find another. Even the ones he recommended weren?t good enough. So I started weed, hash, and alcohol. It?s been about 7-8 months now but I can?t find strength without at least one of the three. I have to be drunk or high to get through my awake hours and to put me to sleep. I also smoke excessively. A pack a day. It feels so much like an onset and I hate it. But I also don?t know what to do to help myself get through each day. I?m absolutely confused and tired. Cannabis and alcohol are my only solace.",Addiction
"Hear me out please, this is a bit crazy. So every night, right after my bf goes to work, I turn my lights off ( around 1 am, bf works 3rd shift), I hear a couple of people running the hallways. Shortly after, a terrible nauseating smell starts seeping through my apt door, vents in the bedroom, and living room. It keeps waking me up during the night. Right before 8:30 am when bf comes back home and landlord usually gets in his office, smell's completely gone. This has been going on for several months now. Told landlord, he came up here in the morning, and told me no smell of any sort, it could be food. I've been trying very hard to see who those people are, but it's pointless. No talking whatsoever, not a peep. I stand by the door sometimes for an hour just to see who they're and where they come from, the minute I step into my bathroom, I hear them running while I am in there. Landlord told me not to call cops, they have better things to do.",Addiction
"My addiction is not as severe as some others on here. I have been drinking 2-3 energydrinks a day since i was about 14. Maybe not 2-3 everyday, but 98% of the year. Anyway, its safe to say i have been addicted for the last 5 years. I have spent a lot of money on energydrinks, and this one of the first times i have seriously tried to stop. I stopped for about 15 days before, but that was just for a bet. Now i want to stop for real. I am about two weeks in, the store closes in an hour and i want to go down there and buy three and drink them all.

"I was wondering if anyone knew of a good alternative rehab center. I once saw someone mention a place that I think was in Mexico, and they use pychadelic drugs to help you through the withdrawal. I looked it up and it sounded promising. Supposedly after just one night of using the psychedelic you?re good to go? Anyways, I can?t find it now on Google. Also I was looking at this rapid detox here in the states where they use anesthesia and use a drug to rapidly detox you while you?re under. Anyone tried that? I can?t do another traditional rehab. It just doesn?t work for me and I don?t want to use subs again. Anyone who could point me in the right direction? ",Addiction

But I?ve done horrible things. Like. Horrible. Anyways, my question is has anyone else experienced someone lashing out in anger post addiction?

I got him on the program which he quit two weeks later ( the clinic was absolutely dicking us both around & is still doing it to me so I kinda don't blame him ) but I explained you need to find another clinic ASAP.

Our training teaches us to consider a broad array of options such as harm reduction, alternative peer support groups like Recovery Dharma, etc. We definitely encourage people to attend some type of outside group simply for the connection but even that isn't a mandate; every individual js different and will have different needs. I'm a therapist as part of a very flexible IOP program with emphasis on harm reduction and motivat8onal interviewing so I feel lucky. Hopefully clients are doing their homework beforehand to see if a program subscribes exclusively to 12-step philosophy or not

Feel free to share your thoughts. This is nit something I'd share with my clients and I generally encourage them to go to AA/NA and think it works well for the majority of them. I'm just l criticizing a black and white view, not 12-step itself.",Addiction
"Y?all. I?m bipolar 2, have GAD, social anxiety & recently added PTSD to the list due to waking up to my boyfriend dead after fetanyl overdose. I?ve been struggling with smoking weed. I know that doesn?t sound like much, but I?m the kind of person to not control how much I smoke. I went to rehab for 11days & it helped up until my boyfriends passing.

"I want to preface by saying I tried posting in /suboxone but my posts won't go through.

Is it possible for someone to take 8mg of subs and also use H the same day? I know someone close who is recovering and on a suboxone program but was worried that they could potentially be using at the same time. If they take 8mg at the same time and everyday there is no way they can use h without noticeable symptoms right?",Addiction
"My 24yo nephew is going through an intense withdrawal. He was hospitalised from Thursday until yesterday Saturday. Yesterday was the first time he opened his eyes. Today is the first time he was able to eat on his own. I am looking after him along with another nephew of mine. I noticed the smallest of sounds would trigger him so the 2 of us looking after him don't talk inside the room but rather send each other messages over the phone. For those who went through withdrawal that was intense, did you find that music in the background helped? Or did you prefer complete silence?

"I'm just really lost and really scared. I'm a 24yo Female who has been using weed on and off since two years. But the last one month has been really bad on me. I found myself lighting up 3-4Js every single day. When,I used to get high that high would not be enough for me and I would want to get more high. Bong hits and Js. I used to smoke up a J and then not find the high sufficiently enough so I would take bong hits. I found myself doing this every other day and then everyday. I told myself,I don't have a problem. But off late I have gotten really bad trips where I wanted to try harder drugs like LSD. I realized I was getting harder and harder into it and also dragging my partner into it. They don't smoke as often but as I used to smoke up in the house every day they would get really contact high. And then they would eventually smoke up too. They are younger to me. 21. And that scared me and made me stop. I found myself going down this really dark path and constantly had existential questions of life and death and if anything matters and how the world is such a unfair place. How the world is filled with messed up horrible people.

I have cried several times after being high about my looks,my weight,my hair and my career. Honestly,I'm not over weight ,I do have extra 5kgs than I should but I have always faced body dysmorphia. I used to get high,eat a hell lot and then feel guilty about it so I used to puke it out. My weight issues have been with me since I was a teen and I'm really trying to get off it.

5 days back,I flushed out the weed I had. My partner and I decided to do that together.

I have been feeling really depressed since then. I have this really bad dips where I just want to cry and find myself to be a loser. I feel anxious and stressed when I think about my career and I do find myself wanting to smoke up a J but I am stopping myself.

I also feel really disconnected with my body. I feel like I'm watching a movie. It's exactly the way I used to feel when I was high. I have felt several times when I was high that this is the level of consciousness and awareness I want all the time and not the level of consciousness I have when I'm sober.

I don't know what's going on. But I'm really low and I don't have the energy. I'm trying to research and which is why I ended up writing this all down here. Please help me with any advice possible. I don't want to go down a dark path and die.",Addiction
"I have been a weekend addict for 10 years and a daily pot addict. I?m mostly hooked to alcohol, speed or cocaine and binge smoking over the weekend. The weekdays then pass by with me super exhausted, unable to manage my life yet being highly functional. I think I was an addict way before these 10 years though. My primary attachment figure, for example, was often my computer when I was young due to emotional neglect.

My husband is as much an addict as me, but less of a weekend addict and more of a heavy pot smoker. It is safe to say though that I don?t have many sober people around me.

"Hey guys, just wondering if any of you have previously overcome a nicotine addiction and what ways you went about it. Over the past year or so I have picked up a nicotine addiction through vaping (disposable vapes). It originally started because everyone else had them when I would go out and I?d do it too, but has since evolved to the point where I always have one with me. The strange thing is when I go away for work (usually around a week at a time) I don?t take one with me and don?t crave them at all while I?m away, but as soon as I?m home and can easily go buy one from the nearest ezymart/tobacconist I crave it badly.

"My gf is taking pills, we have a 6 month old son.

She?s been in the hospital twice when she was younger for pill issues. Weve been really happy for awhile and our boy is beyond a blessing.

Last Thursday, I came home to her sleeping with our son. Her mom came over because she felt something was off, which is was. We found vodka glass next to her, a bunch of vodka cans in the recycling bin and she was absolutely passed out. She also dropped 4 calazoblam(sp) out of her pocket the day before(she?s had problems with those before).

Sure enough she went insane, eyes bloodshot . Slurred speech. Called the cops saying I stole our son(I didn?t I took him away to my parents and her mom was with me) to calm her down. Spoke absolute insanity nonsense and ran outside with no shoes on screaming. Making zero sense

"i am a poly addict with schizophrenia. i went through a period of my life where the only thing that mattered to me in the world was drugs. one of my best friends died when we were 19, because of cystic fibrosis. i am almost 22 now. i just couldnt handle it. i was first addicted to benzos at 16, because i got a xanax prescription from my psychiatrist due to an ""anxiety disorder"" (which turned out to be the prodromal phase of my schizophrenia, and it turns out i needed antipsychotics and NOT benzos.). soon enough i was doing 10mg xanax every day, sometimes 15. it was very easy for me to keep em coming so i kept doing them. i became terrified of this and didnt talk to anyone about it and i cold turkeyed soon after. i had a seizure, had to go to the hospital and admit to benzo use. i was put on a taper program. havent touched benzos since, aside from 3 relapses that i dont feel very good about, but it is what it is.

when my friend died, i crawled into the liquor bottle and clung to it HARD. i would drink a bottle and a half of vodka every day. i would vomit in my sleep and didnt have the mental fortitude to clean up, so i would sleep in my own vomit for hours. it thought THAT was rock bottom. i was wrong. a very concerned professor of mine made me an appointment with a psychiatrist and made me promise her to go there. the psychiatrist said i immediately needed inpatient care, and soon after i was admitted to a psychiatric ward to detox from the alcohol. they gave me diazepam, despite my protests, since i already had a seizure. during withdrawals, i had my first major psychotic episode. i became incredibly paranoid, thought i was possessed, thought that i had personally killed my friend, thought i was responsible for another friends suicide, thought doctors could read and interfere with my thoughts, and i was hearing many nasty voices, always there, always commenting on everything i do. i was put on antipsychotics.

as soon as i get out of the psych ward, after a 2 month state, i start binging drugs like there is no tomorrow. i started with doing speed at parties, and it all spiraled when i discovered the world of RCs. i have binged every single RC i could get my hands on. stims, dissos, psychedelics, opioids, all of them. my mental health saw a sharp decline and i reached a point where i really didnt care anymore if i was alive or if i was dead. the highs were high and the lows were devastating. this all culminated to one day, without any significant opiate tolerance, i took 70mg morphine, 30mg oxycodone, took 7mg xanax to chase it down, and had a few drinks. naturally i stopped breathing and i turned blue in the lips and on the hands. some acquaintances found me unconscious at the front door of my apartment building and an ambulance was called. my life was saved.

when i was discharged i went on the biggest binge i have ever done in my life. i didnt sleep for a week. then i decided to do LSD, which was a terrible, terrible, terrible idea. after a trip from hell, it finally dawned on me. i have hit rock bottom. if i dont get clean NOW, i will die. i checked myself in the psych ward again, and that initial drug test came positive foe EVERYTHING they were checking for. i stayed for another two months, and this time i absolutely dedicated myself to getting clean. it had to work on myself, and i had to learn how to get my schizophrenia under control.

i made what my friends describe as a miraculous recovery. i moved back to my home country to stay with my family. i got psychiatric help and was put on medication that actually helps me function. i havent had many psychotic symptoms since. a year and a half later, i am enrolled in school and doing well, i have lots of friends and lots of hobbies, i am getting disability benefits to support myself, and i have learned many healthy ways to cope with my illness, without being destructive.

the fear of relapse looms over me every day, like a dark cloud. i keep thinking to myself, maybe you can do drugs responsibly this time, maybe you can do them just once. i do get cravings. but i know that i cant. once i start again, everything that i strived so hard to accomplish will go down the drain. if i relapse, it will be my new rock bottom. by participating in the drugs related subreddits and sharing my experiences and knowledge with other people, i have found a way to live the drug life vicariously, through others, without wanting to go back myself.

i wrote all this text because i wanted to share my story with you guys, but also as a message of hope. it gets better. it may not seem like it, but really, really, it does get better. you have to fight really hard for it, but it gets better. i never could imagine that i could live a healthy life ever again, but here i am disproving that, every day. there is always hope, never lose it. you can do it and it gets better.",Addiction

"I am 15 M (Sophomore in Highschool). I have became addicted to pills,weed,and vaping. Every time I try to stop taking them,I just got sick. They are also so addictive.

This addiction started last school year at around May. I was going through a lot at the time and I had lots of crackhead friends at school. I had heard that drugs can help settle your mind so I asked my friends if I could try it out. Not only did weed help settle my mind but it also helped me sleep and it actually made me feel calm. However this situation got worst as time went on. I started cancelling plans with family to go smoke with friends and go to parties.

This school year has made my addiction even worse with the tougher classes and all. I have also started skipping classes to smoke. My grades are pretty much awful because I don?t do my work because every time I?m in class I?m either high or sleep.",Addiction
"So - I?m struggling because all of my boyfriends close friends regularly do coke and Xanax. My boyfriend smokes a lot of weed daily which is a problem in itself (again, his own realization), but I wouldn?t say he has a problem with any other drugs necessarily. He did drugs when he was younger, but he?s told me it was never much of a problem, and he can quit whenever. He?s ?quit? weed a couple times at the drop of a hat throughout our relationship and has been loads happier- but then idk. Got bored?

Anyway - He doesn?t hang out with these friends much, because he?s a homebody. But when he does (usually out of town cause they?ve all moved) he goes way overkill on coke, posts unnecessary photos on social media stories (nothing awful, just obviously high), and then wakes up telling me he has a problem, is super ashamed, feels like shit etc etc.

What confuses me is that he doesn?t have a problem on a day to day basis- but when he goes out with friends it?s a whole other story, he loses all control, and says he has a problem.

I?ve been out with him and friends before and honestly he?s a nightmare. He has no control, drinks way too much, does too much coke, and he?s lowkey a monster. He?s not nice to me, and it?s disturbing for me because he?s normally a very sweet guy. Even his friends have been like?? Dude you can?t treat her like that? He seems to be the only one who turns into some other person - the rest are pretty like themselves, but high.

I?m not tryna be that girl who tells him to ditch all of his friends cause they drag him down - but every time he?s with them he?s someone I don?t recognize? It?s not even his friends that are pressuring, it?s just when he?s around them he feels pressure to? He?s the guy everyone comes to for advice an solace, and feels responsible for all of his friends.

We often plan a trip somewhere, or go to visit someone, then he gets fired up, gets absolutely fucked up, and then the whole trip is ruined for days and he feels ashamed.

And the hard part for me, is that he?s totally aware all of this is going to happen. Yet, does it anyway and then feels like a loser.

I just need some advice on the next step to take because I don?t know if this addiction, or something else.

Sometimes it feels more like he?s trying to impress his friends or something - and his approach is concerning. Every time he goes to seem them he gets a haircut, and buys a bunch of new clothes and tries to look his best. Maybe it?s just me, but idgaf if my friends think I look my best lol - I?m there to chill.

Idk - something is going on here.

It cost me pretty much everything I had, and I managed to get myself clean. Up until around mid 2021 I didn't work, so I decided to find myself employment and ended up going to a job where most of the workforce used some sort of drug, whether it be coke or weed.

"(TW: mentions of suicide, mental health, and obviously drug abuse) I feel stupid asking for help here but I genuinely have nowhere else to go. My best friend (18) has in the past year started doing a great deal of drugs. It started off with weed, but now they?re taking oxy. They have a lot of trauma and mental health issues, which no one but me has been properly informed about. They very often threaten to kill themselves and generally just talk about suicide a lot. We go to boarding school together, and I?ve been supporting them through all this since the drug problem thing started. Due to a lot of home/parental issues, they don?t believe themselves to be as ill as they are, which has made it very hard to convince them to get help. For half a year now I?ve been trying to get them to go to a psych ward, and two weeks ago, after a horrible episode, they finally agreed (only because I told them to). They were there for a week, prescribed antidepressants, discharged. They did not tell the staff the whole story, left out the drug abuse. They?re too scared of the repercussions it may have now that they?re 18. Now that they?re back home for the holidays, they?re doing much higher dosages of oxy. I am the only one who knows, and I am not even there to help them if anything happens. I thought the psych ward would help, but it seems to have just completely diminished any chance of them wanting help. I haven?t slept for days, thinking they may be dead. I?m only 16, and I don?t know what else I can do. I talk to them constantly, and they have told me I?m the only reason they?re still alive. I love them to death, and am far too scared to tell anyone because they would kill themselves if I did. I just feel so lost and have no idea how to help them out of this.

My grades are suffering, I know i am fucking myself but the only time I like myself is on drugs and the only time I don?t want to die is when high. I just need some advice on what I should do. Like ik i should stop doing drugs but please be more specific on how i do that and how i can enjoy my life and how to climb out of this hole i have been digging.

"My drug of choice for the longest time was booze. I have no idea how or why I became addicted. There is no obvious explanation for it. But I did and eventually that became too destructive so I found a new escape in gambling. One that I could hide from the world, and didn't risk me landing in jail or hurting someone during a blackout. I have a serious Jekyll and Hyde complex, and its scary enough that I want nothing to do with alcohol.

I've tried for years to find reprieve and have never found success. AA, GA, Counseling have been of no use. So instead I try to control it, and minimize the damage it causes. I put up barriers to prevent me from wasting our money. I send my wife my pay check (or try to, it doesn't always get there), I've intentionally tanked my credit so I can't borrow. I've disabled cash advances on my card and banned myself wherever possible from the casinos. And for the most part this stuff has allowed me to be a functional addict. I leave just room to get a taste of that escape I crave so much.

The thing is I'm miserable as all hell when I'm not gambling. I'm just surviving life until my next paycheck and my next hit. The worst part is that there is no guarantee that the ""hit"" is coming any time soon. The thing with gambling is the hit only comes when you win, and the system is designed to make you lose. So after waiting 14 days for my next paycheck and losing all the money I set aside for my addiction in 15 mins, my brain just begins to unravel. When I'm in this place I can't tolerate the world. I can't tolerate my job. I can't tolerate every single person in this world because for the most part they just get in the way of me doing what I want. Most regrettably I can't tolerate my wife and son (whom I love more than anything). I still find joy in doing things with them, but the daily grind of work, chores, sleep, work, chores, sleep wears me out so much that I just want to space out and then I resent them for ""forcing"" me to participate in life.

If this goes on for long enough, I eventually turn to the one thing that is guaranteed to give me temporary relief....the bottle. In one night I can cause so much damage that it takes years to repair and I've come dangerously close to making mistakes that can't be undone.

My wife is on the verge of leaving me. Between all the wasted money, the constant mood swings, or the fear of me coming home drunk, she is simply at her limit. And now we have a three year old son she needs to protect from me. My biggest fear before having a child was that they might inherit this from me. The reality is that I am actively guiding him down that path with my behavior but I just can't stop. I'm broken and there doesn't seem to be a fix.

I've had suicidal thoughts for years. I don't know that I was close to acting on them but they scared the hell out of me. They went away completely when my son was born. He gave me a sense of purpose and strength that I didn't know existed. I WANT to be there with him for whatever life throws his way but now I'm beginning to wonder if he would be better off without me. These thoughts are starting to creep back in my head and I'm terrified that they will get worse.

I feel better after writing this though. I've bottled it up inside for so long or maybe it's because I've only said these things before to people who just can't possibly understand. I never shared this at meetings because I didn't want to ""be a downer"" in rooms that were largely full of people re-affirming how much better their lives were in sobriety.",Addiction

I said I never would get addicted I was always careful with my use but it?s gotten out of hand. I can?t go 8 hours without them. The dangerous thing is I drink aswell but I never mix the 2 at the same time. I?m only 17 and I smoke a lot of weed and I smoke cigarettes. They forced me to quit weed when the benzos are the main problem they just don?t understand they are from a different generation and they think that because I?m prescribed them it?s ok and they freak out over weed because I?m in a country where it?s illegal. In reality I should be getting of the Valium?s and then the weed after but they just don?t get it what do I do.,Addiction

"this is my first reddit post but i wrote a poem about how i was feeling yesterday on a day when it was very hard to stay away from the drugs and i thought maybe i?ll share the poem.

pain is something i know all too well it is the one thing that is always there in the darkness of my own soul i have nothing but myself and the pain and the escape i found from the pain the moments of euphoria when i could escape i?d kill for that feeling to come again yet that euphoria could kill me too when you?re in pain you take pain medicine so i swallowed pill after pill trying to make the pain stop for that moment of euphoria for the numbness from the pain anything to escape my problems all i ever wanted was to feel good and the drugs gave me that feeling yet they brought me to death?s door and when i woke up i knew i had to stop i?m not scared of dying everyone has to die someday but i?m not ready yet so i drag on i stopped taking the pills i stopped so why do i feel this way the pain has returned and it?s stronger now and this time i don?t know who i am who have i become? i always had goals so nobody could ever tell they never knew how far gone i was it?s so hard to talk about it now yet so freeing in some ways i thought sobriety would make it easier but life only seems harder i don?t want to relapse i tried too hard to get here 33 days today yet the drugs are all i think about how easy it would be to say just one more time but one more time is never just one more time one more time will be my downfall they say 40 to 60 percent of addicts relapse can i beat the statistics? do i have any chance? or is there no point? do i let the drugs control me? because i sure as hell don?t control them. am i a catastrophe waiting to happen?",Addiction
"Hey Reddit0rs, I'm 32yo male from western germany and I'm struggeling with my heroin addiction. I am a heavy nose user for about 2-3g/d and i want to quit.

Somelike to wait till the first wd symptoms start bothering me and then snort just that amout to stop them, then again wait till the first signs of wds symptoms come and snort just how much it need to end them.

"My friends and I started doing drugs casually 8 years ago. You know how it goes, we started off smoking a little weed, having a good, innocent time. At the time, we would often preach about not doing anything stronger, that weed was enough yada yada yada.

Though, as time went by, we evolved from mere stoners, into ""Jacks of all Trades"". LSD, MDMA, Shrooms, 2CB, Cocaine, Ketamine, Percs, and various kinds of ADHD medication, and once in a blue moon a little anti-anxiety. Even though we eventually ended up forsaking the mantra of never doing anything stronger, we still strived to treat the drugs and the frequency with respect and care. And I must admit, most of the boys are doing quite well for themselves with career, relationships, etc. We are by no stretch of our imagination doing perfect, but we can look ourselves in the mirrors (unless we're coming down from MDMA lol)

One of the boys was always the one enjoying and consuming drugs slightly more often and with a little less care, through the years. He abused MDMA at an early age and developed Serotonin Syndrome in the space of 1 year, where he really burned his fingers. After that, he would slow down a little and primarily do downers and psychs, and we thought he had learned his lesson.

Fast-forward to the summer of 2021.
My friend attended the local University and was finishing his bachelor's degree, and everything seemed to be going OK. He had passed all his exams, except 1, in which he had to attend a re-examination at the beginning of the upcoming school year. So my friend was enjoying himself through the summer and celebrating a little prematurely since he was basically done. I don't blame him, and I certainly did my fair share of drugs thru the summer, as well. He started experimenting with PCP and a lot of designer drugs thru the darkweb, and it was all fun and games until he eventually received some bad news. His study group contacted him, and basically communicated ""We don't want to be in a study group with you, you aren't responsible, find somebody else."" This news broke my guy, and he ended up totally spiraling out of control, especially with PCP and opiates.

He never managed to attend the final exam. He now spends all of his money on drugs.
Lends money from his parents to buy drugs. Only sleeps every second day.
Only eats a couple of times a week, and it's always cardboard pizzas.
Thrashes his apartment once in a while, when he gets angry. Goes to the hospital once in a while, we aren't even surprised anymore. When he's sober, he's just laying in bed in fetal position, he's obviously depressed. Yesterday, a fellow friend told me he started boofing heroin. The icing on the cake (or lack thereof) he fucking tried making a move on my girl man, behind my back, and he considers me one of his best friends, you know, one of the boys.

I've talked with him since, and even tho he was extremely embarrassed and regretful, it seems like all the worry, advice, and comfort we pour into him, goes in one ear and goes out the other. Nothing seems to stick.

In the space of 8 months, I've seen one of my friends fully transforming into a full-blown addict/junkie.

So, my question is: What can I do? How do I help my friend? Can I help my friend? Should I tell authorities/family?

I haven't forgiven him for making a move on my girl, but I don't wanna see him like this, it's going to kill him.",Addiction
"I?m posting this after writing this comment on an AMA and I really want help/advice.

I never thought i?d be here. I?m writing this because Of someone I met. shortly had what I believed was a connection found out she is a meth addict. I was very very oblivious to it as I really stereotyped addicts as ?zombies? and non functioning and wasn?t educated. Have no family history or people I know that used. I am now much more aware. all the signs were there. She never stole from me I left her alone at my house often while at work numerous times over 3 months and Looking back it would have been way too easy to clean out my house and disappear, idk maybe that?s why I think there?s hope? When I found out (caught using in my house) I told her very politely with no argument I had to take her home and we couldn?t talk anymore, honestly because it scared me. She didn?t want to talk about it either just said ?yeah this was too good to be true I?m not good enough, you?re the nicest anyones ever been to me I knew this would end just take me home it?s fine? seemed very ashamed. That was over a month ago and now I?ve just been diving deeper and deeper, learning about addiction and finding groups like these. She still occasionally messages me memes, or says she ?might have forgot? things at my house she left over that she wants to get which isn?t true and I ignore most of it or give dry/deflective responses. She told me ?stories? like she?s been physically abused in the past but looking back at the signs it might still be current.

I know addicts really clean up when THEY are ready and I?m only a stranger but My question for you guys is there anything I can do to HELP her from an addicts perspective? (Or anyone who?s helped before?) When I say help I don?t mean miraculously make her stop. I have no wishes right now to romantically Persue her like not even in the slightest. I was initially ignorant and angry and now I just feel bad for not realizing this drug changes your mind. She would talk down on herself a lot. She comes from a very poor family, do I just send a message saying I?m willing to talk/be a friend? I mean it still seems like she?s pointlessly reaching out and I don?t give her drugs or money?? I bought her various personal hygiene products while we spent time at my house that she seemed to appreciate should I still offer to bring some? Is there anything others could have done different for YOU as an addict? I want to just forget about this whole thing but I really just can?t.

"I've never been this depressed before. I started using Tramadol about 2 years ago and it dramatically improved my mood, my work, etc. I've dealt with depression and anxiety (including a panic disorder) for about 15 years. Once I started using Tramadol, I felt legitimately happy for the first time in my life. I was killing it at work, exercising daily, had a great sex life and relationships, etc.

Then my online connect went away. I started snorting heroin to avoid withdrawals. The last time I used was January 29th, but I was weaning and really trying to get clean since the end of November. Since then, I've been completely useless. I lost my job. I used to play music (my banjo) every day and now I barely touch it. I have no sex drive and it's difficult for me to even become aroused.

I've never felt so fucking hopeless. I am constantly thinking about suicide. I've tried several antidepressants to no avail. The last antidepressant I was taking, Wellbutrin, led to a grand mal seizure 2 weeks ago and I spent 4 days (including my birthday) in the hospital.

I've been forcing myself to exercise for the past couple days in hopes that it will help me heal. I just don't know what to do or how to cope right now. I guess I'd just like to hear from some people who came out the other side of opioid addiction.

I'm no stranger to addiction. I was addicted to benzos for 4 years and OD'd on them, opioids and alcohol in 2015 and almost lost my life. Went through a horrific benzo withdrawal for 6 months with crippling anxiety, but I've never felt this hopeless, this depressed, this suicidal.

I used to be the funny extrovert who made everyone laugh. I'm a shell of my former self. I've tried Suboxone but it didn't help. I'm considering going to the doctor to plead for Tramadol as there are studies that show it is an effective antidepressant, but I know it's extremely unlikely and it will just lead to addiction again.",Addiction

"I've seen everywhere that until you address underlying issues, you'll never get past your addiction. Well, I'm on antidepressants for severe ocd with anxiety and depression. I was molested as a kid.

"I know a lot of addicts and people in recovery, and it always seems so much harder and more severe for them than it does for me, so I usually don't reach out or talk about things when I am struggling I guess? I don't want to cause problems in their recovery, and I was never taking anything that was ""hard"" or ""severe"" or stereotypically done by an addict. But I'm having a hard time now, and I just want support I guess because I feel like I don't have anyone else to talk to about things.

I abused sleeping pills for a little while, mostly OTC and if I could get my hands on them prescriptions, but one time I took way too many OTC sleep meds and scared a bunch of people and screwed up my brain and memory pretty badly. After that, I just overkilled it on weed, and after that I grew very hyperfixated on whippits, and then I scared my fiance pretty badly a couple times and now I don't do anything. He doesn't know it's been really hard for me, because he's been in recovery from crack and narcotics for almost 2.5 years, and I don't want to make it harder for him.

I've been able to stop myself from taking them without much external help, at the most it's insisting people I live with hide anything like what I used to take and focusing on my cat when I get really bad cravings or feel like I can't keep myself from not buying any of it, but today's just... Extra hard. It always gets really hard when life gets hard, and life has been really hard, so not doing anything is hard.

I really want to, but at the same time I don't. I want to throw everything away and relapse in about 5 ways, and even thinking about my cat isn't helping. Nothing is, and I'm kind of scared of myself right now, and I'm sitting at work just deliberating how bad it would actually be (not very, in my brain right now) to buy a whole bunch of whippets and sleep meds and alcohol and go home and do all of it at once before my fiance gets home so I don't have to face life and everything going on in it. So I won't have to wake up tomorrow and drag myself to work or out on a date or whatever, and pretend that everythings going fine, all my issues are resolved and I'm pleased with all my circumstances.

I don't think any of my friends would really take me seriously if I talked to them about this because these are just normal things they take without concern. They were hooked on hard stuff, and I'm sitting over here scared of myself for wanting to do whippits and I feel like they'll just think I'm silly because they haven't cared when they've seen me do so many back to back that I turn blue and pass out and no one wakes me up until it's tomorrow morning and my alarm for work is going off. They don't care I'm having conversations with my dead brother in the other room because I took half a bottle of sleeping pills and it's only a problem when I start to lose my shit and wreck the place.

I think I just don't care anymore. And that scares me a lot. And I think I just want to hear someone tell me they're proud of me for staying ""sober"" for... I don't even know how long, I don't count the days, but I think it would be nice to just hear someone tell me they're proud of me for staying clean, and that it would be better to keep it that way, even if the people around me don't really get that it is a struggle for me and I am having to put a lot of daily active effort into not just falling back into it all again.

I'm just really tired. And I want to give up, but I also don't, and I feel like wanting to give up is a bit stronger than not right now.",Addiction
"When we enter recovery it is seldom in a good place. For the most part, it is the worst possible place you have ever been. We enter it with our eyes closed and blind faith. At first, we fumble around in our sobriety and hold on to dear life counting each and every day as a miraculous achievement, and of course, it is just that. As time goes by we celebrate our achievement as another year of evolution where we have grown and matured into the adults we should have become before life and addiction took hold, different people, in different ways.

As we sink deeper into the dynamics of recovery we find we may have recovered to the degree insofar we can delve deeper into our quest. Sometimes we think of our recovery as a destination, counting of the years the date so deeply ingrained into our minds we can count down the days until our next anniversary and this is all part of the joys we find in our newfound freedom from the desire to pick up. This is an important part of our journey and the blessings and gifts along the way.*

Just for today, I am almost 9yrs sober and clean from my drugs of no choice and I realise now that the true celebration should be done each and every day we are sober and clean, as just for today suggests when we keep it in the day it lightens the load and that dates are egoic projections of a perceived race in which we are the winners or losers. Just for today, I will celebrate this day as I would any other by being kind to myself and others, by keeping an open heart and an unshakeable belief in my god of understanding/higher power.

Today I am humbled by my achievements as I reflect on my journey and marvel at my strength. I will focus on my gratitude for the things that led me here, the people, the places, and the things. The pain, sorrow, and misery of reliving an old story played on a perpetual loop our egoic mantras if you will, these stories take center stage and become our fate for more of the same. Today I will celebrate this day as I would any other by being kind to myself and others, by keeping an open heart and an unshakeable belief in my god of understanding/higher power.

"I first started doing meth by accident. The spring break of my senior year of college, I decided to gift myself a trip to San Francisco, for the week, to celebrate graduating from college. About half way into my trip I met a guy off of grindr with the intent to get laid. When I arrived he offered something out of this odd shaped pipe, I figured it was weed and took a puff. I was unaware that what I just smoked, was actually meth. It wasn?t until a few months later that I used again while hooking up with a couple in Seattle, this is when I made the connection to my trip to California. Fast forward to the end of August, and I found myself graduating from smoking meth to injecting it. Meth is something that is plaguing the gay community. It piggy-backs on every gay man?s false-notion that they have to have porn star sex for hours. I?ve been on this back-and-forth struggle for going on a decade now. My using has never really been consistent, every 6 months for a weekend or two, then I stop. But since losing my job in 2020 because of the Covid pandemic, my use became more frequent, happening twice a month or more for the course of a year. It?s now 2022 and nothing has change, I?m having issues maintaining a job, and my use is continuing to increase.

"I (27F) used to be a high functioning alcoholic. I had a job I was good at, I cleaned my apartment, did my laundry, paid my bills. Until I wasn't. Until my mom died last year.

I've been in therapy for 13 years for anxiety and depression. I think what finally turned me onto alcohol (when I was 20) was that it gave me so many things I couldn't give myself. It was a quick fix. It gave me a building block to begin a foundation I couldn't build on my own.

My alcoholism, depression, and anxiety co-exist now; but my alcoholism is a symptom of my mental illness, not the cause. Alcohol gave me a personality. It gave me a social life that I was too anxious to have sober. It made some of my hobbies more enjoyable. It made me not afraid to stand up for myself. It took away my shaky hands (which may be caused by anxiety, or a neurological disorder). I could do anything, handle anything.

I went to my intake today for IOP, and as soon as my clinician said ""you have to look inside yourself in order to move forward,"" my brain short circuited. My throat started to close up with anxiety. There's nothing there. There's nothing inside me. My personality was my job, my mental illness and trauma, and school. I have no hobbies I really enjoy without alcohol. I don't enjoy talking to others. I don't know where to start. I have no motivation to find out.

I hate that I was able to get this far in life without figuring out my mental illness. I hate that all the tools they give you in IOP/Therapy haven't worked for me. I hate that I hate what I see when I look inside. I hate that I don't know what to do with that.",Addiction

Anyways. I'm seriously reaching a breaking point but giving up bad habits (which at this point, let's be honest, are bad lifestyle choices) is difficult. Especially if you're leaning on them for their powerful copium. I had a bad breakup that fucked me up. Threw away FOUR YEARS of not drinking, constant AA, and now I've been drinking about this girl every day for nearly a year. Not only that but I also picked up weed again, and try not to go more than 15 mins without a cigarette in my mouth. My self esteem has never been so low. What kills me is knowing that AA and taking sobriety seriously will change my entire life; it's already done it once. But I'm so deep in this hole that the thought of living without my precious chemical pacifiers at all times feels like a fate worse than death.

I just want to stand on the top of the mountain again. I wanna know if anyone here has been in my shoes. I wanna know how you got out.

"I'll try to make this as succinct as possible. My father has been an addict since he was in his 20s, and he is about 55 now. I think it started with cocaine and lead to other substances, but now it's alcohol. He has been in and out of rehab many times and has multiple DUIs. For the past 10 years or so he hasn't been able to hold down a job, and he stays at my grandparents (his parents) house. I have a few theories for how he is able to still acquire alcohol, even though his parents hide all the car keys in the house from him and don't give him money. They give him a roof over his head, food, and a pack of cigarettes whenever he asks.

Growing up he was emotionally and physically abusive to me and my mom, so obviously our relationship is not the best. I will always love him because he is my dad, but I do make it an effort to keep a fair distance. Recently he has been drinking a lot, and apparently it has been pretty bad. My grandmother called me last week and is begging for me to convince my grandfather (her husband) to send my dad to a rehab facility. My grandparents are incredibly wealthy so cost is not an issue, but my grandfather doesn't think another round of rehab is going to do anything.

I have had to play the role of the parent child many times in my life, and I am in therapy for all that I have been through. As much as I feel that it is not my responsibility to have this conversation since I am the kid, my grandmother is so scared that something is going to happen to my Dad I think she's desperate.

I obviously want my dad to get better. My mom always tells me stories of how amazing he was when they first met and during the first few years after I was born. The only reason I have doubts is because of what comes after rehabilitation. Yes my dad will go into a program for 3 months, but what will he do after? Are there some form of work programs for recovering addicts? I'm just worried that he is going to return to the same house, and fall into the same habits as before. And it will all be for nothing.",Addiction

on another hand, one of the reasons i've been able to stay ""sober"" is because i recently started using amphetamines.

i don't feel like this is a case of swapping one addiction for another. using them doesn't make me spiral into self destruction like drinking did, but i still get a pang of guilt when the people i love tell me that they're so proud of me for being ""sober"".

"My Wife and I have been struggling with our relationship. It?s been an on and off issue for a few years now. Well recently we had a huge ?discussion? regarding my lack of communication and how it?s changing her feelings toward me. And with everything going on in our lives, she?s been a beer a huge amount of stress, causing anxiety and an inability to get a good night?s rest.

Fast forward to tonight. I randomly checked her location to see if she would be home in time before I put our daughter to sleep. We both have demanding careers that sometimes cause us to work late hours.

When I realized she was at a ?friend?s? house, I questioned where she was and her response was she was on her way home. I asked if she just left work, to which she just avoided answering the question. Later that night, I called her out and she admitted she was getting Xanax.

I?m so angry but I?m more hurt that she was going to completely hide it from the one person she?s supposed to tell everything.

Maybe Xanax is what she needs, but I just wish she would?ve talked to me and went to a doctor instead of taking it upon herself to self diagnose and self medicate. I just don?t know what to do here. I?m feeling so loss and disconnected from the person I love the most.",Addiction

"I thought I?d share some things about my experience as an addict. I?m 25, male. I watched Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas when I was twelve and after it finished I walked back to my bedroom as if I was on ether, downloading Hunter?s personality completely. My sisters friend told her I was ?fucked? when he found out it was my favourite movie and novel. Despite how dark the trips were in the movie I romanticised it. Just like I romanticised the life of Kurt Cobain and Jim Morrison, my idols. I carry the pain of being a creative entity. Feeling too much and forever living inside of my head. I smoked weed from 12 onwards and binged alcohol at parties. I became fascinated with psychonaut explorations with psychedelics from age 16 onwards despite the ghost tour guide in high school telling me psychedelics ?damage your spiritual webs?. When I was 18 I got drug induced psychosis for a year from eating a meth pill. I continued to use and party regardless. 5 years later age 23 I went to rehab. It saved my life. From drinking morning to night, from snorting mountains of crushed dexamphetamine and benzos. From spending my rent money on ketamine. I?ve hit rock bottom so many times and relapsed so many times back into the depths of psychosis, nearing death and hurting loved ones and still I ?choose? to use. I keep falling back into the trap of romanticising the emotional pain of addiction and life. But with every relapse it gets easier to stop using. Right now I?m abusing coffee and cigarettes, caffeinated into oblivion. Stoicism is my philosophy of nature. Although I do become quite nihilistic when I?m coming down.

"I?m going to try and keep this short and to the point because it?s a complicated family issue. My aunt has a lot of mental health and alcohol issues. She was living with her daughter for 15 years until her daughter kicked her out back in September. Long story short, my aunt was being verbally and mentally abused by her grandson?s friends that now controlled that house and she cried everyday about it to me. Finally, my aunt stood up for herself and told the manager that these guys were living there without being added to the lease and the manager told them the guys have to move out. That?s why her daughter kicked her out. Anyway, my aunt moved into a cheap motel for 2 weeks until I finally gave in and told her she could stay with me for a few months until she saves up some money and gets her life in order. I found a room 3 months later within walking distance from me so we checked it out and she agreed to live with a friendly woman also in her 60s. Everything seemed like it was working out, my aunt seemed to have her life in order again. Then her best friend called me 4 days ago and asked me to take my aunt back in. I asked why, this friend told me the new housemate was taking advantage of my aunt financially, basically my aunt paid for a Costco membership, paid for all the groceries, etc. Apparently my aunt bought this lady and herself a 12 pack of beer every night and they were drinking excessively.

So I told my aunts friend, I?ll talk to the both of them and see if we can get this resolved. The friend asked why I just don?t take my aunt back and I told her that I want to try and talk to them first. Her friend then goes, ?well she drinks a lot with this lady, when she stays with you, she only has a 6 pack every night?? I kinda hinted to her friend that that?s the whole problem.

So I need some advice, should I try moving my aunt back in and deal with her BS until I find a new housemate for her or do I tell her she needs to stand up for herself, don?t pay for everything and cut down on her drinking?

It?s so mentally draining for me because my aunts friend accuses me of not caring since I have an empty room available.

Basically, I feel even if I got her a new housemate and found her a new room to rent, she?d still fall into trouble because she can?t say no to people. She insists on paying for everything and she likes to buy beer for people because she wants people to drink a lot with her everyday. So yes, the housemate is probably taking advantage of that but a lot of other people would be doing the same and I tell my aunt to stop paying for people and start learning how to say no. She claims she?s afraid people won?t like her if she says no. I always cringe when she tells me that because it sounds like something a child would say.

"Havent had nicotine or coke since September and havent touched weed since late november, and just generally don't drink as much as a result. I'm currently 3/4s the way through a bottle of red and I just want to fully send it. Coke cigs blunts anything else I can get my hands on. Blasting music in my headphones, 1000s of miles from home and my homies. If I had a decent grasp on my career and life trajectory I wouldn't think twice about indulging. Covid threw me for a loop and I had to take a step back from a few substances, but I still get that feeling. Still wanna indulge heavy. I just haven't had that bad of an experience with them, my deterrence is just my life stagnation and time wasting tendencies. Also family alcoholism is a cause for concern. Not sure if I am able to fully enjoy a sober lifestyle. I honestly have not enjoyed my experience thus far. Feel free to critique my train of thought but at this current moment my biggest motivator for getting back to the grind is feeling validated to getting funky with subtances with my friends. I can't seem to motivate myself any other way. I think I am getting to the point where I will latch onto whatever motivation I can get my hands on. Like honestly, what is the threshold for changes ones behaviour? I can cut off every substance but I still dick around. When I was at my most degenerate I was making the most money I had ever and felt rather kingly. Not I'm like half sober jobless without any direction. If its not substances its sex, if its not sex its maturbation, like I can't just deprive myself of everything right? Mad respect to anybody who responds to this absolute mess of a paragraph",Addiction
"Update: I first want to start by thanking everyone for their kind words and advice. It truly meant more than you can ever imagine. This update isn?t the one I was hoping for but one that I thought might happen. I apologize if this is long.

I flew down with my best friend Thursday morning with the understanding that I would see him that afternoon. We had been communicating since he called me on Sunday. He even offered to pick me up from the airport, which I politely declined. I called and texted all afternoon, the phone was ringing and going to voicemails. My friend and I drove by where he was staying hoping we might see him outside or in the area. He didn?t respond to me until around 8pm and said sorry his phone was off and then stopped responding again.

Friday we woke up and came up with a plan that if he didn?t call me back or text me by 3PM I would request a wellness check. We actually weren?t sure how wellness checks work in that area so we drove to the local police station just to get some information. The officer I spoke with was so kind and empathetic which isn?t something I?ve experienced before with officers in situations regarding addicts. She gave me all the information I needed and included her personal cellphone number and asked that I update her if I hear back from my brother.

He texted me in the afternoon saying that his and the girl he?s with were going to sign a lease and should be done by 3:30pm. My friend and I were went to the hotel at 2:30pm and camped out by the parking lot entrance - this hotel only have one entrance into the parking lot so we would be able to see them come and go. By 4pm we haven?t seen them so I call him and he actually answered and said ?oh we just got back? and I said ?ok we?ll I?m outside your hotel, you need to come downstairs?. 20 minutes later they both came down. My friend moved the car because next to the entrance of the hotel has a little seating area where I was going to move them to so we could sit and talk. She wanted to be able to see me good forbid anything happened.

My heart sank when I saw him but I held in my tears. They are both so skinny. My brother specially is about 5?11 and couldn?t be more than 115 pounds. He had sores around his mouth from the crack pipe and track marks on his arms. His cheeks were hallow. He?s never looked worse, but I?m glad I had people prepare me to an extent, but it was still heartbreaking.

I kept the conversation light with them since they were both together because my goal was to get him alone to have a conversation. I did offer them both help and said I will drive them home both right now if they were ready. But they said they weren?t. However she said she was going to work at a bar at 6pm and I took that opportunity to tell my bother ?perfect let me take you for dinner!? He was declining at first but the girl he?s with encouraged him to go.

At dinner is where I got more serious. He doesn?t even remember calling me and saying those things. He only remembered parts when I texted him Monday saying I wasn?t driving down that day but I booked my flight for Thursday morning. He tried to tell me they?re not using as much as I think they are. I looked him right in the eyes and said ?you are addicts and you are lying to me?.

He told me all these plans they had about moving down permanently to where they are. Reasons they couldn?t come home. All the things people say when they aren?t ready. I?m proud of myself for not getting emotional because I needed him to know how serious I was about the things I was going to say next.

He told me that they planned on getting sober on 5/1 and I asked ?what are they waiting for? and he just closed his eyes and cried. He said ?Our heads are above water? and I said that?s not enough. I reminded him of the value he has, and the support he has and that while he will have to face his trauma when he gets sober that I will be there to support him. I reminded him that his best friend who doesn?t use (most of his friends also use back home) is desperate to here from him and to know he?s ok. She?s even offered that if he gets clean he can move in with her states away for a fresh start to get away from all his old friends and still have a support system.

He told me he?s not ready and doesn?t want help. I told him that if he continues like this I cannot have a relationship with him. That I can?t worry about if he?s dead or alive. I can?t spend my time calling random phone numbers hoping it?s his. That I can?t call police stations and hotels go find out information. That my mental health is can?t suffer because of his addiction.

He got so angry and started yelling at me asking how I could do this to him. That I?m the only person that has loved him through this no matter what. That I?m the only person he cares about enough to checkin with when he?s ready. That I?m the only person who tries to make sure he?s ok. I said I that I am not doing this to him, that his addiction is. He asked if he?s invited to my wedding in September and I said if you are not sober I cannot have you there. He started hitting the car dashboard and crying. He said he was getting out of the car and that they were planning to come home next weekend to visit for a few days.

I told him that he can call me but I will not answer. I told him that I loved him and I will always be there for him and that when he?s ready for help I will be there. I hugged him and cried and said ?I?m afraid this is the last time I?m going to see you?. He got out of the car and sat on the curb of the hotel entrance and cried. I drove away.

I obviously was hoping that the outcome was going to be different that he would come home and get help. That she would come home and get help. I knew that on a human level if he was ready and she wasn?t I would have to figure out a way to get her home. I?m friends with her sister and wouldn?t be able to leave her there on her own but I also knew going into it that they wouldn?t leave without each other.

I didn?t cry and haven?t cried since I left him. I went back to my hotel and slept and the next morning my friend and I got coffee and walked the beach before our flight. We actually saw a group of dolphins in the ocean which gave me this odd sense of peace. I know I did the right thing when he called me on Sunday and offered everything I could. But I set more boundaries around our relationship, ones that I will not go back on.

I have to regrets about going down and maybe I?m stupid to be hopeful that what I said left an impact and will help them realize it?s time for help, but I?m being realistic that they are going to continue to use until the end. Whatever their end maybe.

Original:My brother has been in active addiction for the last 10 years. I?ve watched him go from this giant personality who could light up a room to someone I no longer recognize.

He?s been missing since before thanksgiving and changed his phone number and hasn?t talked to anyone. His mail still goes to our dads house and I?ve been texting and calling the numbers on the phone bill just saying that I love him and I am always here for him no matter what.

Last night he finally called me just saying he loved me that he missed me and how sorry he was and that he needs me.

I don?t know if this is his cry for help but I will never give up on him. I booked my flights to where he is and will be going down Thursday with the hopes that I can bring him home and get him into treatment.

I?m not sure what to say when I get down there or really even what I should do. Any advice would be beyond appreciated. Even if this isn?t the time and he?s not ready, I just want him to know that no matter what when he?s ready I will be there.",Addiction
I've dealt with addiction for a while and tryin to get over it but my addictions never been anything serious though. Lately I've been struggling a lot and I want to feel better. I got curious and looked through the stuff in the closet and found a bunch of pill bottles from family members past surgeries. ,Addiction
"I used zoppies for sleep when I was 17. My mom uses them every night so it was easy. At 18, I realized how good they make me feel if I decide to stay awake instead. So, I started using them once a week for pleasure.

Then, I moved out and my depression got worse. I started finding excuses like ""I was supposed to use tomorrow, but I'm going out tomorrow so I guess I gotta use today"". Then, I realized that I couldn't stop anymore. Everyday without being high felt like shit in comparison. I was high basically every other day and was doing a lot of stupid shit like cutting myself while taking photos of it for my friends. It somehow made sense when high.

Then, my mom started using them more because of my brother went in jail for drugs so she needed more to sleep. Now she won't send me them anymore. I haven't used a single pill in over month. I'm 20 now.

But, now my mom has them again and I'm gonna see her today. I know how I'm happier without the pills. Especially since I've been without them for over a month already. I'm doing great and now is the best time to keep going.

But, just thinking about getting high today feels like I'm gonna see an old friend that I haven't seen in years. Every second I think about the pills, I physically feel amazing. I also haven't seen my friends or my dog in a month, but the fact that I miss the pills more than I miss my friends or my dog makes me sick.",Addiction
"This isn?t rocket science. I just took the classic addict route, I kept pushing until the consequences hit real hard. I?m not looking for sympathy, I?m just trying to process this.

I?m so disgusted by what I?ve done that I?m not capable of typing it yet? Because I know; my intellectual side is basically telling me you can?t go more wrong than this. Not just injuring yourself, but also putting others through lifelong issues.

? I think my emotional side still is hoping this will turn out all good, but it won?t, not this time. I might have screwed up before but this, oh shit, this is vile. There are so many levels of wrong doing, and the full scope of this hasn?t even been revealed yet.

I better just type some of the details, this is turning out pretty unclear. Contracted at least one blood STD, Hepatitis, afraid of HIV too to be honest. Married, pregnant wife at contraction, and a 4,5 y/o. This is about 6 month after that, because I?m showing symptoms and waiting for my hepatitis test result. I did screen for the regular STD:s before.

As I said, this is abominable, and I?m not looking for any petty. I?m merely typing this out for myself to process it. I know what kind of comments I?ll get already, because I wrote a similar post before during these events. And I fully agreed with every death wish.

Unfortunately I took the full addict arc. I thought I could manage until I couldn?t. Thought I was safe until I wasn?t. Thought I was in control until I wasn?t. Now I?ve put several lives in danger, and I?d probably continued if I would?ve gotten away with it.

I?ve straight up lied to my spouses face, even though she basically caught me. Her gut told her things weren?t adding up, but I stayed true to my (false) narrative. And this isn?t even the worst part. Reflecting upon my own behaviors I?m a complete self-centered coward; if I was truly worried more about them than me, I would?ve come clean a long time ago to precede potential risks. Now I?m still waiting for the test results, although I?m pretty sure what it will say this time, my symptoms are clear.

This is beyond repair, this is putting other lives in danger for a fix, and it?s pathetic that I haven?t manned up, I?m well aware.

Divorce is coming up and a life in solitude on my behalf. I couldn?t face anyone after this. But the fact that I?ve ruined my wife?s life and the upbringing of my two children is so much worse. I mean, it seems fair if she never wants to see me again, nor let me have anything to do with our children. And this is pure pain. And on top of that, there?s a great risk of life long chronic decease.

What I can?t wrap my head around is how I got here. I?m not stupid, on the contrary, people often regards me as clever and thoughtful. My moral compass was fine growing up, but in retrospect I can see it got screwed over time. And I had a decent upbringing, even though my parents were divorced. I thought I was too smart to possibly have caught some of the worsts STD:s known. On top of that - I?m a high school science teacher - I?m supposed to teach my students not to make these mistakes. I?m so detached from this side of my persona, it doesn?t feel like I could do these things.

I should just put an end to this pathetic monologue. As I said, this is probably some of the worst things you can put another person through, I?m well aware.",Addiction
"I knew they had a history of addiction/substance abuse and that they were a recovered addict. Found out the other day that they've been hiding their current relapse from me for months now. I've had to take them to the ER 4 times in the past month. They were recently diagnosed with a certain chronic disorder and we thought that was the cause of these episodes. We were even at one point both under the impression that it might even be a very serious and deadly disease and sought out specialists to get tests done.

One of the ERs we visited, which we went to twice, was fucking terrible and gave us no information whatsoever. They just gave them fluids and sent them home. It wasn't until the 3rd hospitalization that they told us ""hey by the way...you're extremely intoxicated and that might be exacerbating the chronic illness you have"". This shocked me because on the way to the hospital I asked them if they had anything to drink tonight and they said no, and i believed them because I was around them for the entire night and didn't see them drink a single drop of alcohol. When the nurse told us this I became extremely suspicious but thought I was overthinking things. We agreed: no more alcohol whatsoever.

I made sure to keep a good eye on them just in case, to make sure they weren't drinking, and for a couple weeks it seemed like they were making good on their promise. They had a few mild ""episodes"" after that that coincided with the chronic illness they were diagnosed with. And during those smaller episodes, they told me they had nothing to drink and I believed them because, again, I was around them and didn't see them drink at all.

Then the other day we had to take them to the ER again. I was beyond freaked out. We hadn't really gotten anything definite back from the specialist we were seeing and I thought the worst was going to happen; that they were going to die. I picked them up from the hospital and asked them again, ""did you drink tonight?"" and they told me ""no"". When we got home I noticed they did something weird: they went into our second bathroom, which I have never seen them use before. The second they came out I went in, did a quick search, and found a gigantic bottle of vodka hidden in one of the drawers. I confronted them about it and they finally admitted that they've been drinking HEAVILY these past few months, secretly and in incredibly elaborate ways, and using the fact that they were coincidentally, and legitimately, diagnosed with a chronic disorder to cover it up. I called their parents and we all set up an appointment at a rehab center.

I wasn't even mad at the elaborate betrayal or the lies and manipulation. I was, and am, just legitimately terrified, disturbed, and worried. I dropped them off today and while I'm glad they agreed to seek help I still mostly feel like I'm in shock and it hasn't really hit me yet. I have my own current struggles and history with substance abuse and addiction so I understand and just want to help. I just hate myself for not figuring this out/noticing this sooner. They aren't the type of person to normally lie or manipulate so I believed everything they told me. They might be in rehab for 3 months and there's no in-person visiting because COVID and I feel exhausted in every possible way. I know they're in good hands but I'm shocked that it went this far/got this bad. They're one of the nicest, sweetest, and most selfless persons I've ever met and I just want them to be okay.",Addiction
"I really can't remember, I had taken a small break to pass a drug test and that was on Wednesday. After the test I left and got geeked. It was a wild week. I know I slept one time a little bit after 8 am and slept in until 5. And then I went and got geeked again. I can't go to sleep yet due to family. I don't know why I did this to myself. I have to stay up for at least 5 more hours. I don't know if I can make it. Started with auditory hallucinations and then somewhat real visual ones nothing too crazy though. I've had to play cool because of my family being with me. I have someone coming over to help me sleep tonight but that's in like 5 hours. I drink two 5-hour energies about an hour ago but now my body feels really high and I can't stop shaking. This may have been the stupidest string of decisions I've ever made. I gotta ditch my using buddies. I am trying to stay standing and taking little breaks to sit / squat in position that I can't crash in. Every time I stay up for more than 2 days I start getting those auditorium hallucinations and they really freak me out. This time around they sound so real.

"So we moved to this apt building like less than a year ago, and it's been nothing but hell. Worst part is our management who keeps brushing things off like they don't exist. There are a bunch of people live across from us, and they've been smoking some kind of substance, we aren't sure what it is. Smell's awful 1am- till 8 am, right before management office opens. It keeps us awake all night, and gives us headaches. I honestly can't even think or do anything when I smell it, that's how bad it is. Smell's nothing like cigarettes, or food. I smell weed every now and then, but that's not it either.

Long story short, we've told management about it over and over and they won't believe us. It's like they're trying to cover it up or something. Keeps telling us they don't smell it in the morning, and they changed filter and they couldn't find anything on it.

One time we called the cops, at 3 am, officer wouldn't knock on the door, since it was late. And told us to follow up with management. We're going nuts. How could they get away with it like that? And how would you prove it to manager, or they know about it and trying to cover it up?",Addiction
"Hello 25(M)

I have a real problem with cam sites. Since i was 14 years old i started with porn and eventually through an add i started using cam sites. I was just 13 or 14 years old when this happens(wrong) but it is the truth. I spend money on it from time to time. Sometimes a lot and there always was a lot of guilt and shame when i was ?done? then i would quit for a while but for some stupid reason i always come back to them. There are periods in my life i havent used the sites for a long long time( years) but it seems that for some reason i always go back to them in hard times. This problem is coming on and off throughout my life.

I am in a beautiful relationship with the most beautiful girl on this planet. She truly is everything i need. We are lovers, buddys, best friends and all together. We had our ups and downs in our relationships like most people have. Some rough and difficult stuff but we always managed to work things out. After 2 or 2,5 years into the relationship for some reason i came back to those cam sites for the stupid dopamine rush. I feel/felt terrible in those moments after i was done. I tried making stupid excuses to myself that it was just ?like porn? or something familiar. But it really isnt. I dont get it, there is absolutely nothing wrong in our relationship, she is beautiful and im satisfied in every way( emotionally and sexually) we have great sex. It has absolutely nothing to do with her or that there is something missing in the relationship. Yet i still come back to those sites to feel terrible shame and guilt afterwards. To just repeat that again.. i have a history of addiction with substances like marijuana, alcohol and benzos. So addiction is definitely a thing that im dealing and have dealt with in my life. I am completely sober now for a couple of months by the help of some ayahuasca ceremonies and im getting myself together and things are finally going into a very good direction.

Yesterday there was a moment that i felt that i had to tell my lover so i did. She was shocked by it and felt like i have cheated on her which i understand. She was mad, sad, very upset and feels horrible because of it. And it hurts me so much to see her with that pain. To tell her something like this.. she didn?t expected it at all and she feels cheated on. I am so sorry for what i have done. I feel ashamed, terrible, discusted, guilt, grief, sad and so bad about myself. I have told her because ineeded to come clean otherwise i couldn?t live with myself anymore.

She was in complete shock and today on Valentines day she told me she needed to go home and be alone for a while to think things through. I feel horrible, i am afraid that i have ruined the relationship and that she wont be able to forgive me and see it as just a problem i have been having that i developed since i was younger. I feel like i have lost my beautiful girl and i cant live with myself. Although she said she needs time im so afraid that she cant live with this.

I showed her all my transactions of the payments of the camsite throughout the years and it broke her heart seeing that and it broke my heart seeing her react to it like that also.. i just want to move on with her.. i feel lost, hopeless and ashamed.

She is everything for me and i hope she can see it has nothing to do with her or anything like that.. i know one thing for sure. Im quitting that shit for good because i cant live like this anymore..

Can somebody give me some advice for how to deal with this or what to do. Im already sure i wont ever do it again just by seeing what it did to the relationship. But im afraid, lost and hopeless right now. She is everything for me..",Addiction

"I?ve always been very good at hiding things, and my addiction is no different. I?m a great liar, and too proud of it. I?ve been hooked on pills for about a year. I?ve managed to avoid becoming physically dependent on anything because I switch up what I do very frequently, I basically have a rotation of 7 or 8 drugs that I enjoy. Of course I have a favorite, oxy, but I tried to spread things out like I said to not build a tolerance or physical dependence on anything. I thought I ?outsmarted? addiction. I couldn?t possible become addicted, but I recently realized that addiction is a mental game, not a physical one. I have yet to actually face any hard consequences of my abuse, which is another reason I never considered myself ?addicted?.

I am a college student with big plans for the future. I want to go to law school and work in health law. Too many people are getting fucked by the system (but that?s another post). I am doing well in school, 3.7 and making deans list every semester. Scored a 165 on my first practice LSAT. So I know law school is obtainable, but I would be doing even better in school if I quit all the pills.

Currently my biggest problem is that I am an athlete at my school. I have yet to be drug tested because they are random, but I would be absolutely fucked if I was tested. (Though maybe they would assume it?s an error if I tested positive for everything lol.) I don?t even want to think about the consequences of that. For weed, most people just get a warning for the first positive test, but I have heard my school is super strict about anything else. I would likely be cut from the team, and that would be bad for many reasons. Aside from losing the little scholarship money I get (I play a pretty niche sport, so even at the top level we don?t get much money), I would be losing all of my best friends. My team has become my family. I love them with all of my heart and would do anything for them.

My head coach told me at practice yesterday that he noticed that I had lost weight and it was seemingly muscle mass that I lost, and he knows I?ve been in the gym everyday so it didn?t make sense to him. I think he was concerned might I have an ED. I finally came clean to him and told him everything. I told him about my shitty childhood full of abuse, both physical and mental, how my dad hates me for being gay, my suicide attempt, and my drug problems. It felt really good to open up and tell someone something. Like I said, I?m good at hiding things, and because of trust issues, I hide most things from most people. His reaction was better than I ever could have imagined. He basically told me that he?s been in my position before and that he will do whatever he can to help me, and he doesn?t want to get me in trouble, with school or my parents.

We came up with a plan together to help me. Firstly we are going to meet at least once a week and talk, I have to keep him updated. I can call him anytime for any reason. If either of us think I need it at any point, he will arrange professional help. If I show up to practice, team meetings, games, or anything else drunk or high he will make me leave. And if I drink or use the day before or day of a game I will be riding the bench. And biggest of all if I lie to him about any of this, he will have to talk to the school. This may seem way too loose, like he should be making me stop everything all at once, but he knows because he?s been in my position that this is the best starting place, and this is how we will build trust in each other. I know that over time he will tighten up his ?rules? for me. I am so incredibly grateful to him. He treated me with nothing but acceptance, love and respect. He made sure to tell me not to feel guilty or ashamed, and that we will get me through this together.

I don?t think he?ll ever see this, but just in case: Coach K, thank you, I promise I will put the work in, this isn?t how my story ends.",Addiction
" i used to be an asshole for drugs. i orchestrated my entire life around who was fun to do lines with, pop pills and get wasted. i smoked ritalin, dipped cigarettes in codeine, OD?d on benzos and opioids, and made enough cocaethylene in my metabolism to stay drunk for two straight months. my drinks were always strong too. my drink of choice runs about 160 proof. i used to live for the drip in the throat and the feeling of bestial immortality from hitting a line of cocaine. i was introduced to treatment when i went off the rails and crashed my car, lost my job, my relationships, and my sanity all at the same damn time. i urge you if you?re struggling to read what i write here as proof that there is no nobility in drug use. it truly is a better life for me as a sober individual. i won?t speak for others, but i am better at everything i used to only do high, i am able to function emotionally without the weight of guilt and the slow lonely death spiral of drugs and depression that comes with the territory. i feel better than ever and i want to keep going. i never imagined what straight edge was like and i never could, i hope whoever reads this does.",Addiction

"I?m 35. I?ve probably smoked cigarettes for close to 20 years now. A few years ago I got a new car, and refused to smoke in it. Also decided to not smoke at work(I work in a restaurant. You know, where you really only get breaks if you smoke?). The next steps were the bar and home. Covid took care of one of those for long enough for me to not think about it. Then it was just home.

3 weeks ago my partner and I were at a local casino, and we stepped into the smoking area for maybe 15 minutes(he smokes regularly). We stayed the night in the hotel there, and when we got up and got dressed in the morning, my hoodie I was wearing the night before almost made me gag. I didn?t notice it at the time but, that smell was overwhelming.

I haven?t had a cigarette since. For the record I do have an ?On!? brand nicotine pouch in my mouth a few times a day. But, besides that, even with the partner and the roommate both being regular smokers?.the cravings basically don?t exist. It?s crazy to me.

"After 8yrs of meth use I achieved over 3 yrs of sobriety, then over a wk ago I used for 4days.

I don?t have any cravings or nostalgia for using again, I don?t feel like I?ve lost 3yrs nor do I believe that I?ve failed.

I have an understanding of what led me back to that other world and I?m working on how to improve my recovery program and to create a better relapse prevention plan.

I?m humbled by my relapse, it?s a good reminder that no matter how well things are going for me I?m still vulnerable and that I need to respect that vulnerability in myself cause it?s not ever going to go away.",Addiction
"I tell myself that its not like im addicted to something truly detrimental so why do i need to quit?

I need to quit because my lifes going nowhere and it feels like its been on hold since i started smoking. I have no money left as soon as i get some because it all goes on bud and im beyond tired of the cycle.

Im considering going back to inpatient detox because i did it once before and it felt so good to be free. I went because of coexisting mental illness so its safer/easier for me to detox under supervision. My addictions worker is looking into it for me since we had a chat about it last week.

It feels so crazy to have such a dependency on weed and im getting to a point where im ready to say goodbye. I just hope it comes sooner rather than later.",Addiction

"I hate my birthday. The last 2-3 years something really significant and awful has happened on my birthday. This would have been the first birthday I?ve had clean in a long time. I got into my head too much on friday about my birthday and I decided to get some pain killers. I had 7 months, which was significant for me.

I ended up going to work on saturday after I popped way too many and started feeling funny. I got a 2 hour break (working a double) and decided to go home and take more.

My body decided that was too much and I felt like I was about to OD. So I call my friend at work (who is also in recovery) and tell her the situation. She ended up leaving work to drive me to the ER and I obviously didn?t make it for the rest of the shift.

Now fast forward to today, I work in one hour and i?m beyond terrified to go. I?m super anxious because my friend told the managers what happened (they were aware of my recovery) and i?m just nervous if the word got out to the other workers or if i?m gonna get treated different.",Addiction

"I relapsed at the beginning of January; I had 8 mo of sobriety. I knew my life would get fucked up, but this fucked up was unimaginable.

I had a severe lung infection last yr from a combination of smoking dope and asperating due vommitting. They diagnosed it as asperation pneumonia, but it was a very unclear diagnosis. It was so traumatizing, and my fear relapsing this time was it recurring again, it did exactly that. About two weeks ago I asperated, and my lung infection, or, whatever it is, came back full force. I've been to the er 3 times already, and they don't know what's wrong with me, yet again. My O2 levels are extremely low. I can't get any sleep without waking up in the middle of the night and struggling to catch my breath. Constant coughing and wheezing. It's been a nightmare. I'm reliving it all over again.

I'm trying to not smoke dope, but snorting it doesn't really do anything for me, and it feels like dope is the only thing that slightly subsides the pain of this. I'm back to being dope sick again, my tolerance is high and I'm spending all of my money on this shit; I had 1k in savings, which is the most I've ever had saved up in my entire life, now I'm in the negatives. only after 1 month of using. 1 month.

I'm out of work due to this lung infection and also the fear of getting dope sick while at work. I've been at this job for 6 mo and it was the only source of stability that I had. and I'm on the fringe of getting fired.

I admitted to my family I had a relapse, I just wanted to be honest and tell on myself, that was a huge mistake. My family has been so proud of me, they finally had trust in me, they were happy for me, for the first time in years I felt like I had my family back. Now they have lost all trust in me and my recovery. We are barely on talking terms, and when we are it's very awkward and I'm constantly berated with questions and accusations.

My relationship with my partner is slowly falling apart due to both of us using, and our relationship for 8 months of both having clean time was so strong, healthy, and communicative and now it's in fucking shambles again.

My mental and physical health is plummeting. Relapsing was so god damn not worth it. It's crazy that after only a month of using my life is back to where it was 8 months ago. It's true, when you relapse you just end up back exactly where you were, if not worse. This shit is so evil. This drug is so fucking evil. For anyone contemplating relapsing, I really hope you find the strength inside yourself to not do it, to just stay clean and sober for today, for tonight, for the next hour, for the next second. You're worth so much more than this. You can overcome the cravings as hard as it is. it's not worth it. I wish I told myself this before I relapsed, I wish I replayed those fucking tapes. Remember how you felt right before you got sober and why you got sober. It's not fucking worth it for any drug or drink. You'll end up right back to the same place, there's no rock bottom, it can always get worse, and it will. It always does.",Addiction
"I have done it again. I have relapsed.

I recently came to the insight that it wasn't working the way I was using amphetamine once again.

I had to become honest to myself and to my girlfriend that I live with, which is a very hard thing to admit, I think for every addict. I do not want to hurt the people I love and care for.

This is the second time I have to do this here. And it breaks my heart. This cycle has repeated itself with my x as well.

I am tired of this, and I'm tired of myself. But I'm trying not to be too harsh on myself; it's counterproductive.",Addiction
"I can?t believe I am finally writing this. It?s been a long time coming. Long overdue, to say the very least. The last thirty years with you has been one big roller coaster ride. We?ve been through many ups and downs in life.

I could still vividly recall the first time we met. I was 15 years old and in high school. My friends and I chipped in and paid someone to buy you for us. We all drank at Pacific Avenue in Stockton that day. Back then, it was the cool thing to do. I wanted to be one of the cool guys that everyone wants to hang out with. That very first experience with you turned out to be the first of many.

In all my milestones you were there ? high school graduation, first job, first paycheck, first enlistment, first car, first marriage, first child, first home? it was pretty cool that you were there during all those firsts in my life?. man, you truly made a mark!

You were there during the many times I failed: my first divorce, my first foreclosure, my first garnishment? my first grief. You were there by my side when I lost my first love. The most beautiful part of my existence: my mother. She was everything to me. When I lost her, I had also lost a huge part of myself.

Apart from the pain of losing the love of my life, there?s the other kind of pain. Serving in the Army was no easy feat. I had to deal with a lot of stress and trauma. For 24 years, I coped with the physical and mental pain through self-medication. I had to put up a strong face even though I was slowly dying on the inside. I wanted to give up, but I could not stand the disappointment that it would cause my family. So I learned how to fake my feelings, my emotions. It was hard to pretend that I was happy, when I was really this angry, frustrated, lonely person carrying a lot of baggage.

Through all my ups and downs, you were the only constant in my life. You never left my side. You were always there to hold my hand. And I misconstrued that for loyalty, for trust, for love. When all it was was Control. Deception. Betrayal.

I?m not very good with goodbyes. Goodbyes are always painful. But I have to accept that nothing lasts forever. It?s time to part ways, my old friend. Before I close this final chapter of our relationship, let me leave you with one of my favorite Bible quotes: For everything there is a season. A time for every activity under heaven. A time to be born and a time to die. A time to plant and a time to harvest. Ecclesiastes 3:1-8.",Addiction
"I?m not able to post on the subreddit dedicated to this, and nobody has posted in 136 days.

I have kleptomania. Never diagnosed or anything but I think I?m addicted to stealing. I?ve never stolen from anyone I know, never from a small business, never from anyone who would suffer from it. It?s only whenever I go to huge multi billion dollar corporations. But it?s dangerous for myself. I?ve been doing this for years and I don?t know how I?ve never been caught. I need to stop. I have a career. I have a child. I have a partner. And absolutely nobody knows. It feels good to get something for free, it feels like when you just got something on a really good sale. Sometimes it?s personal goods like body wash or eyeliner. Sometimes it may be food. A lot of times, I only do it if I feel like it?s too expensive to justify buying it, but I really want or feel like I need it. For example, I might ?forget? to scan a package of chicken breasts, because all they had was the organic kind and I can?t afford how pricey it is. It?s become so normal for me now that I feel like I?ve been ripped off if I make a big shopping trip and pay for all of this. I need to stop.

"I've only recently realised I'm addicted to coke for real and since a few months already, and now I'm realising no one knows about my addiction. I'm 20, french. Most of my friends don't do drugs and think I do coke sometimes during parties. I actually started doing it alone, to study, and now I just do it for no reason most of the time, alone. My boyfriend often do it with me and is not addicted but he has no idea it's becoming serious for me. Of course my family has no idea and wouldn't be able to understand. Drugs are very taboo in my family, they don't even smoke cigarettes. Everyone sees me as a school nerd, very quiet and ""innocent"" woman which makes it easier to hide, but also makes it more difficult to open up to anyone about it because there will be shock, maybe judgment, and I'm not ready to face it.

"I haven?t been able to bring myself to tell anyone this not even my closest friends.. probably because it is so painful for me to admit even to myself. But I am at a breaking point, I can?t hold it in any longer. My husband has been addicted to fentanyl for 9 months, that I know of. He began two months before I gave birth to my daughter and I found out just a few weeks postpartum. I had suspicions when I noticed the tiny pupils and always tired. Then we suddenly had no money ever and he would leave the house and be gone all day. I discovered a stash of tinfoil needles and cotton swabs and he finally admitted to it after gaslighting me for weeks making me feel crazy. The stress and depression and absolute heartbreak that has overcome me is stronger than anything I have every experienced. I never imagined this could ever happen. He was the best partner and person I ever had the opportunity to love and build a life with. I am crushed and absolutely devastated and I have known for 7 months now. I approached the situation with love and support, took care of him through two bouts of withdrawals, the first time while taking care of my newborn baby too. He has relapsed both times now and continues to lie directly to me about it, no matter how loving and understanding I try to be. I still find tinfoil and baggys in our laundry. I am falling apart witnessing his own self destruction. He actually overdosed when I first became pregnant. Was driving my car and went unconscious behind the wheel. He was arrested and is still on probation from that occurrence. He told me it was laced in marijuana that he smoked and I blindly believed him. At this point I am losing faith in him and I don?t think I will ever be able to trust him again, I fear our relationship is beyond repair. I feel broken and crazy. I love him so deeply and just want this nightmare to end. I miss him so much, he is a ghost of the man he used to be. I know deep down he wants to get better. But the disease of addiction has it?s grip on his body mind and soul. I feel so lost and powerless. The anxiety and fear of him dying haunts me everyday. When-he is asleep I find myself checking to see that he is still breathing. Please pray for us. I don?t want to leave him and have my daughter grow up in a broken family like I did. But I am at the point where I think of what life could be like if I do leave. And I don?t want her to be subjected to his addiction. Staying and witnessing is just too painful. Please pray for us.",Addiction
"He?s been clean of all IV use for 3 years, clean of opiates for a year and a half, and clean from crack for THREE MONTHS!! Even before that he was only relapsing like once or twice a month, which was a HUGE change from 2020 when he was using 200$ worth per day or more.

As for me, I haven?t had a drink or done any hard drugs for all of 2022 so far. My problems with substance abuse definitely are smaller than his? a 14 year habit/lifestyle for him versus me just really doing it in massive binges to Escape (tm) from severe trauma and somehow luckily not getting sucked in to daily use. But still i know it?s an unhealthy pattern for me and I wanted to change so that him and I can be happier and healthier together. :)

I love you guys! Change is possible, your journey to sobriety may be messy and imperfect and marked with relapse but for a lot of people that?s just how it has to be done. Abruptly changing your life is terrifying to your brain and for a lot of people small changes over time work better. If you can?t quit 100% today, do what my BF did and quit IV first. Then work on quitting your most dangerous habit, without worrying about any other ones. Take it a day at a time and treat yourself with honesty and kindness. You got this!",Addiction
"I overdosed Jan 23 on heroin which was presumably fentanyl. No idea how long I was laying there before I received aid. I know I wasn?t breathing, cold, foaming at the mouth etc and stopped breathing after the first and second rounds of narcan. The third one did the trick but i felt so odd afterwards that I could barely walk. Like my body wasn?t responding to my brain. Eventually it wore off but I still needed a wheelchair and ambulance ride. Now I?m finding that I just feel different than before. Like someone else. I?ve forgot how to spell words that used to come naturally to me. I have trouble forming a sentence now. I keep hesitating and then just accepting the sentence as fucked and moving on. It?s hard to explain, but I don?t feel all the way retarded or anything. Then today I looked at my phone and didn?t recognize it. I looked twice and still didn?t recognize it, stared blankly at my screen for a couple minutes before realizing it was indeed my phone. I opened a message and went to reply, mind you I had just used this phone 5-10 minutes before - but didn?t recognize the text style or anything. Now I have a headache. This has to be bad right?

In the last year I?ve managed to dabble in and out with opioids and have continuously overdosed. Even as much as overdosing twice in one day and somehow some way miraculously somebody finds me or saves me just in time. This last overdose was different from all the rest as I didn?t wake up until I was inside the emergency room and I awoken screaming in pain and unable to breathe.

"I (24f) since I was 16 years old have struggled with getting to sleep and staying asleep for longer than 2-3 hours. There are some days/weeks that are good and I sleep well and then I am back to this. At 16 I started self-medicating to help me sleep and I would take literally anything that had a sedative in it: anti-allergies, painkillers, cough syrups. I would never take more than the prescribed amount but I would still take them regularly. I would stop in the middle when I had moments of panic about what I was doing and then I?d go back to it. When I went to university, I start taking clonazepam almost regularly and if I couldn?t get that I would take lexotinal. It really ducked me up and I had a breakdown at one point where I confessed to friends that I felt like an addict, and I abused prescription pills. I have worked really hard on stopping this and have mostly not succumbed except for short periods or where my mental state has been in a place where I need something to put me to sleep. At times I don?t even know if the medicine will help me sleep, I just want to take it and hope that it does.

However, sometimes I?ll see these medicines around or develop random cravings to take them despite not experiencing any issues. I recently started taking levosulpiride again which a doctor had recommended to me sometime ago but the prescription had ended. There?s no reason for me to have started it except that I have had a few bad nights despite having ample time to make up for the lost sleep but I saw the pack and I couldn?t help it and I noticed how all day today all I could think of was planning how to get more once I ran out. I don?t think this is even about getting to sleep anymore.

"I lost my incredible boyfriend in January. He had been sober from fentanyl for 7 months, lived in sober living, attended several meetings every week, was on vivitrol, SSRIs, and saw a therapist every week. From my perspective, he was doing so well. He told me he wasn?t having cravings anymore, that he was feeling really good and happy. He went to visit some family in another state and apparently he was having a really hard time. I say apparently because he didn?t tell me, his family told me later on. He started using again and overdosed and passed away 2 days later. The day of, he had a seizure and was hospitalized, then taken home where he likely used again and passed away. I?m having such a hard time understanding why he continued to try to get high despite being on vivitrol. Maybe I am missing something about how it works?

I just didnt wanna be alive cause its fucking embarrassing. I wanted this to be my own thing to worry about. Not my whole family to know.

"I'm a pretty functional drug addict but a heavy user nonetheless: anything goes, heroin, synthetic opioids, cathinones, meth, MDMA, LSD, weed, synthetic noids, benzos, coke, salvia, LSA, Kratom, you name it... there's barely a day I'm not on something and this has been going on for maybe 15 years with relatively few (yet dramatic) incidents.

But this is rapidly changing, I have been falling in love with a girl I recently met, and even though while things were really uncertain with her my stress caused my drug use to skyrocket, now that we have made some steps that make me think (knock on wood) this relationship could actually evolve to where I so desperately desire it to, that is, that she loves me back, I have all of a sudden lost most of my desire to get high because there is nothing that I desire more in the world than to be able to be with her, healthy and clean, to give to her all of the good things I am capable of giving, cherish her with all of my unadulterated heart and thoughts, and fucking LIVE this life with her, till the end if God permits.

I'm crying like a river writing these lines and no, I'm far from being a teenager experiencing his first love.

I am cleaning my act up as fast as I can. It's not that I could not be honest with her, I haven't told her anything about it but she's such a free spirit with an open mind that I would have no shame it telling her my life's story in details.

It's just that I don't wanna be that person with her. I think I've finally realized that that gaping hole in my heart I was filling up with drugs was that absence of a significant other in my life.

The non physically addictive drugs are already stopped. I think I still need a couple of days, one week tops to get rid of benzos and opiates cuz you know, avoiding to die would be best, but never in my life have I been se motivated to quit.

I'm ready to endure whatever withdrawal has in store for me. That pain, when I think of it as a way to be free to enjoy life with her means nothing at all to me. I'd do anything. Withdrawal, have at me, here I am and here I'll stand, proudly and relentlessly blow after blow until my step is firm and my hands stable.

But that also scares me to death. What if things don't pan out as I hope they will? I've had post break-up depressions in the past that have led me to suicide attempts that nearly succeeded.

Also, I can't help but wondering whether it's that better to become that attached to a person than to a drug. Drugs in my experience are more reliable than people. How will I cope? How will I survive in between ""fixes"" (seeing her, texting her, calling her...). And we all know relationships end one way or the other, with separation or death. So how much better is that really if she leaves me and I just kill myself?

I have to go for more testing over the next few weeks to see how far the damage goes, and what we'll have to do about it. It's a weird feeling, knowing that only after I stop all my drugs is when my body finally starts failing. And it's even weirder that my response to this distress is to want to use/drink again. I know that'll only make it worse, plus it'll ruin what good things have been going on in my life lately. But for years, getting my response to distress was to get wasted. My therapist is helping me learn new coping skills. They do help. But there's a certain pleasure in being so far gone that nothing matters. Until the crash, I guess.

I'm not going back. I've made it this far, I'm not going to throw it all away. I just wanted to say it all somewhere. I haven't told anyone about my liver, yet. I'm waiting for more answers before I tell my friends and boyfriend. I don't want to worry them more than I have to. Maybe the treatment can be all quiet, even. We'll see.",Addiction
I?m 18 y/o male and i just kinda wanted to get it off my chest. i?m a heavy smoker and have been smoking for about 17 months now. My smoking habits have gotten to the point now where i smoke bud/wax every day. i don?t go a day without smoking. if i?m off of work or not in school i usually smoke about every other hour or so when i?m just bored. Smoking doesn?t give me a feeling anymore it just relieves them. i buy a zip of tree every 5 days or so to give u an idea of how much i smoke and that?s with restraint because of how costly this hobby is. I?ve always been awake i suffer from an addictive personality. I am adopted so my biological side of the family were all addicted and ended up pretty bad off to be honest. I?ve been honest with myself that I?ve had issues with weed for a while and i?m trying to cut back. but not i?ve shifted my attention to alcohol. I didn?t really ever drink much while i was becoming a stoner. had alcohol first at 16 then didn?t have it again for a good year after that. but for the past few months i?ve been buying alc more and more and i see myself starting to enjoy it more than weed. The smoking is getting kind of old now to be honest it?s lost all its flair and meaning. Im worrying in the beck of my brain that im becoming an alcoholic. im really embarrassed about my drinking habits and to the excess i do it. it?s 7am rn and im drinking. i usually drink throughout the day when i have alcohol and drink it in consecutive days every week day if i have enough of it. The reason i don?t see it as a huge debilitating issue is because i honestly function fine. I have a lot of mental health problems and some addictions issues but on the outside. you probably wouldn?t be able to tell. also why i think addicts are so misunderstood. But i really don?t want to become a raging alcoholic and this become a problem when i live alone as an adult. I go to school and work a job so im not a bum or anything but i still feel like it?s not normal for me to drink this easily and as much as i am. The alcohol honestly helps with my mental health. it quiets my mind and makes everything more fun. same with weed. my mind is finally at rest.,Addiction

Recently (this week) my fianc left me due to lack of trust . I wasn?t using at the time but I wasn?t honest with her about how I used close to three months before . A week ago on a Thursday I had a seizure and woke up in her bathroom and told her I passed out and was yelling for her help. I told her that I was on drugs . Idk why I told her that I just did apparently on the way to the hospital . I don?t remember the whole day because I had a seizure and forgot. She stayed with me throughout the CT scan and everything . When we got home the next morning . Seizure happened at 10 pm . went to ER and was in ER until 6am . I could tell she was done with me. The most pain I have felt In my life . I love this woman. She?s made me feel normal for a while now. I was so ashamed because I felt like I overdosed . Turns out opiates weren?t in my system . Or heroin . Etc I have been so conditioned to fucked up things I believed it was normal thing to say . It must have been the drugs. I?ve only had one seizure before in my life 6 years prior and was sober then as well. But after ten years of autonomy usage I just figured i did drugs and passed out. The urine panel came back clean and I started questioning deeper things. Why did I jump to saying I did drugs that must have been why I passed out? Why did I say anything about drugs if I hadn?t used in months. Usually my go to is a perk/Roxy . About 3-4 at once . Well I haven?t had them recently. She told me after finding out about a clean urine test if I took a hair test she?d begin to believe me . That?s when I was extremely honest and said well 3-4 months prior I did pills at my fathers house. My dad is an addict / alcoholic and has been since I was 16. (After the divorce he had he turned to substance abuse) I learned to normalize that behavior . The first time I saw anyone do a line it was him. I was 16 and came home for thanksgiving that week. He snorted it and acted somewhat normal(for him at least) then I just thought it was okay. Well if pops does it and is fine I?ll be okay. Well that transformed into more quickly. I went back to va from ms and began selling spice in school. (k2 when it came out) I got expelled that feb and moved back to MS with my dad immediately to get a GED. I didn?t do my first pill til that summer and it made all the pain go away mentally and physically. I loved that shit. 100s of pills later and tens years And fast forward to getting kicked out of my fianc house . She was shocked when I tested clean and told me if I do a hair test she?ll start to gain my trust again and I jumped at the idea of it but then I call her back and express I was scared because the pills from months before might show up. She expresses how it?s not the drugs so much as it?s the lying and trust. I respect her decision and know she was my angel but I have to let her heal . Opiates played such a big role in my life that it sounded normal to say I overdosed even when I was sober. If you?re reading this don?t let pain control you . Fucked up things happen to the best people but don?t let it run your life it ran mine. Pills can?t take this pain away but I?m glad I?m at this point. I?m sober and staying sober . It?s not just going to a meeting it?s going and keep going. I love y?all and I don?t know y?all but don?t let pain run it?s course on you find out how to get rid of it healthily .

"So I?ve been battling it out with Kratom. However at some point in December I turned a corner and decided I?m don?t with my own bullshit (?real change happens when you?re done with your own bullshit?). So I called a school doing something I always wanted to do (software development) and started to get the ball rolling, I changed my work schedule to work well with taking classes and started studying. I stoped smoking cigarettes and decided that I could not study for school if I was smoking weed, it?s hard to study stoned. So I stopped weed so I can always be ready to study and handle my business. Shortly after that I decided I want to feel normal.. like a human, so I?m currently quitting coffee. I realized that after I have coffee I tend to have to reach for kratom to balance myself out? so I would get the ball rolling with coffee then I would HAVE to reach for these other substances to balance myself out? so why not stop ?the source?. I am feeling a lot better and as I mentioned before: I am weening off of kratom (the thing that I have a dependence on). During the morning when I would feel my worse I would automatically reach for it. However a few mornings ago I sat with feeling for awhile and it took about 20 minutes (of hell) but I turned a corner and the ?agony? I felt mellowed out. I didn?t know that would happen. It?s been years since I allowed myself time without that. Currently I?m tapering off and I hope to be 100% off of everything so I can experience what it?s like to be a ?human?.

"So I (24/f) have been struggling with self-harm / addiction for the past 11 years, which includes cutting, poly-substance abuse, and eating disorders. Ive been addicted to cigarettes, cannabis, cocaine, amphetamines, opiates/opioids, benzodiazepines, and alcohol. I think I use substances and use the EDs as another form of self-harm, and as a way to escape the crippling anxiety and severe depression. My father (who I no longer see or speak to) is an emotionally and physically abusive addict. I also have anger issues, which I attribute to him especially.

The eating disorders are related to the substance abuse; I used stimulants to maintain a low weight and getting drunk was the only way I would eat. Then I started drinking so much that I binged my way back up to a healthy weight. I'm still in then normal BMI range, but not that far from being overweight. Now I drink to forget how much weight I've gained.

I've attempted suicide, overdosed countless times, gone through horrible withdrawals, and seen the face of death multiple times. I even had a heart attack, at age 20. Still i suffer with palpitations, and struggle to breathe especially when lying down on my back. I've been to the doctors about this, but they say my vital signs, X-rays, and EKGs all come back fine.

The substances I am currently using include oxycodone and morphine (5-10 mgs a few days of the week), the occasional cigarette, the occasional bowl of cannabis, Adderall (20mg every other day) and I drink alcohol everyday, which I am physically dependent on (something like a 6-pack and bottle of wine) . Some days I'll drink a little less, some days more. But I have to drink consistently the throughout the day to avoid withdrawal. It's incredibly painful.

I recently decided to go back to college for CIS. While I am happy to be in school again, I struggle with math (basic algebra) and my first test is coming up on Tuesday. I fucked off studying last weekend, and now I'm extremely unprepared. I skipped one day of math and two days of art - my only two classes. I feel physically sick from the substance use and my anxiety is so bad, I've been having anxiety attacks every day. Right now I should be studying, but I am so anxious and depressed that I am physically paralyzed on the floor of my apartment.

I miss my mama everyday, but we don't always get along and she lives in another town. I don't have a car so I can't drive to see her. I just got in an argument with one of my best friends the other day - she apologized but I still feel depressed about it. I live with my sister and she is supportive of me - we got in a couple arguments recently as well, but talked it over and are ok now. Now my boyfriend started fighting with me because I didn't know if I want to go to this Blockchain event today, and he knows Im extremely anxious about my math test. He paid for my school and said if I fail this semester I can just try again next semester. He is usually very supportive but today he was upset an saying he doesn't understand why I can't just go to the event. I met someone who says he will help me with math tomorrow, and that is the only hope I have now.

I want so badly to be free from addiction, for so many reasons. I want so badly to be comfortable in my own skin. To be happy and successful, to make my mama proud of me. I feel so lost right now. I've been to rehab a few times, never more than a week. The last one was nice, but they thought I was suicidal (which I wasn't - I only admitted that I had tried to kill myself before) and they kicked me out. Someone please help me, I feel like I'm going to die before I'm even 25. I'm sorry this is so long btw ):",Addiction
"She has seen me at the lowest parts of my addiction many times. We?ve been together 7 of the 12 years I?ve been addicted to heroin/opiates. As well as frequent binges of alcohol. Last month she had to narcan me 3 times to get me back. She thought I was gone already, they had no idea how long I was out. I?ve been to the same detox facility twice as well as two different stays in residential treatment facilities. They were supposed to each be a month long. I left the first facility two weeks in, I had it in my mind I could do it on my own and that I wouldn?t ever use again. I died that same month. I went back to a different place, and didn?t even make it a week before I was kicked out due to a verbal dispute with another client.

I?m back home now and it has only been two weeks since I overdosed. She?s scared. But she also has it in her head for some reason that she?s the main root of my addiction. It?s the complete opposite though. She is the only driving force keeping me from going all out. She just caught me snorting her suboxone after lying to her twice about not having touched it. I?m supposed to start the Naltrexone pill in 10 days and then hopefully get the Vivitrol injection soon after if all is well.

I?m not sure what is wrong with me. I feel like I?m going crazy. It?s not just the anxiety and depression. It isn?t just the suicidal thoughts and self destructive behaviors. It?s not just the marital problems and stress of 3 kids. It?s not just addiction even. I don?t even think it?s a mix - I just don?t want to be sober. Period. I don?t care what it is, I just want to stop feeling this pain mentally and physically. Of course I prefer opiates though. I try to lie and hide it but in the end I?ll do it regardless if I get away with it or not. It?s not that I can?t stop, I just don?t want to stop. I?m not going to stop. I may wait awhile until I can sneak it into my schedule without my life imploding, but that?s the thing. I?ll always just be waiting.

"My addiction is probably not very common but it sure is problematic and ruining my life on a daily basis.

It all started back in September when my friend showed me a musician he found funny. He shows me new songs he finds pretty often and I usually don't like it but this time it was different. The musician in question blew my mind by his humour / the absolute banger that was the song / his unique accent

And it all started from there. Then I discovered all his other songs and I absolutely LOVED all of them. (and i'm usually super difficult when it comes to liking music.

As time went by , I kept falling further and further down the rabbit hole :

listening to all the interviews I could find, reading about him, learning every little thing I could to the point it was basically stalking his personnal life.

I even started a fan youtube account to archive all his interviews available online / performances/old content ( the guy isn't THAT famous , basically an up and comer from where I live so he even found out about the account..I was ashamed) .

Then, after a few weeks, it got worse. I discovered that the guy streams a few times a week on twitch. Guess who has watched EVERY SINGLE STREAM since september ?

Then I discovered he has a discord server where's he's super active with his fanbase.My addiction started to get way worse at this point since I could basically interact with him whenever I wanted.



So yeah,that's my problem right there. Since september, I only want to listen to his music and nothing else. I watch all his streams even when they last more than 5 hours.i'm.always.there.

All my spare time revolves around him to a certain point.I'm gonna go see him in concert 3 times this spring.

I hate myself for being that addicted. I have to distance myself from all of this. but at the same time.. it gives me so much joy. What have I become ? It's pathetic.

I promised myself to stop watching his streams from now on. Maybe watch some aftwerwards when he's offline ?

I promised myself to almost never post on his discord anymore and to not meet him when i'll see him in concert this spring.

For his music, i'll keep listening to it as it's not that much of a problem.

I originally wanted to go visit his hometown this summer since it's an absolutely beautiful small town by the ocean. but maybe I shouldn't..

Anyway. One day at a time. Crossing fingers that I can become just a regular casual fan , enjoying his music without getting so emotionaly attached.

Also, this is a throwaway account since I post sometimes about him on reddit and you could easily find who it is,so..",Addiction

This went on for a while, but unfortunately my knee wasn't feeling any better, even after several months of therapy and several rounds of pain medication. Eventually I was referred to an orthopaedic consultant, who agreed I needed an MRI to see what was going on. The results of the MRI showed that I had torn cartilage in my knee and had also partially torn one of the main ligaments. The consultant suggested the best option for me was to go on the waiting list for surgery, which was around 1-1.5 years long at the time. I was happy to wait, as it had already been a few years of doctors? appointments, physiotherapy sessions and painkiller prescriptions ? and I thought the extra wait would be fine.

During the wait for the surgery, the pain seemed to get worse. I had stopped seeing the physiotherapist, as the consultant now knew that no amount of strengthening would fully ease my pain. However, I found the pain to increase after stopping. I went back to my GP, who was then able to prescribe Co-Codamol 30/500, double the dose I had previously been on, because by that stage I was over 18 years old.

Quickly I found myself becoming dependent on this medication. They helped my pain, but I can?t lie - I also enjoyed the way they made me feel. I would finish the prescription within 2 weeks, rather than 4, and top myself up with over-the-counter Co-Codamol, until it was time to get another prescription from my GP. This became a bit of a cycle for me - prescription, OTC, prescription, OTC....and so on.

I finally got the surgery in 2015 aged 20, yet the pain remained. I kept seeing my GP, who kept prescribing the medication and I kept taking it quite happily. I was extremely depressed during this time of my life. I had gained a lot of weight and I hated the way I looked. The only thing that made me feel good was the buzz I got when I took some type of codeine-based medication.

Eventually I started buying Dihydrocodeine, a strong codeine-based painkiller, from online pharmacies. I would get into a cycle where I was taking codeine for several weeks and then taking a break for a week or two. In my mind, the fact that I was able to stop for short periods meant I wasn't addicted.

I told myself that my ability to stop every so often meant that I didn't have a problem for a further 5 years until I completely lost control.

In March 2020, I found myself catching covid at work. It hit me pretty hard, and I ended up with pneumonia, pleurisy, and countless other chest infections which kept coming back every time I thought I was beginning to recover. The pain across my back from all the inflammation in my chest was agonising, and I took that opportunity to get more painkillers from my GP. They did help, but I had developed quite a high tolerance over the years and their effectiveness quickly diminished.

I started going back to pharmacies, sometimes up to 4 in one day, buying more and more codeine-based products. I was constantly thinking about which pharmacies I hadn?t used recently, which I had, and which ones I could use to avoid any suspicion. I would constantly lie about where I was going, just to get some pills.

I would also use online pharmacies to buy the stronger prescription only medications that I craved. I made accounts with several of these sites, did the health assessments for them all, and happily paid for my prescription to be delivered to my door. This then opened the door for me to start looking for other medications online.

After a month or two of lockdowns and isolation, I found that codeine was no longer enough for me, and I started looking into buying diazepam and other benzodiazepines online. This sent me into a complete downward spiral, as I was buying any pills I could get my hands on, from any sources available. This (most of the time) meant that I was receiving pills from India, which were more than likely completely fake.

I was also drinking quite heavily during this time ? an extremely dangerous thing to do when you?ve been taking upwards of 30 pills a day. On one occasion, a friend had to come to my house and almost pull me out of the hot tub. I had taken a handful of pills (a mixture of codeine & benzodiazepines) and then started drinking cocktails for the afternoon. We had been texting throughout, but when I suddenly stopped responding, she naturally became extremely concerned. She arrived to find me almost passed out in the hot tub by myself with a drink in my hand. That was probably one of my lowest points to date. But it wasn?t enough to stop me.

On another occasion, I remember waking up and finding 4 diazepam remaining in one of the sleeves I had received in the post on the previous day. There were 60 diazepam in total, and only 4 remained. I had taken 56 of them the night before (alongside a lot of alcohol) and had absolutely no recollection of doing so. To this day I still don?t know if I did this on purpose and that terrifies me. I have overdosed on numerous occasions in the past, but never on purpose. Never for a reason. So to think that I was possibly in a place where I may have purposely overdosed to end my life is one of the scariest thoughts I have.

By the Summer of 2020, I was just a shell of the person I used to be. My own mother barely recognised me, which is still a painful thought to this day. When I was eventually sat down in July for the final time and told my behaviour needed to stop, I took action. Admitting I had a problem was one of the hardest things I had to do, but I?m so glad that I did. Up until that point, I had denied any allegations of substance abuse and completely ignored any help or advice that was given to me. This time was different. Things needed to change.

I went back to work and did my best to resist any temptations to go back to my old ways. I stopped benzodiazepines almost immediately, then I worked on giving up the painkillers, then cut down on alcohol a few weeks later. I suppose I was lying to myself at the time about my alcohol consumption too, but I eventually got that under control (one battle at a time, am I right?).

From March-July, I was in a very dark place. I can safely say that I absolutely hit rock bottom and then kept going. I don?t know how much longer I would have survived if I didn?t have the family and friends that I do. Everything I did during that time should have pushed them away, but they stuck with me though it all and I?m extremely grateful to them for essentially saving my life.

As of today, I have been clean of benzos for 581 days and codeine-based pain meds for 568 days. I do still drink alcohol, but I?m happy with my consumption these days. I had a lot of underlying mental health issues which accelerated my alcohol consumption back then, but these have now been acknowledged and addressed, and I can safely say that I now enjoy a drink in moderation in a social setting only. I don?t wake up with shame and regret anymore ? just a content feeling of a night well spent, and I think that?s something I can really be proud of.",Addiction

"hope everyone has been well, I wasn?t sure where to post this, but considered others here would understand. So long story short I have been clean for sometime yet struggle with many things, one of the big things is I often have been use to being in a zone(being high) to get things done. That being said I find my motivation and discipline have suffered a lot and need a lot of work. For those that have given themselves time to heal and overcome these challenges and more what steps or recommendation would you offer. I often barely move unless I feel it, and that can be in many forms whether it be caffeine, the wakeful energy from just waking up.

"Hey I'm 18 years old and I think that I am slowly but surely getting addicted to online gambling. It all started with my friends boasting about how they won 30$ on live blackjack. I was intrigued and wanted to see if I could win too so I started putting in 10$ every now and then.

The problem started when I would keep winning more and more money. I never left a single session without getting my money back. My sessions went from 10$ every now and then to 20$ every weekend. Then about 3 weeks ago I lost my shit and decided to put 140$ into live casino one night, once i lost that amount I had decided to put in another 80$ cause i wanted to win everything back. Then to my surprise I win 1600$ and i told myself that I'd never gamble again, cause a win that big will never happen again.

Ofcourse a couple weeks later I get back into it, and today I won another 100$. I don't know what to do now, I really want to gamble cause I haven't lost yet. Its just so easy to hop on some live casino when I'm bored. I think that I have to stop before I go down a road that I'll regret.

"Hey so yeah question is pretty clear but I still wanna use this post as a vent. I'm not that deep in addiction that I would be using every day I don't need it and I don't want it cuz getting high day before work is not the best thing to do. Last Sunday I decided that I'll be clean till end of the month and I made this decision because I got drunk and I was driving and I didn't slept for a day and I was falling asleep on a highway and I almost ended up out of the road. I almost died just because I told myself that I'll be clean but I didn't know that I can't drink either I thought I can handle it. But I didn't and because I was really drunk my only thoughts were that I really need to get high. I never felt like this, this was first time that I really 'needed' it. Tbh I wasn't scared that I could die it's just not that big deal but at that moment I realized that my problem is bigger then I thought. After that I was clean and sober for 6 days but then weekend came again and we were having few drinks with coworkers. I always knew how to drink and I never really got that drunk but that weekend I just wanted to get drunk asf because the whole week without drugs I was just sleeping and I couldn't find motivation to go ti the shower or clean my room. So I did the same thing except for the fact that I don't remember my way to the party where I went and after party I couldn't find my car and when I found it I had a flat tire. That was this Saturday and on Sunday I was like 'Im really gonna stay clean till end of the month.' But Monday was terrible I wanted to get high so much but I just went to sleep. Tuesday was even worse my work is just pissing me off every day and I even texted my plug but he didn't had time. Yesterday was another terrible day so I just bought 2g of speed just so I can clean my room yk. I wanna get clean but on the other hand I don't wanna. I probably have some mental health issues but I don't have anything diagnosed but I just can't find the motivation for anything. In my job I'm working normally but when I get home it's so hard for me to get up from bed and really do something. So almost every time I need to do something I just do some speed cuz it's easier. I just don't know what to do or I know it but I don't really wanna do it. How do I stay clean and actually function in normal life? Do I need to stay clean for longer time and does it really get better? Because I don't believe in it anymore I was clean for 16 days and I could have been fine but I moved to another country alone and I fell into depression and then started with drugs again.

It seems to have helped me analyze my anxiety inducing thinking patterns which is perhaps beneficial.

"I gave up these badboys when I was 30, in that I gave up smoking it all day, every day. But then I was drinking and eating (like a monster) then too - and just very unaware of any of my coping mechanisms, (pre autism & adhd diagnosis & general self discovery on the next level...)

I've curbed it all now, finally, at 33, except I had a bit of an emotional meltdown in November and smoked for a good six weeks, came off after Christmas, then my grandma immediately went into hospital and then died at the end of January, so I kinda just carried on smoking almost constantly and HEAVILY for three months.

I've been smoking these ungodly amounts and have known it was going to really sling me into a bad, bad place when i stopped... and we are here now. I'm done again because I can't do it in moderation, my lungs are absolutely fried before I even manage to get a hit after say the fourth or fifth joint. Its expensive and unsustainable and doesn't align well with my current spiritual values. Weed blew me wide open and changed so much, but that use became abuse and I just needed to move forward.

Anyway what i am really here for is possibly, hopefully reassurance from people who understand.... Addiction is just the hardest thing I've ever, ever, ever dealt with. Trauma as a child, then the double whammy of autism ritual joy and then adhd emotional management and all that comes with that... it makes things utterly impossible to do like a normal person. I don't have any addicty friends these days and am really struggling to speak to someone who gets it....

So now of course I'm totally raw and feeling everything. I slept for 2 days straight, and coming out of that I managed to have a great session on the drums and a big walk, however, I'm on day 3 now I think and I just feel absolutely, absolutely terrible, mentally and emotionally?

I'm functioning and flowing through life like a melancholy ghost but irritable beyond belief, of course all the usual silliness of withdrawal, but then there's the existential dread that is just making me feel like a perpetually short fusing circuit that's about to be sucked into a black hole.

It's clawing away at me through my upper back, I feel panicky, just, this complete existential, awful, terrible, just terrible, terrible feeling....

Smoking will make it all go away but then it will come back worse, so I can't possibly prolong the inevitable any longer...

Please god, is there anyone out there with some grounding, earthing, reassuring, understanding, motivating words to help me through this. I can't remember how long this lasts... am I going to be okay??

I have found a program that will help me with all of my issues all at once and it looks like a very good opportunity, and it's one that not a lot of people get to experience because again our system is so messed up that people are on a waiting list for years and years.

How do I tell my mom that I'm going to an addiction centre? I know how my mom is and she is going to be shocked and she is going to worry so much and I'm also afraid of her judgement to be honest. She's a very sweet woman but I just don't know how she will take the news.

If anyone has gone through this before having to tell someone about getting help for addiction, I would really appreciate any advice or insight. Thank you.",Addiction
"I just wanted to introduce myself and get some advice on starting a recovery journey. I have bipolar disorder type 2 and I've finally found a combination of medications that worked for me. However, after a significant life event, I started using to cope with the pain. For a while, weed and alcohol were enough to numb the pain and take me out of reality. Eventually, my tolerance became so high that weed no longer helped me disassociate, so I turned to DXM.

The day before yesterday, my mom found me completely out of it after I'd taken a double dose with grapefruit juice to increase the intensity. I couldn't tell her how much I'd taken because I couldn't remember. She was so scared that I was overdosing. I decided to be open and honest with her and after a hellish night and morning after, I decided that I really wanted to improve and get clean.

So that's why I'm here. I'm going to get into an intensive outpatient treatment program and lean on her to support me through the start. Any tips to set me up for success?",Addiction
Avid cocaine addict and alcoholic here. I just got home from 20 days of my first time in treatment and doing my best to not think about the money I now owe.

"No matter if I'm the richest, most powerful person on the planet or I'm the poorest son of a bitch living under a bridge, the end outcome is the same. Death. I find it extremely difficult to even try other than working enough for shelter, food, clothing. I can't understand the saying it is better to have love and lost, then to have never loved before. Bullshit. I have loved and lost and I fucking hate it. They say oh but what about the memories? Fuck the memories. I think about the memories every god damn day. I have dreams of dead friends. I wake up happy for one second then remember that they'll gone forever. I go back home and drive past the memories and I hate it. This life is so fucking insane. I stay home until I have to work. I work then come home. I order drive through or take out. I keep my head down and my hood up. Why take the chance of meeting someone if there's a possibility of them leaving you. I made some friends and all I did was try to compare them to past friends. You know what it didn't work. Theres so much tragedy and sorrow in this world. Addiction with me is like a blanket pulled off my head. I see the world for what it really is. A big pile of shit. You're born, you live, and no matter what you do or don't do you fucking die. Either you're a disappointment or you dissapoint someone else. No amount of drugs or mental health care could ever fix this problem for me. I already know what's at the end of the light. I can't help myself form thinking logical. Their are rules of science and nature that back up my feelings on life. Their is no God. No heaven or hell. No anything after you die. You just fucking die. You go day to day not knowing when, but you know in you the back of your head that today could be today. I can't understand people. How is it possible that more people don't feel this way? How are they happy? Why are they happy? Even people worse off from me are happy. That have lost more than me are happy. I don't get it.",Addiction
"For background information, I?m a 19-year-old girl who?s diagnosed with ADD (same thing as ADHD minus the hyperactivity). I?ve been taking prescription Adderall since I was about 12 years old. Mind you, despite how over-prescribed Adderall supposedly is, it was something I definitely needed at the time. I had a traumatic event happen to me as a child involving my father (who was addicted to painkillers and alcohol), and I believe the trauma has something to do with my ADD because I started showing symptoms shortly afterwards, though I didn?t get medicated for it until years later. Also, I got diagnosed with PTSD and anxiety as a direct result of the trauma.

I know Adderall is a controlled substance that can lead to addiction, which is why I?m seeking answers about this. I can?t tell if what I?m going through is an addiction or not. Let me explain:

After being prescribed Adderall at age 12, I took it normally and consistently (once a day throughout the 5-day school week). I had a much easier time focusing in class and my grades improved significantly. This was the case up until I was about 15 years old, when my doctor suggested that I start taking Adderall twice a day (once in the morning, once in the evening). I started to realize how much I liked the way Adderall made me feel. Whenever I took it, it made me feel like I was capable of doing anything I put my mind to. I?d pull all nighters and spend the entire night sketching, writing, or doing anything productive, all while I popped more pills than I was supposed to take. There were times where I?d take 5 pills a day. At that point, I was also at the peak of my eating disorder (anorexia nervosa), and frequently I?d take Adderall just to get rid of my appetite. It made me lose a lot of weight.

The reason why I?m not sure if this is an addiction is because when I eventually had to stop taking it so often, I couldn?t tell whether my symptoms were from withdrawal or simply normal side effects of coming down from the medication. After spending so many days and nights on it, spending a day without it was just?exhausting. I?d be fatigued, irritable, and sometimes feel physically ill the entire day. There was a time where I binged on Adderall for nearly 48 hours, then I finally went to sleep around 3 a.m., and woke up at 8 p.m. later that same day. That long crash was most likely due to how sleep deprived I was in general, but I?ve crashed for extensive periods after taking Adderall when I wasn?t necessarily sleep deprived before.

Another thing that convinces me that this might be an addiction is already having an addictive personality, and being predisposed to addiction due to how much it runs in my family, including my father. This is what worries me the most.

Would anybody be able to tell me if it sounds like I?m addicted to Adderall or not? I realize it probably sounds like a stupid question, but drug addiction is very serious and I want to make sure I?m not blowing it out of proportion before I reach out for help. Please don?t hesitate to be honest, this is something I really want to know so I can figure out how to approach it when I talk to my loved ones about it.",Addiction
"I was asked this last night at a convenience store. I was buying 2 sugar free Dr. Peppers and a pack of chocolate twinkles to go with my 2 one foot long steak sandwich and loaded french fries. I was going home to gorge myself and then go right to sleep. I love eating big meals then going to sleep. I know it's not healthy, but I do it anyway. I prefer to eat a lot before sleeping. I don't care if it fucks up my body. I don't care if my teeth fall out. I just don't fucking care. Maybe if I told the gas station clerk this, maybe next time I come in she won't ask me to smile. She'll know that I have nothing to smile for. I have no reason to smile. I'm going home to stuff my face with thousands of calories and tons of fat and cholesterol. I never smile. Life isn't something I smile at. People aren't something I smile at. I go through life with a deep dark bottomless expression on my face. No one talks to me and I don't talk to anyone. Just trying to get though this as fast and efficiently as possible. I work nights because of this. You can't see me, and I can't see you. I leave the lights off on my off airport parking shuttle bus until I have to put them on. People get on my bus and start talking about their trip. I shut those fucking lights off. Everyone goes quite. I don't turn the lights on until I reach the off airport parking lot. I hurry around back to get the luggage off before the people get there. I keep my head down and my hood up. I keep my sunglasses on as long as I can. I try to have as little human interaction as humanly possible. Just give me my tip or not and leave. Actually I don't care if I get tip. If I get a tip I feel obligated to talk. To say thank you. At least if you give me nothing, I will have no reason to go further with the interaction. Coworkers want to spark up conversations. I know I can't just not respond. I say the most fucked up off the wall work appropriate shit I can think of. A guy ask me about some pizza place up the street. Asked me why it's never open. Askes me if I've ever been there. I say yeah I've been there to buy heroin. End of conversation. What can he say? He can't even ask if I'm joking because I say it straight face and act dead serious. Younger coworkers ask me questions. I go into a life sucks then you die rant. The only peace is when you die. You die and have no worries. Bills , work, family obligations, society obligations all gone. You just fucking die and thats it. I say this dead seriously with a straight face. Then the deathly silence takes over. Minutes pass and nothing else is said. The young coworkers just sit there and think of a response, but can't think of anything. They know I'm right. They know that there generation is fucked. 20 years old and in college for some bullshit degree. Working at a off airport parking lot for extra beer money. Happy go lucky until I start to talk. It's beautiful. The hopes and dreams are rushed away at a blink of a eye. They realize that I'm right. I walk out of the office to my van in the parking lot. I leave them with there thoughts. I go on another trip to the airport. I drive back and forth over and over again. 10, 11 hours a night. I radio on the cb to the dispatcher. No more glee in their speaking. No more friendly banter or chit-chat. I hear the nothingness in their voice over the radio. I'm not trying to make these people depressed and without hope. It just comes extremely natural to me. Customers are happy they're going on vacation and try to talk to me about it. I hear the happiness in their voices. It's a 10 minutes ride to the airport. 10 minutes is all I need. They get off the bus still happy, but not without wondering. Wondering if that bus driver will still be alive when I get back. Thinking that how can he not be as happy as I am. I'm going vacation, why not spread my joy to everyone I can before I reach my final destination? No. Not on my shift. You're trying to make me feel your excitement is having a negative effect on me. The more you try to talk to me about how happy you are, the more I'm trying to derail you happiness. I drop them off and radio in to dispatch. I hear no happiness or excitement. I give no happiness or excitement. I return to the off airport parking lot. This goes on for the next 9 hours.",Addiction

"A close family member has been in an on off relationship with a guy who is a poly drug user for over a year.

During the time together she has 'willingly' given him a fairly sizeable portion of her income. She has helped to support him through his drugs issues and has on occasions been assertive with him about not wanting her home turned into a crack den. He had predominantly been smoking crack and they had split due to his not being able to have sex(weak erection, no pre cum, little desire) buy had remained close.

Last night she called to say that he was threatening, out of the blue, to delete her number and return her belongings because of something she had done which he wouldn't elaborate on and that he seemed to be on a crack withdrawal or had taken benzos. When this happens her resolve to help him crumbles and she will buy him a new mobile or replace whatever belonging he has had which he has managed to 'lose' or break (read sell) and/or will self harm and spend money on him (often well in excess of what she can afford).

This behaviour seems to be cyclical ie. the last time it happened was before their split where he had said he couldn't see a future for the two of them as there had been too many 'problems' and he had lost his taste for the relationship. This resulted in my family memeber self harming in his presence and then purchasing a large quantity of cigarettes and a mobile phone which resulted in him agreeing to remain friends for life.

In recent days he has been threatening to end the friendship and my relative has admitted to trying to stall things by transferring nearly 500 pounds into this guy's account. He has stated that his friendship cannot be bought but appears content to hold onto the money which amounts to nearly 3/4 of a month's wage.

My relative is well versed in addiction and addictive personalities and understands that the drugs have replaced his personality but she is unable to find a way out in part because he is the sweetest most attentive person for weeks on end and then all of a sudden there will be some trivial reason for which he needs to cut her out of his life for good which results in her desperately trying to buy him back into her life on whatever terms he wants.",Addiction

"(22 F) I hear a lot of people say they have an ?addictive personality? and I?d definitely identify with that label. Anytime I?ve used drugs I?ve gotten hooked and wanted to do them always. I find I can?t even start smoking weed or else it quickly becomes a daily thing that I rely on. I have friends who?ve done more addictive chemicals but they don?t respond to them in the same way I do. I get hooked on ideas and can?t stop thinking about them. Right now it?s drugs, in particular Adderall (not prescribed), shrooms, and nicotine. I want to try others but my addictive tendencies have shown that when I introduce a new compound into my life it feels like it?s just one extra thing I have to work to not abuse.

Even just nicotine I?ve watched my friends casually vape which I took too far and felt like my lungs were giving out everyday so I switched to pouches and Nicorette mints. What I deem addictive tendencies become apparent when I purposefully use drugs like nicotine and Adderall when I have no food in my system just to maximize the dopamine rush. I also crush up the Nicorettes into powder because I want it to get absorbed as quickly as possible to feel something. I love bingeing and once I start I can?t stop. Is this just the nature of being 22 years old? Do I need to engage more work than others to steer clear from substances? My father is an alcoholic and I see a lot of myself in him. We both have ?ticks? that we have never been able to kick like head picking and mouth biting. I found I always take it too far though. My dad just bites the inside of his mouth like he would biting his nails but I do it in a way where I hunt for the most painful parts and bite there and then my mouth is full of blood. And I can?t stop when I start.

All this to say, I feel shameful about my addictions to things that feel normal to others. I have an insane job in tech and a degree and work in the creative industry and I see so many people using Adderall and nicotine and caffeine and other substances unhealthily just to make a name for themselves and as a workaholic artist having unhealthy addictions almost makes it feel like I?m living the part. I don?t even know if I want to quit. I?m really curious about other drugs like MDMA and painkillers but I?m scared they?d really ruin me. Most of my friends are very straight edge so I feel alien when I talk about drugs which is a good thing I suppose that theres no external pressure to participate. I?m super stressed these days and in the dumps emotionally and it feels like I?m always just waiting for the next time I use a pouch or take shrooms or Adderall to make days less boring.

In the process of writing this I realized I should probably just go to therapy but if anyone relates or has knowledge or advice it?d be greatly appreciated.",Addiction

With strict adherence to my program and a lot of therapy, I do abstinence very well. I don?t really even have cravings anymore. However, as many addicts do, one of the first things that I did early on was replace my use with sweets. I gained a good 30lbs in less than 6 months. I was told by my doctors about a month ago that I am at serious risk for diabetes and I have tried to go on a diet, but with food you can?t just? stop eating. Not if you want to live.

I switched to sugar free energy drinks, cut out sodie pop entirely, stopped buying garbage like Taquitos and pizza rolls and ramen (I may be 34 but I was drunk for 15 years I am a giant baby) and started getting crystal light and stevia chocolates so I had SOMETHING. But lately, I?ve been noticing that when I?m stressed and all the healthy food I have is a whole cooking process I am prone to just run to the store and get a frozen pizza or order Chinese or worse Taco Bell or even run to the corner store and constantly get lemonades and shit for a treat cause it?s not pop and it?s happening more and more frequently and I?m making excuses for myself and being sneaky trying to lie to myself almost and it feels JUST LIKE ACTIVE ADDICTION and it?s scary.

"The stigma of addiction in America and lack of understanding is so frustrating. Its 2022, and tons of people still believe addiction is a ?choice? or a ?moral issue?. Science has shown addiction to be a brain disease and chemical imbalance for over 2 decades.

The common belief is that ? drugs are the cause of addiction?. That?s just not true. Drugs are a symptom of addiction, but not the cause. Addiction starts long before drugs are introduced. Most addicts have been seeking some form of dopamine and seratonin rush since a child (sex, food, video games, excercize).

So why can normal people drink with moderation or do coke once a year and not think about it again, while addicts ruin their lives with them? Because of the chemical imbalance and brain disease an addict has dealing with pleasure. 9/10 addicts use to self medicate.

For the past 3-4 years I've had trouble sleeping so the first year I began taking Benadryl or Tylenol PMs at night. Then it led to sometimes drinking alcohol after taking meds with Diphenhydramine to give me a quicker sedative/sleepy feeling. Then after 2 years I wound up getting a medical marijuana card thinking I could stop using those first two methods to help sleep and just use weed to help me sleep. But after a few months of just smoking weed it turned into a combination of all three things. Some nights its just Diphenhydramine and weed and I do my best to stop drinking for a couple weeks. And other nights I drink and smoke and don't take Diphenhydramine. Some nights I do take all three. I?m not sure how to go about getting help because it's hard to tell my family.

"There are tons of people across the globe that smoke or snort heroin. While some inject the same in their veins which is eventually a more dangerous way for taking this illicit drug! Honestly, whether you snort, smoke, or inject, heroin can quickly get to your nervous system. Apart from this, it is easy to overdose and gets depended on no matter if you have used it once or twice.

There are plenty of reasons why heroin is illegal. Heroin is known for numbing your body from experiencing pain, it slows down your heart rate, and when misused, there are possible chances of getting cardiac arrest. These days, tons of adults have started using Heroin to get rid of anxiety attacks, stresses, and plenty of other things such as experiencing euphoria, etc.

"When the pain becomes intolerable, some doctors prescribe Vicodin. It is a prescription painkiller developed to provide relief to patients with moderate or severe pain. It is made up of opioid pain relievers and non-opioid pain relievers. In other words, it contains Hydrocodone and Acetaminophen. The Hydrocodone present in Vicodin is a synthetic opioid, which activates the same neurotransmitter as heroin.

Vicodin tablets come in three different dosage levels of hydrocodone- 5 mg, 7.5 mg, and 10 mg. Each of the Vicodin tablets contains 300mg to 325 mg of Acetaminophen. Generally, it is prescribed to be taken a single tablet, after every 4-5 hours. When taken for a long time, it can have a habit-forming effect.

What Vicodin Addiction is

Vicodin is currently labeled as a schedule II controlled substance according to the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) after being removed from schedule III in October 2014. Since the additional potential of Vicodin was so high, the DEA tightened the restrictions in order to prevent fraud and to ensure the safety of the citizens who can get addicted to it.

The addiction to Vicodin includes every type of use without a prescription. One of the results of Vicodin addiction is liver damage or failure. Severe cases of liver damage, involve the dose of 4000 mg or more of Vicodin or Acetaminophen in a single day.

Effects of Vicodin Addiction

Every addictive substance comes with side effects, so Vicodin too has side effects. The most common side effect of it is liver damage. Some of the other side effects of the Vicodin include:

 Drowsiness

 Dizziness

 Relaxed and calming experience

 Light head

 Constipation

 Decreased breath rate

 Depressed heart rate

 Aches and cramps

 Nausea vomiting

 Muscle pain

 Depression

Vicodin Addiction?s Symptoms

It is tough to identify the addiction to Vicodin most of the time. Because most people don?t realize that they are getting dependent on it. They realize when they stop taking it.

In order to diagnose the substance use disorder, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder (MSM-5) outlines some criteria. To diagnose, a person needs to meet two or more of the corresponding criteria within 12 month period. When a patient meets two or three criteria, he may have a mild substance use disorder. On the other hand, meeting four to five criteria are considered moderate and six or more is for the severe substance use disorder.

Some symptoms of Vicodin addiction are mentioned below:

 Taking Vicodin in larger amount or longer than prescribed

 Want to cut down the dose but not able to manage

 Taking more time getting, using, or recovering from the use of Vicodin

 Strong urge to use Vicodin

 Not able to concentrate on work, home, or school.

 Giving up on important occupational, social, or leisure activities

 Development of withdrawal symptoms

Vicodin Addiction Treatment

The most effective treatment can be provided by professionals only. Vicodin addiction treatment includes therapy and support in an environment that is specially created for recovery. It becomes more effective when patients join support groups and learn from the stories of others about how to sustain a drug-free life.

An expert?s supervision helps them recover fast as compared to patients without direction and supervision. If you have a close relative or friend who is dealing with Vicodin addiction, you can save their life by seeking professional help.",Addiction

"Do any of you have any weird or unusual smoking habits?

For example, when I smoke a pipe, I always squint my eyes or close my eyes so that they are almost closed, because I smoked some white/crack before, and it spit into my eye and hurt my eye, and I've had that happen a few times, so since then I squint my eyes...

I also have a similar habit, where instead of squinting both eyes, I close just my left eye when smoking...

Anytime I took MDMA, I'd ALWAYS have to spend a little while looking at myself in the mirror. I'd ALWAYS have to stroke my dogs, everytime without fail

I never really had any habits when I used to smoke weed, and weed was my main drug of choice, beginning at 14 and smoking for 10 years... Only habit I really had with weed is that if I get paranoid when I'm stoned, I'll always eat something, and whether it genuinely helped or was just psychological, this would always stop my paranoia

The only other sort of habit I had when smoking weed was that I'd always go for a late night drive around 1-3am, listening to music and also star gazing and sky watching, looking for UFOs.. I only really did this for a few years though as my partner at the time had a car and because I don't drive and neither does my partner, I can't do that anymore ..

And it's not so much a drug related habit, but I have to smoke 3 fags, one after the other before I go to sleep

"I just wanted to pour my heart out somewhere. I'll try and keep it short.

I'm 21 yo. I have been addicted to porn since i was 13. It took me 7 long years to realize what this addiction has done to my life.

I have been trying to quit this addiction of PMO (Porn masturbation and orgasm) for like 2 years but i keep failing.

The ""Trying to quit"" period made it even more worse by not being able to focus on anything which resulted in the following -

1- Went from 0 to 15 failed exams in college.

2- Freelance career ruined due to my inability to committ towards any tasks consistently.

3- Depression and suicidal tendancy out of regret of not being able to quit.

4- My startup still remains a dream due to lack of funds.

5- I left my Girlfriend cause i couldn't deal with her drama along with all these existing problems.

6- I don't have any friends nearby. My college is in another state and I live with my parents who are emotionally abusive.

7- Social life ruined.

Extra - I have had a horrible childhood. Toxic father and being bullied at school with no friends were few of it. I was also mocked for my physical condition at school which resulted in my low self esteem. (I have seizures and stuff)

Basically I'm getting used to feeling like shit every time i relapse. For those who are about to advise tips on quitting, don't.

I have tried everything there is to quit, but like any hardcore addict, staying at home idle triggers the dopamine needs which fuels the urge to relapse.

So currently i plan to hit the gym and be busy with activities at college as much as possible. The goal is to never stay idle.

But at the moment, I'm stuck at home with this toxic habit and feeling suicidal and depressed both at the same time.

I don't need any advice. I'm aware of the ways to get out this loop of suffering. I'm just not in a situation to act accordingly.

If you read this far, thanks for listening to my tragic story..

I feel confident with my substance abuse now and am not worried about relapsing, but during my time using I destroyed my family (have two kids) and ruined my career, I am now at the point where I have my own apartment again and have managed to get my self a motorcycle but am living on benefits and honestly have no idea what to do now, I'm nearly 40 years old and have no prospects I have gaps in my employment and so would not know how to address this in an interview, I dont think saying I had to have time out to get over a crack and heroine Addiction would go down to well, so what I would like to know is how did you guys rebuild and how did you get your confidence back!",Addiction
"I?m in what I?d consider to be the second honeymoon phase. My mind is clear and focused. My emotions are balancing out. My stress levels are the lowest they?ve been in years. Oddly enough, I had an intense using dream last night, which I guess is my mind?s way of saying ?not so fast? as the curtain of addiction continues to lift. It?s been 15 years of this shit, man. I?ve made countless attempts at sobriety, ranging from a couple hours to 14 months, and I?ve never wanted so badly to make substance use part of my past. I got clean this time because I was once again losing my grip on reality. I was hearing voices. I was broke. I was bottoming out. My days as a functioning addict were over.

Something I?ve been thinking about a lot lately is the idea of psychological addiction. I?ve never had much in the way of physical withdrawals. Opiates were never my cup of tea. My most recent cycle was daily marijuana use followed by two to three day Adderall binges. Wax on, wax off. But any addictive substance, even something as comparatively harmless of marijuana, produces physical changes in neurotransmission. The brain makes a maladaptive adjustment to substance use, etching it into daily life. I fell into this cycle originally because I completely misunderstood that concept. Addiction is not what I thought it was. It is so much worse. It takes over the mind. It robs you of the essential you, and you?re the last one to know it. There?s nothing I want more than than to pass this knowledge onto the younger generation, people like myself who have no idea that they?re getting themselves into something truly terrible, but at the same time I consider it to be a fool?s errand. Would I have listened when the drugs were a novel and truly exhilarating experience? I don?t think so.

The first time I consciously tried to get clean was over ten years ago. During this repeated cycle of recovery and relapse, I?ve lost so many friends. My best friend didn?t invite me to his wedding. There was never a falling out. People simply distanced themselves from me. I?m a liability. I?ve missed out on so much. Some days I feel nothing but regret. Other days I make peace by reminding myself I?m a more humble, more caring, and more understanding person because of the havoc addiction has inflicted on my life. I intimately understand failure. I know what it?s like to be objectively in the wrong. I?ve done some truly awful things that keep me up nights. My sober mind struggles to reconcile my actions in active addiction, and if I?m not careful that alone will make me relapse. There are so many triggers, so many trauma points, that sometimes I just want to scream. Or drive 100 mph into a brick wall, ending this struggle for my sanity altogether. Or get high. This week I feel great. A week ago I was at my wit?s end. That?s just how it goes.

Yesterday I visited my dad?s farm. Here in Ohio we?ve taken so much snow in the past couple days that I haven?t been able to work. I drive for UberEats, but I have a RWD vehicle. It handles well in the snow, but it?s prone to getting stuck when we get dumped on. Boredom is my worst enemy. I was so restless that I made the half hour journey to see my pops and the animals. Really I just wanted to play with the new puppy. We scurried around in the snow. The pup, me, and the adult dog of the same breed. My heart was filled with so much love and joy. I wasn?t concerned about my reup. I wasn?t in a rush to get home to my bong. I wasn?t frantic because I?d spent all my disposable income and then some ($400+/month on weed alone). I was truly in the moment, staying for dinner and chatting with my dad and his wife into the late night. I thought about how free I felt, how substances no longer run my life, and it?s enough to bring grown man to tears. Addiction is a nightmare. I don?t think you understand that until you break the cycle. Like what the fuck was I doing? That?s not life. This is.

My girlfriend and I sent messages back and forth when I got home. I slipped off to sleep with ease. Yet it was a night of using dreams. A day of recovery punctuated by the invisible hand trying to yank back into that lifestyle, the sickening fond memories of highs long gone, a reminder that I will live with this hideous affliction the rest of my life. Someone tell my 16 year old self that the drugs aren?t worth it. I?m 31, and I?m just now beginning to live.",Addiction
"I used to snort a lot of 3-FPM

I would be up all day and night for about 3 days and eventually take clonazolam and whisky to come down and crash out.

Then after a long sleep would need 3fpm again to get me going.

It was a loop that I didn't want to stop. The only reason it did stop is because I got sectioned.

Even then I saw it as a temporary setback and looked forward to doing it again.

My sinuses are still fucked :-(

Only as time passes I start to see that I was in a bad place and that I'm better off and a better person without it.",Addiction
"I'm struggling with the whole concept of ""recovery"" and the nature of addiction and mental illness. Im addicted to weed and relationships (codependency). I would be addicted to worse things if I let myself be exposed to them, but i know myself well enough to not put myself in those situations.

My question is, if you have this kind of ""addictive personality"" (i.e. mental illness, OCD in my case).....what does recovery even look like??? I find it impossible to conceptualize a future where I dont have an unhealthy underlying NEED for something. Whether its weed, a relationship, sugar, sex, attention, etc. If I gave up all of this to be healthier and focus on myself.....id probably develop one of my hobbies to an addictive, unhealthy degree, like my partially-recovered alcoholic dad has done with running/working out.

To be clear, I am currently medicated for OCD and it definitly helps, but I find it hard to believe any combination of therapy and drugs will ever solve my addictive tendencies. Is there hope? Is there a point in recovery where you wake up and realize ""Hey, I dont feel an unhealthy desire for anything/anyone. Guess I am 100% recovered""???",Addiction
"I am prescribed ten medications for the treatment of schizophrenia, bipolar, adhd, Willis Eckboms disease, and panic disorder. On top of this I take between ten and twenty grams of Kratom next to a few drinks on a nightly basis. At what point do I need to worry about my liver? Recent tests said my liver enzymes were fine, but I?m just wondering how long I can put 12 substances in my body without damage occurring. I?m on latuda, vyvanse, adderal, klonopin, benztropine, Ropinirole, gabapentin, levothyroxine, testosterone gel, propanalol, plus alcohol and Kratom. Without stressing the addiction aspect of all these medications, at what point do people begin to worry about their liver? Is this unsustainable or can I mostly go about my day to day life without worrying about it so long as I get regular blood testing?

"Almost 8 months sober, ruined from a panic attack. A few months ago I ordered 100 pills, because, well, I don't know. I shouldn't have even let them entire my possession. Push came to shove. I felt alone, suffocating, I couldn't breathe. I don't know why I resorted to digging the pills out the taking them. I should have had more self control, I don't understand. 50 or so pills. 30mg each. Before I was sober, I'd take 1000mg 3-4 times a week. But this was almost 500 more after 8 months of being sober. It hit hard.

My whole life has come down on me. I've officially lost whatever I had left. All because of a stupid relapse. But most importantly, I lost the love of my life, the very once who convinced me to stop. I'm scared.",Addiction
"So little background, I?m a 24 year old 5th year medical student in a different country from my home country and I haven?t been back home in 5 years so that should tell you about how my relationship is with my family, my parents are separated and you could tell they hate each other everytime they are together so I didn?t have the best childhood, my dad worked for an oil company and got alot of money but retired 8 years ago , the money is still there a bit and he?s a politician and he is a very frugal man so this would put things into perspective.

On October 2021 I was sent 5000$ which is equivalent to 2 million in my country currency for my feeding for a year and my house rent and bills, and my dad had a conference in Russia in February 2022 and thought I could use the money to secure him some accommodation too.

My history of gambling-I?ve been gambling since 2014 but it?s kinda been on and off but since 2021 due to lockdown I got too invested because I came across one gambling page on twitter which lead to 15 others, that?s when I started gambling with what little funds I had and managing the losses, then came October when I got the 5000$ , I started of slowly but dug my self into a big hole left with 1600$ on January, I decided to make a big gamble which I won which turn the 1600$ back to 4500$, any sensible person would have ran right? But no I kept gambling on soccer and basketball games, I couldn?t go a day without betting and having online classes means I was stuck that home spending 12 hours a day on stats and betting websites, Little by little I lost everything again, I tried another big bet but it didn?t work this time till I was left with nothing in my account,

Then I sold my iPhone to a friend and thought maybe if I?m more careful this time I won?t lose it but I also lost everything.

I feel like I wanted to fuck my life, I still don?t understand how all this happened, I lost everything in 5 months, now I have nothing, no money, no hope, I opened up to my roommates today about my situation and how I?m suicidal and they were understanding, agreed to cover me for this month

I don?t know where to start from because I?m a medical student and literally have classes every day and I don?t have a job,

I?m ready to face the consequences , i have to tell my parents, my relationship with my dad is strained already after I failed 2nd year of medical school in my country which cost a lot of money,so this would probably destroy it, he has already paid all my school fees so he probably would disown me, this would break my mom?s fragile heart, the woman loves me, one of the reason why I haven?t taken my life, my siblings would be disappointed and never look at me the same way, I ruined everything , I?ve been thinking of lying about losing the money to crypto which is less disgraceful than gambling because I?m African and gambling is frowned upon but I don?t want to lie, I want the truth out to be done with it

Yes, it?s not booze, and I haven?t spiraled or lost control of myself, but the fact that I?ve done this probably 10 times in 3 years does concern me.

That fact affected me a lot, I couldnt even sleep because of her :(, Everyday was so painfull and my head was full of suicide thoughts... Then, after tons of meditation i undertook a trip to the CDMX (I m from Mexico) just to clear my mind.

"In my experience, there are several different stages of addiction. The first being the complete belief that you are in control, having a good time and that its something that you want to do..Then comes the consequences, the occasional moment of clarity when you realise that you started the day with one intention, but ended up with something completely different. I.e. going out for one drink, waking up after a blackout 2 days later. For many, the consequences happen very quickly, for some, it takes years to develop into a problem. There is quite a lot of denial at this stage. NOBODY wants to be labelled 'addict' and further more, nobody like the idea that they have no power of their problem, that their willpower is basically zero and some instinctual pleasure seeking part of the brain is overriding any rational thought whatsoever.",Addiction

"IV meth addict here, I think people who gamble are gullible imbeciles and I don't understand why these people enjoy throwing hundreds and thousands of dollars away into a dumpster until they have no money at all and keep doing it over and over again.

Now I think drug addicts actually have good reasons. For one you're spending money on something that makes you high and feel good. I have gambled so I can say that there is no high or feel good with gambling. First time I did it put $2 in and walked out with $17 and I did have the high and good feeling because I had just got $15 for free pretty much. Second time I gambled I put in $14 and walked out with no payout, so $14 dollars broker then when I walked in. This led me to the logical conclusion that gambling does not give out free money and is stupid and for stupid gullible people.

I'm writing this post because my best friend of 12 years is a drug addict and gambling addict and he puts all this money into a dumpster and never has money for meth and kinda just expects me to constantly share with him and then when I run out of meth he of course doesn't have any for me which kinda is just a big ""fuck you"" right in my face.

Well he got paid and I hadn't yet and was broke and I asked how much he wanted to get and he said he only wanted to spend $100. Anyway we do that, split it up, and I give him $50 a few days later when I get paid. Now by that time the half we each had was gone and I was buying my usual quarter (around $400) to last me 2 weeks until next payday while my friend is already broke, no drugs, and gambled $800, walking away with nothing.

I tell him I am not smoking, sharing, fronting, nothing I'm fucking DONE. I'm gonna be selfish and I'm not going to feel bad about it. This seems so logical to me that any person with a fucking brain would stop gambling.

Now my good friend who I love very much is not a stupid gullible retard and he's actually very logical and has common sense. Except for when it comes to gambling.",Addiction

"I wrote on here about a month ago explaining how i?ve decided to start drinking again in moderation and how I firmly believe I can do despite what everybody has said. For context, i?m gonna paste that story but you skip over it or skim through it if you choose, there will be a clear indication as to where I resume this story.

(Previous reddit post about a month ago)

Male, 21 years old and come from a family with addiction issues. Started drinking in high school at parties and on weekends sometimes, never became a daily issue at the time.

It was when I started smoking weed around graduation that I realized I have addiction issues because I smoked pretty much everyday since then (3 years ago now) and have tried to quick pretty much everyday since and failed. Put the weed down cause of anxiety in Dec 2020 and picked up drinking. Boy oh boy was I in for a ride of a life time. What followed was Jail, misery, hopelessness, complete severance of relationships, regret, financial problems, etc. Keep in mind i?m not diagnosed depression or pretty much anything. before alcohol the first 20 years of my life were just fine and completely normal. I come from a VERY close family of 7 people, (2 married parents of 30 years and 4 siblings of whom i?m very close with) Which goes to show just how incredibly powerful this drug is and what it can do to even somebody who is well situated.

Was always self aware of everything I did and what I was doing to myself, just couldn?t stop. I went from drinking 2-3 Tall cans of beer daily in December 2020 to drinking 1 litre of vodka daily by the time May 2021 came. I pretty much dealt with what a typical alcoholic would have dealt with in the span of their 40 year battle per say, but crammed into the span of 5 months. It was ridiculous.

Went to rehab June 1st 2021, haven?t drank since. That is? until 5 days ago. I am fed up with these labels I give myself and believing that I cannot sip on alcohol for the rest of my life. I?m a person who is hyper-aware of addiction and how it works as I study it all the time and live it, so I have come to the conclusion that if I am in a good place in my life and feel stable, I can drink. And to put it simply, so far, so good?

I?m that person who is talking to my friend at the bar and while he?s telling me something, i?m just thinking about how he hasn?t sipped on his drink for the past 10 minutes.. wondering how? why? because I would have had my first 3 beers finished in 5 minutes to get the convos started. I am FASCINATED by people who leave the bar with their drinks half full, it doesn?t compute in my brain. Relatable eh?

Therefore, i?ve taken this knowledge and I am now applying it to my lifestyle. I drank one beer on January 10th, decided to leave a little bit in the glass as I walked out. Drank another beer January 12th, left a little bit in the glass again. Drank 2 beers tonight, stopped myself before going further.

I know I am putting myself at risk for what happened last time, all i?m trying to say is that I guess for a person that has brain abnormalities (addiction predisposition), it is taking A LOT of will power to do this, but so far I feel like I can do this. I?m not saying that all of a sudden I don?t have those addict tendencies like before, it took absolutely EVERYTHING inside of me to leave those last sips in and walk away, and to not go to the liquor store and get more, because fuck I really wanted to. So I guess for us ?addicts? if you want to drink again, obviously you can BUT it WILL come at a price. And that price for us ?alcoholics? is a very, very strong will power and mindset to control it. Some of us just may not be able to afford it.

Not intended to encourage drinking again, just my thoughts and experiences so far

(Story resumes here)

Everything I said in that story I firmly believed. All it took was about a week and what I found is that I quickly started to care less about my principals and routines and started picking up 1 more beer than I planned to per night and so on. It?s absolutely astonishing but I get it now. If you cannot drink in moderation, I genuinely now believe you never will. I have a disease, similar to somebody who deals with diabetes and requires insulin to survive. What I require is total sobriety and it pains me but at this point all I want is to be sober. I?ve spent countless nights begging god, the universe, whatever you believe in to heal me of this and let me sober and not buy a substance the next day but I end up doing it because, well, addiction. It?s a fucking pain in my ass. As it is for all of you beautiful people who are here to help and support.

I didn?t really think much about typing all this but i?m really drunk right now (Two 750ml bottles of vodka in to be exact) and I thought i?d just wing it because it?s getting me out of my head and all i?m looking for is ideas, responses, love, just something. I know I need to quit now and i?ve planned to set my first day tomorrow for the rest of my life. It?s just fucking god damn hard when you?re only 21 and have the illusion that you have the rest of your 20?s to party, have fun, get fucked up, have sex, pursue maximum dopamine release etc. I guess my main message here is for somebody who is an alcoholic, or as doctors put it, alcohol use disorder, we just can?t fucking drink. Just can?t. Unless you?re prepared to end up in Jail, loose your family, all relationships, become depressed and anxious etc. I love you alcohol, but I hate you.",Addiction
"On and off the last ten years. I?m now 30. If it?s not coke then it?s noz balloons or taking sleeping pills. I have a lot to be thankful for in life but I?m ruining everything. I believe I am an addict but then also I can really take or leave booze. I can have a really good night out like six times but then on the odd occasion I will want to get cocaine.

"I'm just 20 years old, but my gambling addiction started about 5 years ago with csgo gambling (you can look it up if you don't know about it)

1 day around 2019 I invested all of my money which was around 1000 euro into crypto because I am a strong believer in it. I always said to myself that I will never touch that money.

Well, for a long time I could keep my gambling addiction at a low cost. Every month I lost around 150 euro which was acceptable.

"I've only been sober (from alcohol) for three weeks, so I know I have a long way to go. I've been taking Topiramate which has really helped with the crippling cravings that have kept me relapsing before. Today though, I had a brain fart and wasn't sure if I remembered to take it this morning, so I decided to be cautious and not take it for fear of doubling up a dose. Obviously I didn't, because now I can't think of anything other than having a drink!

I'll be fine, I'm sure, but I'm wondering how much longer do I have to be sober until these kinds of cravings subside and I won't need the medication? I hate just sitting here wanting to do something...anything...but not being able to because my one thought is to go grab something alcoholic from the store.",Addiction

"My oldest brother, 40, and another older brother, 38, are both life long addicts, starting somewhere shortly after high school. My oldest got into heroin and opiates and has always lived with my mom, recently transitioning into meth on and off a few years ago. The other one was straight into uppers and never got the same leniency with my mom.

The 40 year old is entirely dependent on my mom financially, hasn't held down a job and hasn't even tried to be employed in 4 or 5 years. The 38 year old is in prison.

It's frustrating me because my mom can barely make rent, I find myself lending her money to just make ends meet and she refuses to acknowledge that it all stems from extra expenses for the 40yo as well as money on the 38 yo's books. She earns more than I do but has horrible money management and constantly lives paycheck to paycheck. The 40yo has always been welcome at her house and contributed little to nothing. What's worse, he is constantly venting to me about how toxic our mom is and how much she holds him back. He has a drug fueled religious fervor that has led him to write biblical passages on the wall and draw biblical scenes in sharpie when he is high all around their apartment. He has become angry and threatened violence if she even suggests that there are areas in which he could improve and constantly says the drugs aren't an issue. It's hard for me to argue because his life choices have never led to any of the consequences that would normally accompany a lifelong drug habit.

The 38 yo has never had the same leniency. He has lived on the streets and committed crimes to support his habit. Things the 40yo has never had to worry about.

Since I was about 8, all we have ever talked about as a family is one of these two brothers and I (29) am feeling more and more exhausted with it. My mom will invite me over to their appt (with sheets pinned over the windows and sharpie writing everywhere) and acts like if we all eat dinner and watch TV we can collectively pretend like everything is normal. Or if she comes over to my house or my other brother's (non-addict) house she thinks it's unfair that we aren't comfortable with the 40 yo there. It just feels delusional.

The 40 yo always says I'm the only person he can talk to and trust and I try to play a supportive role/ gently nudge him the right way. But at a certain point the pattern has to stop. The conversation always turn to how toxic Mom is in his eyes, which obviously makes me try to encourage him to get a job and move out, but he blows it off and acts like she's the one who needs to change and be more encouraging of his bizarre, constantly changing life goals. His stance stems from the idea that ""families need to support each other all the time, regardless of their problems"" but doesnt see the hipocrisy and the fact that he has never supported anyone, even himself.

We have tried interventions with all 3, including trying to convince my mom to stop enabling. But she can't bear to do it and is convinced that the 40yo isn't strong enough to survive any tough love. In her mind, he will starve or overdose the moment she stops enabling so she just keeps doing what she's doing. Her intentions, although misguided, are always about helping them. She would starve and live in the cold, and almost has, if it meant they were warm and fed.

I'm feeling trapped. Like I can't move forward with my own life. I want to get married and have kids soon but I'm scared that their lives will be tainted as well. I want to move out of town but my GF has a good career here and if I leave I think my mom will be swallowed up entirely by the 40yo. I don't know where to go from here.

I understand that addiction is a disease. I don't think anyone involved is a bad person. But my entire life to date has revolved around this one single issue and I'm not even the one who has any ability to change it.",Addiction
"I'm 18 now and it all started 4 months ago, since then I've gone out with 21 escorts. On average, 4 times a month.

I've always moved houses a lot and it makes it impossible for me to bond with anyone, bonds strong enough to be romantically engaged with someone I mean, I move basically every 1 year, and always to places far away from each other. I started working with my uncle and earning my salary, which is pretty high for someone my age, more than half go with prostitutes and the ones I hang out with are usually upscale girls, I don't like brothels and nightclubs so I always meet them outside, I can't stand a week without it.

"I'm 17 with addictions. I?ve recently recognized that I have an addictive personality. I immediately become hooked on any substance or activity that provides dopamine. I begin violently craving them to the point that it is the only thing I can think about and when I?ll do it next. Here?s a brief list of past and/or current addictions (from least to worst destructive). Feel free to skip around, summary at the end.

Food

It?s the only consistent addiction in my life. I?ve been doing it since I was about 11. I?m not obese or anything but I wish I had control over what goes into my body, and I wouldn?t mind losing some weight. I?ve eaten 4000 calories in a sitting to fill that void, usually followed by a day of strict restriction. I think that I regain control by over eating. People

I become absolutely obsessed with people I?m attracted to, which is normal, but I feel that I am on an extreme end of the spectrum. Within the first week of meeting the person they usually consume my every thought. Hence my strict no dating policy for myself.

shop lifting

This one was short lived. I did it for the first time in august and the last time in December. I think and hope it was the last time. Something about the rush of adrenaline during and after made it unbearable to resist. And getting away with it, well I was nothing less than a god in the moment. I realized it was a problem when I did it when I was with my mom, dad and sisters. I stole a small magnet. After leaving the store, while still high on the adrenaline, I showed off my token. My mother pulled me aside and rightfully so reprimanded me. I didn?t care in the moment but in hindsight it was devastating.

Wreckless driving

This is one that I try not to do because I know that it could end up with others injured or worse. The funny thing about addiction is that in the moment you do not care about anyone else, the ?high? is the only important thing. I?ve never been this type of person, I?ve always- well I still am, I am tender, kind and thoughtful. But my personality is pushed to the side when I have a chance to receive the high I need. This is devastating to me because I do not wish to harm anyone.

Self harm

Im not sure what this one is about. I?m not sure if I subconsciously think that I deserve the pain, or do I like the control, or maybe its the blood. I?m not sure. This one was very short lived as well but severe while it lasted. For about a month I would cut every day, sometimes multiple times a day. It was my release when I had overeaten, when I was overwhelmed or when I hated myself. I had a panic attack when I flew across the country because I knew that there would be no way for me to cut while I was there. That day was my first day of just over two months clean. I?ve since come home and have had minor urges but have been able to resist.

Alcohol

Ive only drank a few times for good reason. The hang over is no fun. I still do get the craving for it despite the pain it will cause the next day. It shoots me into a world besides my own where I am able to be worry free and that?s amazing, but unhealthy. It feels as though I am a toddler again, before I went though everything I went through. My rock bottom was probably drinking stolen vodka out of a coke bottle in my room alone at midnight. This was when I realized that I had spun out of control. I don?t think I have ever become addicted to alcohol but I definitely have the potential to become given my history.

Weed

This one is a combination of the effect from self harm and alcohol. it provides a release but I?m not truly addicted. Weed provides me with a release not an escape. It shushes my racing mind for just enough time for my body to catch up. I would not find my use of weed concerning if it were recreational, but its not, it?s a release and a coping mechanism. That makes it unhealthy.

Adderall

I would like to make it clear that this is by prescription. I have adhd and take it daily, sorta. The thing is is that I have become obsessed with the effect it provides. I?m able to function like a ?normal? person for the time being and that is something that I have always craved. The voice in my head that has never stopped has finally stopped, and god its like a breath of fresh air. The vibrating in my body slows and I can think. Today I had to skip my Adderall for medical reasons and all day I groaned to myself about how badly I needed it. I actually cried in class. Adderall has been my lord and savior but I?m addicted.

Ativan

This is also a prescription. It is from 2018 though. I suffered from crippling anxiety and this was prescribed to get my through the school day. The thing is is that I?m not supposed to be taking it anymore. But once an a while I take it for the euphoria. I?ve only done this a couple times but Ativan is nothing to play with. I?ve found myself craving it when nothing else is an option.

Summary: I?m not sure why I?m posting this. I know its really long, so if you didn?t read, I?m slightly addicted to a bunch of things. I think that each addiction developed as a coping mechanism from the previous, but I?m not sure. I know I need to get to the root of my pain and in turn, why I do this. I have a lot to figure out. I have a feeling that there are several mental illnesses that need a diagnosis. And I probably need some intense therapy to work though the horrendous childhood of mine. In the mean time it is terrifying growing up and watching myself throw everything away. I hope that this helped someone.",Addiction
"As much I want to be done and over with using, I?m not. No matter how many reasons I have to stop or how much others want me to, I don?t w a n t to stop yet. I like being high and drunk. I like not having to think or feel. I don?t want to use my DOC but I don?t want to stop using other stuff. I can?t tell anyone because I?d just be disappointing them and making everything harder for myself. Right now I?m just trying to find a new plug and get money. And honestly once I do, I will be content with it.",Addiction
"I used to be both a sex addict and a Marijuana addict, but marijuana was my main drug of choice and I was so addicted to it. I ended up smoking more than a gram a day of wax, to the point where I would start hallucinating. I was spending over $75 a day.

Being a person with disabilities this was my way of coping with things. I feel like a brand new person by getting rid of my drug of choice forever. It ruined me and I am better for leaving it.

I used to use sex as a coping mechanism too, slept with way too many people all the time and for me to go this long without it is also so incredible. I may not be fully straight edge as I have recently started just socially drinking but I will not keep anything in my life that I will abuse.

"My family has been going through a hell lot of financial problems. My dad lost his job due to the pandemic and my brothers situation was the cherry on top to the shitty situation we were already in. He was hospitalized a couple months ago and was eventually diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, and so most of our expenses go to his meds, healthy foods for him, etc.

Hes in his mid-thirties and still cant do his own paperwork or make his own lunch. My mom needs to stay up late portioning and making his meals for the day, which is upsetting asf. Hes always high, never takes care of himself, and pretty-much makes my mom baby him in a way.

There was a point in time where I thought he was suicidal because he wouldnt care at all about his health even after he got out of the hospital. All he does is sit in his room, smoke marijuana-- which hes literally NOT SUPPOSED TO DO-- and play videogames. No worries, and not a care in the world.

And yes he does have a job, but he spends most of his money on marijuana, im guessing. The rest goes to his meds.

I genuinely dont know what to do. Im still in highschool (15F), and the academic stress paired with my home situation just makes me want to give up at times. Every solution in my mind seems to come to a dead end that just always ends up with my brother not caring again.

I'm tired, my moms tired, and idk if my dads tired but theres no way he isnt. I want to help my brother but it seems as though he doesnt want to help himself.

So I tried a new approach where I don?t restrict it in the first place to try and remove the novelty. I?m having an immense amount of shame at how long I?m spending on it (7 hours a day.) But it is getting less. I don?t wanna go back to the cycle of deleting and redownlaoding. I want a long term solution. Has anyone gone through the same thing! Please I need ideas!!",Addiction
"A few months ago I decided to buy a dab pen and start smoking carts. I was sorta hooked on smoking but not carts. since I bought my first one, I keep buying every time one runs out and get high every day just alone in my house while the rest of the family is out at work/school. when the pen broke, I went immediately to the usb wire method. I have a job and am going to a community college trying to start my life out right. but fiending like I am now is causing terrible anxiety and depression,and having an ADHD mind it only makes the cravings so much more intense and difficult to deal with since I?ve never struggled with addiction to anything. I had a normal and enjoyable social life through high school, but as of now I just isolate a lot more and think I?m being a burden by sitting around getting high asf when I could be doing more",Addiction
"I started doing pain pills socially back in high school on the weekends drunk with friends. It was a huge plus when I would bring a girl home ;). Fast forward 10 years and I couldn't hold a job more than 2 weeks. I stole from family and friends to support my habit. (Was doing 2-3 opana 40s and a few perk 30s a day) it was really expensive. I burnt so many bridges and lost valued relationships. 2 years later and I now have my CDLs and been employed at the same job nearly 2 years. I still have plenty of money left on the next payday. I've paid back most of what I've ever stolen in cash value. But, it's hard knowing that family still keeps an eye on me at family gatherings. I still hear then whisper about me. I have my own home, 2 cars, 2 kids and been supporting my family on just my income but when I hear and see them do that it destroys me..

"My names Conor and I?m 19, 20 in a few weeks. I?ve had a friend who?s been my best friend for 7/8 years. He?s had a very tough life, his family is broken with an alcoholic father and mother who also can?t work. He?s been out of school since he was 16 ish because of mental health issues, issues I?ve tried my very best to help him with throughout the years. He?s had a tough time with addiction ranging from MDMA, Lyrica, cigarettes, weed and sleeping tablets which he took excessively. He?s managed to get by pills however now he uses alcohol daily and weed regularly. All of his friends have wanted nothing but the best for him, giving him clothes, buying him things and trying to motivate him to getting back to sports which he used to excel in, like really excel. And nobody ever asked for anything in return or expected it. He has stated his inability to apologize and very rarely thanks people. He?s also stated in the past how he wants to ?go off the map? and make new friends etc. basically insulting all of us for anything we have done for him. He can be violent, and has done criminal things such as robbing when he was on drugs. (Trying to impress a bad crowd). He shows no ambition, never lasted in a job and somehow none of this has ever been his fault, he also refuses to get a new job. No bank account, no passport, no nothing. No respect for anyone when he?s drinking and is loud and everyone avoids saying it to him because we know how he?ll react. Recently his brother asked him to be quiet because I?m assuming he was being loud and he started pushing him and punched him in the eye and pushed his mam. I just want to leave him because I think he?s a lost cause and I?ve down everything I can for him and don?t believe he?ll ever change. What should I do??",Addiction
"I'm (29M) a recovering addict from alcohol and Klonopin (6 years sober) and weed (7 years sober). I haven't been without a woman at some form of relationship, between casual or serious, since I was 22. I just got out of my last relationship and find myself immediately thinking about something new.

I'm realizing that I don't really care about anything. I'm starting a business, but that's really only been for the purpose of making more money, so I could attract higher quality women. I'm relatively handsome and tall and well-endowed, so I've been able to lean on that to attract and keep women even though I've been almost broke and surviving off the minimum wage I can to live and date women. I don't really know how to deal with this. People that I explain this to that even know I'm a recovering addict tell me it's just human nature. I also feel like if I had a really supportive woman by my side and a healthy relationship, I could then be happy and be able to pursue other goals. My sex drive is incredibly overwhelming. When I'm walking around and I see a sexy woman, I almost have to leave the store, for instance, and sometimes rush to leave and I'm usually panting and shouting super loud to myself when I get to my car something like ""Omfg, she was so hot!""

I recently beat a food addiction, like really beat it. Now, I don't even think about food and sometimes don't even finish my meals which is a huge change from before. I've never worked a program, but I read a lot self-help books, including about emotional intelligence. I know how to work on my addictions, but I just don't know how to approach this to determine what is problematic and what is not - what is addiction and what isn't.

I guess I'm trying to figure out what is human nature like people say and what is the addiction. Is it normal to base one's life around meeting the person of your dreams? Like I couldn't care less about accomplishing anything in life (I'm somewhat of a nihilist, believing that nothing really matters) except for having a super sexy woman by my side. Then, I'd probably work on other things if it was secure and only because I was satisfied.",Addiction
"I have been sober since April 2015. My drug of choice was oxycodone. It hasn?t crossed my mind for years. A couple weeks ago my so was injured pretty badly. They prescribed her 5mg oxy every 4 hours, I open her pill bottle and deliver her meds as she wasn?t able. Every time I was shaking internally reminiscing about the past all the nostalgia coursing through my body. Of course I wouldn?t take her meds as she is crying in the next room? that isn?t me anymore. 2 long weeks of this. I kept my sobriety. Tonight she has 3.5 pills left sitting in the closet. She isn?t taking them anymore. That stupid orange bottle is like the eye of Mordor calling me. I know addiction is life long. So tonight I?ll take a deep breathe and remember how good the last 7 years have been, how I haven?t had to lie to doctors, deal with gang members or steal from medicine cabinets. I?ll take a really deep breathe and remember how since I have stopped abusing, I got married, bought a house and kept really good jobs.
I?ll take another really deep breathe and wake my wife and explain that I?m struggling and we need to get rid of them.

i meant to give up meth last week. but i was an idiot and accepted some from a ""friend"" (yeah right, what fucking friend would introduce poison back in your life?). i relapsed on it yesterday and today. but as i was high as fuck, tweaking, reading this sub and everyone elses story it made me realize..... i truly do not need this shit. this shit is poison. so i went, got the baggy and dumped that sumbitch down the drain. it was about 2 grams worth so not a shit ton but a sizable amount i bought to last for a while. nope! im prepared to suck it up the next few days. thankfully i had a few days sober in between relapses but this time im thru with it. thru with everything related to drugs except weed because, well, everyones got to have a thing (please didnt come here to debate the merits of weed, its my choice, and i will keep it that way) anyways wanted to thank yall for persuading me to do what is fundamentally the correct and healthy decision. i truly do not need this shit in my life.

im honestly impressed that while in a state of intoxication off the crystal i had the good sense and willpower to realize what i was doing to myself and say ""fuck this nonsense"". honestly i've never had these thoughts on crystal, so i look at this relapse in a positive light. it is positive because even in the midst of a relapse spiralling downwards fast, something clicked, and even in the throws of it, i was able to not only realize what im doing to myself, but take action on it!",Addiction

"I (23f) have been an addict since I was 14. Started with benzos I was prescribed and codeine my mom had laying around. After 4 family and friend deaths, and a car accident that left me with brain damage and severe PTSD, I began abusing fentanyl and heroin. That was about two years ago now.

In August, I checked myself into rehab because my dealer robbed me and, honestly, I couldn't find another dealer and couldn't stand the withdrawals. I told them I got tired of living as an addict but it was a lie.

My family had NO idea I was an addict. Seriously. When my mom found out I was in rehab, she asked if it was adderall or something.

I was there for 8 weeks and they had me on suboxone. At the time of my discharge, I wanted to relapse right then. I didn't feel any better, despite doing everything they told me to do and trying my hardest. Meditation, praying (despite not believing in a higher power), nightly reviews, my fourth step. I did fucking prayer circles and everything. I really tried to find God.

So I essentially was white knuckling it for three months. Taking my suboxone, going to my appointments. I wasn't able to find a meeting that I liked, the only one within walking distance was all people 55+. They told me that I should find one with people my age. I started getting suicidal.

Last week, I got offered some fentanyl on facebook and now I'm using again. I feel guilty but I can't go through the pain of being sober anymore. Last night my mom hugged me and told me she's proud of me. I know I'm back right where I started and I should care more but mostly, I feel relief. Guilt, shame, but mostly relief.",Addiction

I have great difficulties just sitting down and focusing.

"I posted earlier today about how my fianc took too many of his klonopin and wanted to give a little update. His mom was able to come by today and help me.

He?s basically been resting when he can, not feeling well though, of course. He?s still kinda out of it and I really haven?t been able to speak to him but his mom and a nurse have been keeping me posted. I?m really hoping he will continue treatment. I?m very nervous and worried that he is going to be so angry with me since he kept telling me that taking him to the hospital would be the worst thing I could do. So we will see how that goes?

I?m just glad he?s in a safe, monitored environment right now where I know he will be taken care of.

"About two months ago I went down the gambling rabbit hole reaaaal fast. I always like playing football bets every now and then. But in october 2021 online gambling was legalized here in The Netherlands. To be clear I never visited a real casini before. But online casino's made it easy for me to gamble from the comfort of my mancave chair. I always prefered blackjack in free online games. So that's what I settled on. I started small (30 euro's). Had a pretty decent start and then thought: 'if I can turn 30 euro's into 90 euro's, then I can turn 100 into 300'. Well folks, it turns out I was fucking wrong. In total I wasted 1500 to 2000 euro's in 3 weeks or so. At a certain point it completely took over my mind. Especially when shit in personal life or work life got rough I got the craving to gamble. It was my way to deflect feeling shit. Turns out it was also my way to feel even shittier. My mind was constantly occupied with the number 21. I even gambled at work when the day was slow. My mood was completely bound to winning or losing. My god if I look back now I realise how awful it was. I also recall feeling completely hazed. At one point I thought: 'enough is enough' and found out I can self-exclude through our national gambling commission. This really killed it for me. Literally no more ways (except sketchy illegal shit) for me to gamble. Today I had a shit day at work and boy did I long for a pair of queens. But that's not the way to face a tough day. Work through it and don't avoid stuff. Really check if you can ban yourself from casino's / online casino's. It's a big step,but going cold turkey is the way.

"im Maria im 73 days sober and I think I'm gonna relapse. I really wanted to write out the reason why, so that it's on record somewhere in the depths of the internet. It all started when my friend introduced me to blow, and I have bpd- so if you're my favorite person at the time, we in it together. My friend is bipolar so he flew off the rails way before I did, got proper treatment and all, super proud of him. But I was just getting started. It kinda culminated when my friends boyfriend (a drug dealer) kinda integrated our friend group over summer 2021. I've got crazy FOMO, as the pandemic started I was 18, I never went clubbing or partying like crazy... I felt so behind, both socially and academically. I just wanted to catch up so bad. And my friends boyfriend (let's call him Enoch) would sell me snow to my heart's content. Soon he'd start giving me shit for free... Fast forward a few months, Enoch and his girl open up the relationship, and Enoch starts seeing Sevan (I know it's a guy's name but trust me Sev's a chick). Sevan and I meet when Enoch offers to smoke me out, at this point Im living on my own downtown, and it turns out me and sev go to the same school. We hit it off super well but Enoch makes it a point to mention to me and sev he won't give me drugs anymore. I'll find out later that Enoch will say anything to look good, but will rarely actually act on it. Me and sev start dating- like there's any way this will end well- considering Enoch was also dating her and Enoch was my best friend at the time. It was about to get hella messy. Mid October 2021 I relapse, Enoch gives me a shitton of snow for free. Sevan is bewildered, giving me ultimatums. At this point I was justifying my addiction in any way I could, so I got away with it somehow. Eventually Sevan broke up with Enoch and then me (she had the courtesy to meet Enoch over lunch but I got broken up w over text), I tell Enoch about it. It is a Monday night, I'm drunk off my ass. Enoch had just spent a few days in the psych ward, heads over to my place without telling me a thing. Of course we fucked. The motherfucker had feelings for me this whole time, and upon hearing me vulnerable and drunk, he jumps at the opportunity to ""comfort me"". Although Enoch and his girlfriend were open, they had agreed I was off limits, and that this was officially cheating. Enoch agrees to tell his girlfriend the truth as I head to class. I'm panicking, I puke on my way to class, I leave class early cuz I'm so out of it and Enoch WAS STILL IN MY APPARTMENT. I tell him I need some space- and he says he's gonna go for a drive. And sure he does: he goes missing for three days. This is when I find out about the psych ward, about his mom starting chemo (yes he stole his mom's car as she was starting chemo, I can't make this shit up). Everyone thought he was dead. Enoch had a history with suicidal ideation. His mom texts me, and I find out he's missing, and I think ""oh my god he's dead because of me, I'll have to go to a funeral and pretend I don't know why he killed himself"". And I realised what I had to do... I tell his girlfriend the truth. The cops found him a few days later, and all he had to say was ""I didn't start it"" to his gf to give her all the info she needed. Obviously I lost two of my closest friends. They're still together though. Oh and after I got clean, I managed to stay friends with Sevan, but I kept getting the ick- knowing she was still friends w Enoch. Now it was my turn to give her the ultimatum, him or me. She chose him. Now I've survived the worst of it. Now after all this how can I even consider relapsing?? Well, I dropped out after all that, cuz my head wasn't working so well, and I had to move back into my parents house. It's two years later since March 2020 but I'm reliving the same day over and over again, and I've got but more of this tartarian expanse waiting for me for the next year. Perhaps if I relapse I'll prove to myself that the damage Enoch did was irreparable. Unforgivable. As if by relapsing, I'll be taking my revenge on those who hurt me. I have things going for me but, Im so scared of living.",Addiction
"I feel dead inside because of my moms drug addiction.

"Context: I'm 26 years old. On paper I'm successful and run a really cool company that presumably would make me good money and live a good life.

Since 18 I've been a raging gambling addict. I was cursed by winning a ton of money early, like six figures over a sustained period of time, and thinking I was a professional. I wanted my life to be either professional sports betting or analytics based on my sports betting prowess. I chose my major at a top university based off of it and even made presentations to large classes at request of professors in college about how good I was at gambling. By the end of college not only had I lost hundreds of thousands of dollars and was destitute broke, but I was also a bookie who was betting against his own book and was under threat by people with heavy mob ties for owing tens of thousands of dollars. I played hardball with them, risked the wellbeing of people I cared by calling bluffs on threats and eventually they left me alone because the nature of the business I started in 2017 made it too risky for them to go after me. In those years, I lost hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars gambling. I was an early investor in cryptocurrency, and bet with crypto almost exclusively. Not that this matters, but those losses in present value are easily $10 million of Bitcoin, maybe more.

I got to almost three years of clean time from 2018-2021 before I relapsed after the GameStop craze here on reddit sucked me in. Thought I'd just make a quick couple day trade, ride the wave and get out. My bank account was up to $70,000 of hard-earned money, by far the best it had ever been, it had been so long since I had gambled that I was sure it was a thing of the past, and I ""had a few grand to play around with"". One trade of GameStop and before I knew it I had lost 50 or 60 grand in a month (I realized my GME losses pretty quick, wasn't joining that cult, lost 20-30 grand more sports betting) and was back to square one.

Depression over this pathetic relapse led me to start smoking weed and taking drugs again. I have a serious allergy to weed called Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome where weed can literally kill you. After a three month bender of weed and many other drugs, toiling in the depression of losing all my money, I checked myself into rehab and got sober July 10th 2021.

Fast forward to this past weekend. I've had a few gambling lapses the past month, like losing a few hundred here and there. Basically been consciously throwing out long shots every now and then to try and get lucky and make a few grand to pad my bank account. I'm living with my parents, after living in a beautiful NYC apartment from 2019-2021. I've been here since August. I'm finally getting into a situation where I've been looking at some (albeit shitty) apartments in Brooklyn. I think I got triggered by this and on Friday I deposited $500 into a bitcoin spots book.

I turned $500 into $5000 in about 15 bets over a 2 day period. I withdrew a grand every time I won, telling myself this was the gambling god's last gift to me, and that I'd keep going heavy until the hot streak ended. Once I lost a bet, I promised myself, I'd have this newfound money that I'd withdrawn into my bank account, and call it a career.

I forgot that you never stop until you're not up anymore.

24 hours ago I was up $5,700. For the situation I've been in the past year, that is life-changing money. I had withdrawn $3,500 of that into my bank account. I put $2,200 on the Australian Open Championship last night, and lost in brutal fashion in a six hour match that kept me up until 9 AM Eastern Time. I managed to hold my word for about 20 minutes. Next thing I knew I put $500 back into the site for one last hoorah. Next thing I know it's another grand because that bet lost. Next thing I know it's another $1,500. And now here we are, 24 hours later, and my bank account is almost zero.

I am so ashamed of myself because I feel like I have already learned enough of these lessons to be wise beyond my years. And it makes me almost mourn for myself like I have something broken in my brain that will never be fixed. I'm doing ok in my sobriety from drugs (living in a small house with my parents who know about my issues helps), but I am just so incredibly depressed and angry at myself. I just bought myself months more of the shame of living with my parents, not being able to get out into a place of my own.

Though many look at me as successful and even inspirational because I hide my flaws from all but my close friends and family, and am somewhat of a public figure, I look at myself right now and see the biggest fucking loser I know.",Addiction

"Hopefully someone who went through something similar can provide some perspective. A lot of times, you'll see people talking about ""I just want to experience the joy and happiness I had before I started using"" or ""go back to before I relapsed, when I was so happy and joyful.""

I do not relate to that at all. For me, really the only true, absolutely amazing happiness I have ever experienced was through substances. Everything else, family memories, times with friends, doesn't even come close to comparing. I've been ""in recovery"" with a relapse here and there for 2 years. Currently living in a halfway house and moving out in a few months to my parents so I can save money for an apartment. After that, my plan is to just work, come home and smoke weed, and rinse and repeat.

The things I enjoy besides doing drugs are video games, pagan spirituality, and playing/writing heavy metal music, all things that the Christian halfway house I'm in frowns upon, as well as my parents. This makes it very awkward for me to go and seek out people who share the same interests, as the House manager and my parents will want to know what I'm up to and dissuade me from it. So, I try to stay in my room as much as possible and not interact with anyone. If I can get by without saying one word to another person IRL in a day, I consider it a victory. I have no idea whether I'm an introvert or extrovert, but I genuinely cannot stand being around people in recovery at all anymore, repeating the same shit over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again-- the quotes from the rooms, pithy non-denominational Christian sayings, talking about how blessed they are to be given the opportunity to be in a halfway house.

I used to have very high aspirations, but I've come to realize they're all nonsense. It took everything in my power to meditate, read spiritual literature, and engage in intellectually stimulating conversation everyday for 3 months, and it still didn't even come close to providing the relief and happiness that a bowl of weed does. I've tried therapy; planning on dipping my toes back in, but my anxiety and need for the therapist to like me prevent me from unloading my true anger, misanthropy, and frustration, so I end up just self-analyzing in the room with them for an hour and getting a worksheet that I rarely complete. Honestly, I just want someone to be able to look me in the eye after hearing every single one of my disgusting, hateful thoughts and seeing the worst of me and say, ""I love you and like being around you."" Even more than that, I desperately want to be able to believe them.

This post has turned into more of a rambling ventpost, so my apologies for that. Hopefully someone sees it and can relate and give me some guidance.

"So to start this off like many others here I have an extremely addictive personality. I literally can get mentally/physically addicted to any substance that gets me out of my own head.

I was begging him everyday to stay sober, I also found red dots in both arms at the same spots so I was pretty sure he was injected himself again (he denied it like 100 times) until I told him that I wanted to go back to my country because the situation was making me very unstable and depressed.

"Me and my girlfriend of 5 years broke up a few months ago because things were getting super unhealthy with both of us using drugs and such. When we broke up I decided to get clean and have been doing a lot better, but she called me about 3 weeks ago and told me she overdosed. Her and her friend decided to get fentanyl one night and as soon as she did it she nodded out and stopped breathing. Her friend gave her narcan and an ambulance was called. Luckily she?s okay.

When she called me she really needed somebody to be there for her and to help her through detoxing and everything, so I?ve been there for her everyday since. But last week I found the same mbox 30s that made her overdose hidden under the sink, along with a rolled up piece of paper to snort it with. Every time she goes to the bathroom I hear her crushing it. She?s always extremely nauseous and itchy, and she?s nodding out in bed.

I?m worried fucking sick. I asked her the other day if she was hiding drugs in the bathroom and she got extremely defensive and mad. I?m not here to judge her, and I?m definitely not judging her either way because I understand what that shits like, I?m just so concerned about her health and safety to the point of feeling like I need to check her breathing and heart rate every few min when she?s sleeping.

"I know it's a bit long, but I want to, as briefly as I can, share my story and experiences with you all, as well as being glad I got through these things, so that I can now celebrate and be proud of my small achievements.

Just for a quick back story... I had a pretty rubbish upbringing, divorced parents, a toxic relationship with my father and step mother, bullied at school, no friends, diagnosed with various mental illnesses at 12 years old and in and out of mental health services/social services till I was 18...

In 2014, just after my 18th birthday, I entered a 4 year long relationship with a man who physically, sexually and emotionally abused me for the whole time, we had a child together, who I lost custody of and haven't seen since they were 2 years old.

I left the relationship at 2018 when I was just turning 23, I moved in with my mum, and even though we had quite a toxic relationship while I was growing up, I think not seeing me or speaking to me for four years during my abusive relationship, worrying about how I was being treated and not knowing whether I would end up dead, completely changed her and changed how she was towards me and it also changed how I was towards her, as me and my mum have always mirrored eachother and brought out the best and worst of eachother and during those four years, we both changed and grew a lot as people ...

But a year or so down the line, mine and my mum's relationship broke down which resulted in me becoming homeless. Not only was I suffering badly with my mental health, (PTSD, DID/personality disorder, psycosis and depression) but I had also just quit my job and had no money, I wasn't speaking to my dad so couldn't stay with him and I became homeless during the beginning of the pandemic, so not only was I at risk of catching covid, but I couldn't go and stay with my Nan, who was probably the one person that would have had me live with her rather than being on the streets.

I ended up, thankfully, being put into temporary accommodation and also had the pleasure of meeting my fianc, who I have been with for nearly two years now, but on the downside, my addiction got a lot worse and a lot heavier and my mental health was at its very worst, especially as I had no therapy or counselling for the previous domestic abuse and I was still dealing with the pain and trauma of all of this alone.

Then December 2020, at 2am, I was physically assaulted in my local high street, and never recovered mentally from this

My addiction had improved so much before this had happened, I was on Espranor (which is like subutex) and had cut down my use massively, but after this incident, I fell straight back down that dark hole of allowing myself to be cuddled and cared for by drugs and just numbing the thoughts and the pain that came to me everyday.

Since then, I haven't left the house really... Out of the 365 days in the year, I had probably spent about 50 of those, properly outside of the house and that's it, I have to go to my pharmacy everyday and go to mental health appointments every two weeks, but that's as much as I can cope with..

I spent most days in bed, watching TV or flicking through social media because I cannot physically get out of bed, I just have a complete block, my brain won't allow me to do anything else, I'll stand up and prep myself, ""right, screw this, I'm going for a walk"" and instantly my body will respond with, ""ooft, I'm feeling absolutely exhausted, I can barely keep my eyes open, my legs hurt, I need to lay down and sleep"".

I completely let myself go.

I will go days without washing or brushing my teeth, I won't cook for myself or eat proper meals, instead I'll spend my day eating a few packets of crisps/chips, a microwave hotdog, crackers with butter/soft cheese, yoghurts, chocolate, brownies etc, I won't tidy up my flat or wash the dishes, I barely do any laundry (which I don't really need to do anyway because I'll either wear the same tracksuit bottoms and jumper all week or just wear my PJs), I'll ignore all my phone calls, ignore my partner, not show any affection and be completely selfish.

Occasionally, I'll have 2 or 3 days where I'm full of energy and motivation and self love, I'll have a shower and a shave, wash my hair, brush my teeth, pamper myself by wearing a face mask, doing my nails, I'll put on nice clothes, go to the pharmacy, do some shopping, take a walk, cook some nice food, be affectionate and attentive to my partner, give my flat a spring clean, do all my laundry, and then bam! After those couple of days, I'm back to being stuck in bed.

I ended up getting put onto regular medication, anti psycotics, anti depressants and sleeping pills, which allowed me to get control of my addiction again, as I no longer needed to numb my feelings and emotions, as the medication was balancing everything, as my drug use has always mostly been an attempt to self medicate, I no longer needed to give myself my own treatment, as I was now getting stuff that was doing a good enough job, but then later on in the year, the doctor decided to take me off of everything, saying my mental health was drug induced and completely disregarding the multiple diagnosis' that I have, the 4 years of domestic abuse that I'd been through, disregarding the fact that I've had multiple mental issues since I was pretty much born and have had these issues long before I started doing drugs and disregarding that I was using drugs to self medicate BECAUSE I wasn't getting any treatment for my mental health in the first place. So because of the Doctors wonderful and helpful choice, again, I have gone back to allowing illicit drugs to numb my pain and help me ignore my problems rather than actually facing and/or dealing with anything.

So...At the beginning of this year, I decided that if I'm not going to go out, I need to make being inside, fun, productive, positive and happy, so I figured I would firstly:

1.Practice self love and self care by keeping up with my hygiene more often, I wouldn't push myself and force myself to shower everyday, for example, but perhaps have a shower every other day, or every couple of days. 2.I would then take pride in my appearance and also dye my hair and keep up with maintaining the colour, as usually I will dye my hair and then leave it to fade and let the roots come through and not touch it again for another six months, but now I've decided to always keep my hair looking pretty and presentable, touching up my roots and colour constantly or changing the colour regularly rather than letting it fade. 3.On some days I will dress myself in nice clothes, even if I am only just going to the pharmacy or just going food shopping, I will put on a proper outfit rather than wearing sweats all week 4.I also plan to pay more attention to my partner and if I'm feeling withdrawn and don't want to be affectionate because I'm feeling bad, I will tell him this rather than just ignoring him and I will also work on communicating better and be more open about how I'm feeling 5.But most importantly, I decided to take up 3 hobbies which I plan to dedicate myself to, get good at and hopefully, turn my hobby into a business.

I've started knitting, crochet, and model making/sculpting with clay. I've knitted and used clay before, I have a basic knowledge of each, but stopped doing these things after s few years and decided I'm going to give them a go again and not give up this time, but I am learning how to crochet for the first time ever.

I struggle to dedicate myself to hobbies because I have a low attention span and get bored of things quickly and also give up as soon as the product or result of what I do isn't ""good enough"", I have a perfectionist mindset and expect to be a professional at something, the first time I try it and give up if it's not at a perfect standard first time, but I can say, with pride, that I have stuck to these things and motivating myself to practice and practice and keep getting good. I have a goal in my mind and this time I'm determined to reach it.

Being stuck in the flat for the last two years has made me feel like a failure and a waste of space, I'm not contributing anything to the world or society, I'm not socialising with anyone and I started to feel like my existence was pointless as I'm not doing any good for anyone and just being selfish and living in my own world, isolating myself from everyone. Because of this, it sparked my idea to start documenting my journey with my mental health and addiction and allow people to follow me on my path.

Spending a lot of time alone has also made me think about how everything online is so edited and how everything is portrayed in a way that people's lives are perfect and happy and people's appearances are also portrayed the same, so when people like me go online, we feel depressed, envious, insecure, because our lives are often sad and depressing, we go through a lot of trauma, most of the time we don't look our best or don't dress our best and we feel like failures because our lives aren't the same as the ones we see online, this thought has made me want to show people the honest reality of my life. I had the intention to show people that life isn't always perfect and that we can always look sexy and beautiful, that it's completely normal to stay in bed all week and not shower for a couple of days. (I know I discussed the potential of doing something like this with some of you, but I am fully embracing and dedicating myself to the idea now, thanks to all of the positive responses I got from everyone, so thanks to you all for that)

Doing this, like my hobbies, is another way for me to escape and live a fulfilling life and doing this will make me feel like I have purpose again, and that I'm not just a waste of life and energy because it will give me the opportunity to positively affect people's lives and potentially help, support and guide people as well as helping others to feel like they're not alone and that there are people in the world that understand how they feel and experience the same things as them.

As well as all of these positive ideas that I have thought of, which will hopefully improve my life and my mental health, I have finally been seen by a psychologist and starting trauma therapy in the next month... This will be the first time since experiencing domestic abuse that I will be addressing the trauma and pain caused by that situation, which will hopefully help me to move on and potentially, will be the key to getting me out of my bed permenantly and help lead me back out into the world again and give me the tools to care for and look after myself.

"Trying to quit vaping. i don?t know anyone who?s recovered from a vaping addiction, and even if I did, I?d be too ashamed to tell anyone I started vaping in the first place, let alone become addicted to it.

For those of you that have overcome a vaping addiction, how was the recovery process?

From what I understand, getting over a vaping addiction is easier than a smoking addiction, I?ve heard the craving to puff is significantly less after the first week, if youll still feel the craving at all?

I?m worried that even after the initial cravings stop, I?ll still want to vape because since I?ve started vaping regularly throughout the day, it no longer has the same ?zonked? affect as when I first started. After the initial cravings subside, I?m worrried I?ll want to puff again anyway to see if that ?zonked? feeling will come back after I?ve given my body time to get the nicotine out of my system. What if I?m just trapped in this cycle of ?addicted, get clean, puff again to feel zonked, get addicted again? cycle for the rest of my life?

A part of me just wonders if it?s just the addiction talking though, maybe I won?t even care to be zonked after I get clean? Do any of you have any pointers, tips, or advice from your own experience?",Addiction

"Any advice on rehab services for those particularly resistant to anything ""new age"" or things that might seem too ""liberal""?
The title of my question is inherently problematic, probably, but it's the truth I'm dealing with.

My dad, 62, is a very proud, admit-no-feelings, self-proclaimed ""traditional"" man. Hes never dealt with any problems in life - hes always just gone with the approach of ""let's not turn XYZ into a big deal,"" hates all things California, loves Fox News, thinks everyones out to cancel christianity....

I realize I've probably also just made him sound beyond saving, but believe it or not when you peel him away from Fox News, he really can actually be a kind hearted, decent individual. He can in some ways admit hes not perfect, just not at the level that requires him to drastically change his status quo in life. He has an immense amount of pride and cant stand not looking like he has everything together when it comes to the big stuff in life. He can be very generous and I do believe he loves his children, not just from a self-serving angle. Hes flawed but hes not evil.

Anyway.... hes drastically thrown himself into alcoholism since his father passed 3 years ago. He didn't drink a drop the entire time I was growing up, but I think now that hes relatively done raising his children, and the undealt with grief of his own dad passing.... hes gone down a very dark hole. Hes passing out drunk IN PUBLIC, getting kicked out of bars.... it's so bad. Hes going to kill himself soon if he keeps going down this road.

I realize rehab only works if people are willing to put in the work and want to change and that it's going to be a tough sell to get him to accept help. But I'm considering arranging an intervention and I'd love some advice on rehab suggestions perhaps specifically geared towards those who find ""modern mental health"" too ""woowoo."" Again, I hear this sounding dumb, but it's where I'm at.

He is catholic. Maybe there is a catholic rehab that isnt all shame based brainwashing? Ugh. I'm just wondering if anyone has found a rehab that maybe is a little less intimidating for conservative folks, without it being a twisted christian hellscape.",Addiction

Focusing on others needs and their wants, and just going over and above for others so that i could feel cared for and loved (although i appreciate that now). I had zero boundaries and would make so much effort for others. I also would get annoyed that others didnt reciprocate but i didnt share that for fear of rejection.

"I?m not sure where I could post this but? I?ve been with my boyfriend for about a year and I never saw a problem with my weed consumption. I was about a year clean when we first met but after a couple months I become very depressed. I had a lot going on at home and at school. I was just exhausted and drained all the time. I decided to start smoking again just to get high. The first couple of times I started using it again was just for fun. But then it got to the point where I started using it when i was having a bad day or just needed to get rid of some stress. I never saw it as a problem because I didn?t do this on a daily basis and used it as a way to get ?help?. I would only do it every once in a while. For example, i would smoke every weekend or every other week. It did help me a lot. It made me feel calm and euphoric. And I loved that feeling. Every time I would get high I would call my boyfriend and we would just talk and fall asleep together and I liked that. Unfortunately, one of the times I smoked I had a really bad trip which caused me to hyperventilate for a long time(i dont know how long I don?t remember much from this night). But I do remember being scared that I was gonna die (even tho you can?t OD on weed). When this happened I was otp with my boyfriend. He was scared and worried about me. Basically, I left him traumatized. I didn?t know this because he didn?t really tell me. So I kept smoking despite of that. My boyfriend had opened up about how he felt about me smoking and expressed to me that he didn?t like it and that I should probably stop. I told him I would stop so I did. I was clean for maybe 3 months or so. But round October 2021 I got in a big argument with my dad and he ended up hitting me and kicking me out. And within the same week of this happening, I had found out that my boyfriend had been lying and hiding things from me. Basically, he made a secret TikTok account just so he can look at girls, he had many porn accounts, and was basically addicted to porn. This made me upset because during our whole relationship he told me he didn?t watch porn and that he would never follow girls or look at them like that because he ?respected? me. He also knew how I felt about this. I relapsed because of these two things. But I didn?t tell him. He promised to me that he would be better and stop lying and hiding things from me. So I promised him I would stop smoking. I was fine until mid December when I found out that he was still doing the same behavior. He also told me that he masturbated to girls from his school, his own cousin, possibly gore(???), and much more disturbing things. This really fucked with me. I would always think about the things he did to me and said to me. He lied to me twice about it, both times promising he would be better. I couldn?t get the girls out of my head. I would constantly compare myself to them and when he would compliment me I didn?t believe him because clearly I wasn?t his type. This would be all I think about 24/7. I would lose my appetite, not eat, and feel sick about this. I was disappointed and infuriated about this. So I said fuck it. I need to smoke. So I relapsed. I relapsed the beginning of this month and wow. I feel like sometimes weed/drugs aren?t as bad as people make it seem. I felt calm, my mind was blank, I felt peace. For the first time in months. I felt amazing. It really helped me. It made me forget about everything he did. I didn?t tell him about this time either. I felt amazing. When I woke up the next day I really felt like a whole new person. I woke up feeling content with who I was and I felt happy with myself. I was able to forget about the girls and all which really helped. Unfortunately, just a couple days ago I had confessed to him and told him about the day I relapsed and he was very upset with me. He thinks I have a problem or an addiction because every time I would get upset the first thing that would come to mind is ?I need to smoke? or ?I wish I was high?. He also thought this was a problem because of the fact that I kept doing it and lying to him and manipulating him (I didn?t realize I did). At first I refused to believe this because of the fact that I didn?t do it everyday. And I did it because I needed help and I felt like I had no one. Him and I had an argument yesterday because of this. I told him the it was his fault I relapsed. He didn?t let me explain to him on how I had been feeling and the main reason I relapsed. He lied to me and basically cheated on me. He?s in active recovery about this. But he gave me an ultimatum. Him or drugs. I honestly didn?t know which one I wanted to choose. So he said if I wasn?t willing to try and get better he would leave me. So my question is do I have a problem? If so how can I do better. I don?t have access to a therapist because of money problems but I?m willing to try my best with what I got. I just don?t wanna break up with him even tho after what he did I did see a lot of growth in him when he actually started to be better. Anyway though, what can I do.

"Weed addiction is real.
From around grade 9 to grade 11 in high school I was very addicted to marijuana.

Everyday when I would come home from school I would smoke in order to forgot the shitty life I was living. I wasn?t smoking in groups of people like normal high school potheads, but instead I would do it by my self for the main purpose of forgetting about my horrible social life. The main reason I would do this is is because of my horrible anxiety I had while in school. I just got so paranoid being around other people in certain situations and instead of thinking about how I could fix myself I would instead get high. It got so rough that instead I was only happy when high off of marijuana. When high I just felt a sense of enjoyment, a feeling that I would not get while sober.

Something that I want kids in that may see this post is to live high school like nobody is watching you or judging you, don?t get so wound up anxiety that you have no social life because of it. Also I suggest to not smoke marijuana by yourself because it can easily and quickly become a coping method for depression.",Addiction
"Addicted to someone who no longer loves me.
First off, I apologize if this isn't the appropriate sub for this. I'm absolutely addicted to a person who has little to no feelings for me and I don't know how to put an end to it. When I say addicted, I mean that I check their activity status dozens of times a day to see what they are playing, or listening to, or if they've followed anyone new, etc. I reread our old sappy conversations trying to feel happy but it's bittersweet. I can't do hardly anything without it reminding me of them in some way or another, whether it's a good memory or a bad one.

We used to be together - we've known each other for about 3 years, been together for ~2. We were both overly attached and possessive of the other and decided it would be better to break up, but remain a bit more than friends (cuddling and the like). We stopped being together over 6 months ago. Things were going very well but in the last two months they have gotten distant. We stopped seeing each other for the past two months because they come from a big household of unvaccinated individuals and I didn't want to risk carrying covid to my dad, who I live with.

We used to tell each other ""I love you"" often and that doesn't happen anymore. They say they have been majorly depressed and want to be isolated from everyone, so I've been trying my best to not message them or otherwise bug them. But I can't shake this fear that they don't want me anymore, when I ask if they want what we have they just say ""I don't know"".

I don't know how to stop myself from obsessing over this person. I think what makes it all the more painful is that they told me it was really cute that I cared so much that I would check their profile so often and was so needy for them. I highly doubt they still feel that way. I can't stand the thought of them falling for someone else. On top of it all, my life has gone to shit recently and I need their support now more than ever.

Now he?s always at my place since he?s ?looking for a place?, I was okay with it since I enjoyed his company. Then week 3-4. He asked me for $120 and a long explanation on why. I figured he has taken me out a bunch already (weeks 1-2) so I sent it. He said he?ll return the money tomorrow before work.

He never did.

I end up going on vacation for a week. We text a bit but before I left he wrote multiple messages about how amazing I am (we don?t really know each other that well, so I was kinda like whatever, but responded flirty.) After I get back.

I have no clue about drugs.)

Somehow I had just enough self-awareness to look at how much further I had to fall and recognize that this is the time to stop.

I grew up LDS (Mormon), and I pushed away really hard. Organized religion is not for me, nor was any higher power for most of my life. I've wanted to stop for a long time, I've known that I had a problem. I tried NA and I had these roadblocks that I could identify, but couldn't get past. I got a sponsor, I really tried, but I couldn't stay clean for more than a week. Surrender was so difficult for me; I couldn't figure out how to accept there was a benevolent higher power. I gave up, I decided I could just be a better addict.

It got worse, naturally. I overdosed, should've died. I got lucky. My mom had a hunch for some reason, cops came over to my apartment for a welfare check. I was still just barely coherent enough to let them in. I had almost an ounce of meth in separate bags, fentanyl, a scale, benzos, a bunch of thc carts. I wasn't selling, but it sure as hell looked like it. They didn't charge me because I was cooperative, took me to the ER. Ended up in the BHU, they assumed it was an attempted suicide.

I don't think I'll ever forget the moment it finally all clicked for me. I was getting ready to start trying to manipulate the therapist there so I could get out ASAP and go back to what I was doing. But for some reason I decided to take a step back and just look at my life. I had been miserable for so long. This is one of 4 overdoses, 3 of which happened in the last year. I'm gonna fucking die. Do I really want to die? That's where I'm headed, I can only get lucky so many times. I had a scholarship to school, a girlfriend of 5 years, a nice apartment, a pretty good job. Lost it all. And I just finally surrendered.

I still don't believe in God, but I can now flip the switch in my brain that denies the existence of a higher power. NA just started working for me. I spent the next week cleaning out my apartment, packing a single suitcase with clothes and I moved to another state. I'm going into a rehab facility in 10 days. I finally figured it out, and I'm so grateful to everyone that got me here. I wouldn't change a single fucking thing that happened. I get to draw on those experiences for the rest of my life. My parents, my girlfriend that enabled me, my using friends, hell my dealers; Thanks for the ride. It's time for a personality change.",Addiction
"Hey so this will be my first post on here and itll be about a situation that I shouldnt be in but I am in because I was forced into it. So a couple weeks ago i got a snap for a girl I'll call Olivia. Olivia tells me that shes a horrible friend for doing it but shes released on hydros but makes sure I know she wont do it again, so I'm like ok that's not like terrible I wont tell anyone about it. A week later she tells me shes been doing them for a week straight. This freaks me out of course and makes me really nervous and anxious so after 30 minutes I finally convinced her to tell her boyfriend well call him mark. But she didn't tell mark the truth she only told him that she was thinking about doing them. This makes mark very upset that she lied to him but not upset enough to not make the 2 hour drive to see her this weekend. Btw mark is one of my roomates. So mark breaks down after a night of us drinking and doesnt know what to do so my drunk ass gives him am amazing talk about it and what he should say and do coming forward. While hes drunk he tells me he's going to arrange a meeting with her dad while he is back so I'm like bam problem solved her parents will know about it. Next day I'm like did you tell her dad? Mark is like nah her dad is going to be in boone 2 hours away and I don't want to tell him over the phone. So I'm like drive to Boone and tell him cause the sooner the better. And hes like nah. So my other roomate john is back in Charlotte right now and I'm like you want john to tell her dad he says no, im like ill.be back in fort mill in a week I'll tell him he says no. While all this is going on she is making posts about doing hydros and shit and its freaking me the fuck out like she is going to die. So I told him tonight that I'm going to tell her parents in two weeks if he doesnt tell them and then freaks out on me calls me an asshole says fuck you and is just livid at the thought of me telling her parents without his permission but I know for a fact he will not tell her parents anything about the drugs and alcohol abuse as well because he is too focused on not thinking about it to have a good plan on how to deal with her drug problem. So I think if nothing happens and it's only us that know she is either going to die or commit suicide and I couldnt live with myself knowing that it was preventable. So people of reddit should i finally get it over with and tell her parents or just remain neutral about to whole thing and not do anything at all.",Addiction

"Relapse caused heavy psychosis
A little bit of background on me: I was addicted to stimulants since I was 15, and binged a lot. I quit a year ago and had been sober since. I have schizoaffective disorder, which is like bipolar and schizophrenia mixed. It causes a lot of psychosis. I also have ptsd from sexual assaults.

I decided to smoke a little bit of weed thinking it would be harmless about two months ago. Then without me noticing that I was falling back into my old habits, I smoked every night so I could feel better. I got back home after visiting my parents and smoked some weed with my partner. It triggered a five hour long episode of psychosis and PTSD flashbacks. It was excruciatingly terrifying. My entire body was shaking and I could hear millions of voices threatening me.

I?m fine now, and I haven?t smoked weed since. I?m just really upset at myself and guilty for relapsing. It was so hard for me to quit stimulants, and now I have to go through the whole process again. I?m really upset with myself. Also, I knew the dangers of smoking weed with my diagnosis, but I recklessly did it anyway. I?m ashamed. I don?t know what to do.",Addiction
"Thoughts are just rolling off the tip of my fingers here, but please stick with me. Addiction started at 15 born fast forward 15 years. I have many resources in addiction, at 17 methadone I was put on methadone, and benzodiazepines I stayed clean for five years and was a normal guy, to some degree..

2015 my addiction came back full blown I started using again with things to cut threw the mmat treatment since then things haven't been the same. I quit the union and decided to go back to being a full time addict. Multiple rehab attempts and failed detoxs things are finally starting to stick my periods of sobriety are now getting longer while uses become shorter.

But in today's society everyone just looks down on these types of things. For the longest time I had a hard time trusting men, so I only focused on women. I have managed to build relationships with men who I can confide in but I still feel like I'm missing something it's like my inner child is kicking me down.

I have been told to voice what I'm feeling even if I repeat the same things x amount of times a day to the same person.

Anyone else have this type of experience in early recovery? 30 days and I slip 60 something days I slip 4 months I slip 6 months I slip.. just writing this out I can see the process.",Addiction
"I first want to say if you are in recovery, I am wishing you all the best. Whatever stage you are in, keep going.

I have never had a first hand experience with substance use disorder or addiction. I have watched many loved ones suffer with this illness and it has hurt me greatly.

To make a long story short and give as little detail as possible, for therapy for the sake of my healing I had to write a letter to the addict in my life who is currently in the first few months of recovery. It feels selfish to even write this letter because I want their recovery to come first but at the same time, I?m hoping that it helps me and my loved one. I know people with addiction are most likely aware of how they hurt the ones who love them but while addicts suffer, their friends and family also suffer immensely. Maybe more than people realize.

I?m feeling really nervous about this letter because I don?t want to say anything that is insensitive or makes it sound like I am putting myself first. I want to get across all the ways that I have been hurt but also make it clear that I know that it is not this person?s fault. While they have hurt me so badly, I will still be here for every step of their recovery.

I?m wondering if anyone will be kind enough to be willing to basically proof read this for me and make sure I am being courteous and aware of their suffering while also making my points clear. I could send it in a PM and edit out names or personal info. I don?t want to say anything that will be harmful to their recovery. I will warn you first, the letter is long and depressing but writing it has helped a bit and I think them reading it would help me even more.",Addiction

"90 days and cravings are the strongest yet
I've basically been fighting shitty mental health (suicidal thoughts and extreme anxiety) for the last 3 months. I'm so proud of myself for not giving in to drugs when I've felt the lowest I have ever , but something about 90 days has bought about extreme cravings.

My brains starting to convince itself that because im coming off my prescription drugs (and I get extreme wd anxiety) , I should just do it quickly and take a few valiums to get it over with. I'm pretty sure that's a mix of the drug addict in me and my extreme impatient but it sucks.

I've also got covid and I think that's a trigger due to wanting to pop some benzos and chill in bed all day.

Guess im just venting. I'm staying clean cause I can't deal with the ""what if"" - as in , ""what if I pushed through and my mental health started to better itself, what if""",Addiction
"A Song I Made About My Fathers Addiction
I grew up not knowing that my dad was the only one in his family to make it out of ""the hood"". He held that from me for a long time. He worked hard and it always felt like i always had what i wanted. Growing up he was there for me, and i thought nothing could get in the way between us. Sadly when i was in 9th grade he got addicted to Meth and my whole life changed. Anyways. I made a song about some of the struggles ive had since then. Feel free to check it out!

"This is my first post into this group however I've been lurking about for sometime and taking a lot of good advice from other posts. I thought creating this post could help me with my recovery.

A little about me... 35 year old male relativity successful with regards to work running my own business, married last September and a one year old daughter which im very proud and happy about, on the face of it my life is great but i have a problem and my problem is cocaine. I was first introduced to coke as a 17 year old and have taken it ever since not huge amounts but continuous use over that period. I have noticed in particular over the past 2/3 years things are starting to become out of control (or even more out of control). Previously a friday into Saturday would be my norm 1-3g depending what I had planned. Now it can be fri/sat/sun and midweek even during work. I seem to find any excuse to use ie. footballs on lets get a bag.... tested positive for Covid lets get a bag (no joke very shameful).

I have an association with alcohol and coke which I cant deny, right now to me they are one and the same if I drink I snort simple as that which means for the foreseeable future no alcohol. I am a little confused as to what my problem is... is both only the coke or is it alcohol? I have an understanding of being addicted to Alcohol as both my parents are recovering alcoholic's both been in recovery for over 28 years. I suppose in a way I'm ashamed that history is/has repeated itself and its something I was determined not to allow to happen. Due to this i haven't spoken to my parents on this subject as it feels completely shameful and i have let them down........ does anyone have any advice having this discussion with loved ones/parents?



I have consider CA/NA but for some reasons haven't found the confidence to get to a meeting either in person or online. I suppose it makes everything 'real' and that scares me, to be honest I feel ashamed to have to admit to family and friends i have an addiction... hard to put into words if that makes sense.



I am currently 19days without using cocaine and about 10 of alcohol which I'm delighted with, have spoken with my wife and have her support, going to the gym 4/5 times a week all of which is really helping me and keeping me focused, long term im hoping I can maintain this although I have an uneasy feeling about cravings and working through them.... esp out with friends whist drunk as coke is freely available and in abundance. Again any useful help or advice on this or anything else would be greatly received and much apricated.",Addiction

"He's been an addict on and off for many years. He is not my biological brother, but was raised with me as such, essentially. As a teenager, he moved in with my alcoholic mother and I during a period he was struggling with his use. My mom left me with lots of PTSD always worrying about her ODing, and my brother did too (frequently nodding out in the bathroom to the point of being unresponsive, but not overdosed). My mom passed earlier this year, and Ive been on a long and difficult journey to work through my trauma from life since. My brother showed up unannounced three days ago at 2 am, homeless and needing a safe place. I took him in and have helped him get the basics (showered, fed, clean clothes). Its day three, and I was able to get him to go help my grandmother for money, and only now sitting alone do I feel the decompression and stress coming off. I felt like I was disassociated and in a trance while he was here; I trade stocks and crypto and I was making terrible choices and not using my proper trading tools I know I have, lost 30% in the three days from not managing my risk appropriately. A small example, but I feel that Im so occupied by trying to keep calm and use my DBT skills to avoid having a PTSD episode that I cannot function in the ways I need to do be both productive and content. I suffer from chronic depression among other issues, and building/taking part in a ""life worth living"" is essential to keep the worst of my symptoms at bay. Productivity is a large part of this for me.

I love my brother so much, however, we both have had hard lives and Im still doing my best to get my stuff sorted out, alone, at 22. I have no family support outside of my grandmother, and she is not well off and helps with things like extra food and basic supplies if I cant manage due to bills. I missed a shift at work the next morning because i didn't know what kind of mindset he was in, and many people who know addicts also know addiction can drive people to make morally unaligned choices; with a history of stealing, I couldnt risk having what little I have taken from me by him, let alone knowing the negative emotional impact it would have also had on him to betray me (hes a very caring person). I barely slept the past few days, always monitoring his breathing when hes nodding off on my couch. It's just too much for me at this moment to have him staying with me, although he made it clear he wasn't trying to move in, and that he just needed a place to stay for a moment (happy to house him, hate to know my family is struggling).

I know I have to have the conversation with him addressing why he can't live here (out of respect for him, hes my family and deserves that understanding imo), but I feel like I need to have a conversation that lets him know that 1) I love him 2) I want to see him get help (all senses; not just addiction) 3) I want to see him do well 4) Im too young and going through too much of my own stuff to have the stress of seeing him daily in this condition, while he also needs my emotional and logical support figuring out how to navigate his situation.",Addiction

I try to structure my day so that I get a few jobs out the way and get to the Gym or out for exercise, but at the end of the day I realise I'm actually structuring that day around time playing games. It doesn't get in the way of work particularly, but I am at a stage in my life where I am getting over the midway point and I really don't want to look back on my life and think I spent it hunched over a computer moving pixels around for some kind of hypnotic boredom suppressant. This is essentially how I spent my university years. Looking back at it I can't help but think I totally wasted that period when I could have been out making friends and meeting girls I was just sat on my own.

I guess the reason I'm posting here is I can't decide whether procrastination is the real addiction I have, or whether it's games. Certainly games seem to be the thing I turn to the second I am alone with free time, but if I left them out of my life would it be any better? Or would I just turn to another equally pointless hobby? Has anyone here experienced this and moved on? Or is it something I shouldn't worry about?",Addiction

Courage is this special ability that you have within yourself to fight for something that you value above everything else in this world. Courage is what you see in the movies you watch, the books you read or the video games you play when the hero defeats the vilain at the end.

Every aspect of your life is designed for you to find your true path. Every good or sad events that ever occurred in your life and the way you dealt with these situations should tell you a little bit more about yourself and what you stand for.",Addiction

When I was 18 years old an odd friendship I had in high school with someone that saw me as that weird dude that hangs out with Christian rock band kids and someone I saw as someone with parents that weren?t strict like mine turned into an adult friendship and I was quickly introduced to my worst best friend for the next 15 years alcohol. My disease got worse over the years, turned into a cocaine habit followed by a binge on various psychedelics, one of which (psilocybin) had the accidental effect of temporarily shutting off my addictive desire for alcohol and coke and everything else for that matter. I experienced a strange sense of peace for the first time in my adult life for a short time, but I didn?t do anything to look at the underlying issues, I didn?t stop going to the same bars, or hanging out with the same people, and I did not change my life in any way except not drinking. So, obviously when the mushroom effects wore off, I immediately gave in to my first craving and was back where I was alcoholic wise within a week as if I had never put it down. I got fired from my job, kicked out of my apartment again and found myself homeless for the 2nd time in 2 years.i went on like this for a couple of months before realizing that after tasting sober life, I wanted it for real this time. I called an inpatient facility in a completely different city, I left my drinking friends behind for good, and most importantly,

I was willing to do whatever it took to get and stay clean from all addictive substances.

No matter what that meant, no matter how hard it was, no matter how much I had to change my life Or what amount of work I needed to put into it or how vulnerable or uncomfortable aspects of recovery made me, I knew I had to dive in 100% willing and ready to work. Because that?s what it takes. There is no silver bullet. No one thing that will keep you sober. It?s a dedication and a drive to doing everything in your power to stay clean and make a better life than you had when you were getting high/drunk. That?s all.",Addiction

"I don?t know where the best subreddit to ask this question is but I figured this is the best place to start.

If you guys could help me in any way, I?d appreciate it so much. Here?s some context.

For many years my brother has struggled on and off with addiction. Whether that be pills, weed, cocaine and basically every drug there is. Some I have never heard of. For the past 4 months he cleaned up his act, got clean, went to work again and the gym. He moved in with me to get away from our toxic father who we no longer speak to. He was doing very well but with covid and more lockdowns coming back he relapsed very recently. I lightly tried to confront him about it as it?s quite obvious when he?s using. He eventually tearfully admitted to me he relapsed and we had a heart to heart conversation about it. When he uses he won?t talk to me as much, avoid me even. He disappears for long periods and irregular times of the day/night. And with a lot of the drugs he takes- especially cocaine, he can get very aggressive. It scares me.

I thought after our conversation about his relapse things may start to look up. They?ve only gotten worse. He?s gone back to self isolation, disappearing and tonight he was set off by a very small thing and screamed at me.

It hurts me so much to see him like this. When he?s on drugs, he becomes someone I don?t recognize and now I feel afraid to come talk to him about anything with how aggressive he can get.

So I?m asking you guys. What else can I do? Should I keep trying to talk to him? Should I give him space right now? I know he can only really get clean by himself but I need to know I am doing everything in my power to help him.

I?m sorry for the long essay. I?m losing my mind with the thought of losing him, he?s the most important person in the world to me. Thank you for your time.",Addiction

"I don't know how to react to my bf hiding his substance abuse. I am 36f, bf is 41m.

We have been together 2.5yrs. We live together with his two kids who he has half time. When we met my bf was recently out of a long term relationship, and I knew he was struggling with depression. We took it slow. He was upfront about substance abuse issues he had in his past. My understanding was his use of hard drugs (cocaine, benzos, opioids) was in the past. I knew he drank alcohol heavily, but over our first year or so together he moderated his drinking, phasing out liquor and sticking to a few a few beers a night. It seemed like he was working on himself and making positive changes. We moved in together around the 1yr mark.

Since we moved in together I have occasionally noticed some odd behavior. Nothing extreme, but constricted pupils, lethargy, difficulty maintaining an erection. And I mostly chalked them up to stress since my bf has a full time job, takes care of his kids etc. But the last six months I have become increasingly suspicious. My bf had some financial issues (nothing catastrophic, but smallish amounts of money missing, short on rent that sort of thing), I noticed the constricted pupils more frequently... I grew up around addiction and I just had that feeling something was off. I know people struggling with addiction can be high functioning, and it got harder for me to ignore the things I was seeing.

So I snooped through an old cell phone (I know, I'm embarassed). I found out he was using heavily when we first met and had been struggling since to slow and stop his use. But also saw that he had been in regular contact with his dealer up until the present. I have since looked over our shared cell phone bill and see they regularly communicate despite my bf saying they are no longer friends. This weekend I noticed the signs I associate with potential use, saw he been texting his dealer, and asked my bf if there was anything, anything at all, going on with him. Anything I didn't know about. I did not get specific, and he denied anything was going on. This morning I looked in his pants pocket and found a baggie with a hollowed out pen and some white residue.

I love my bf. He is a kind, gentle person. He takes care with my feelings. I truly thought we were honest with each other. I can't get my mind around the fact that he hid this from me. He knows I grew up around drugs and addiction, and lost a parent to an overdose. The most generous interpretation I have is he didn't want to scare me off. I also know his use stems from his traumatic childhood (he experienced physical, sexual, and emotional abuse). And he might have been too deeply ashamed to tell me.

But all that being said I still don't know what to do. My bf is high functioning, and if I didn't grow up around drugs I may not have noticed. I do feel intense guilt for snooping, but also don't regret it. I felt like I was projecting my own trauma with substance abuse onto him, but it's clear now I'm not.

I know we need to talk about it...but what is the best way to start that conversation? What boundaries should I be prepared to draw? Should I consider leaving? This seems to be the common advice, but it would be so hard for me. I believe he is a wonderful person who struggles to cope. Should I ask that he get treatment? My fear is things will spiral for him. He has some level of control now, but we that always be the case? And I just don't know if I can get past the dishonesty. That is what hurts the most. I worry I will always feel like is lying to me.

I fucked it up. I figured I would be fine just using the one time. FIRST MISTAKE. Now 6 months later it's been back to my daily use. I need it again to feel normal.

The thing is weed help me a lot dealing with high anxiety; but I can feel that my physical health don't stop getting worse. So for now before I can buy a sort of vape but for weed ( can't remember the name), I want to smoke only on the weekend. But I don't feel capable, it's been so long since I went sober for more than one day, I afraid of so many thing and I know that it will be only a struggle for one week (I used to stop smoking frequently, so I know my experiences on getting sober), but what if I don't care like always and continue ?

"He hasn't used regularly in years and has now hit the one-year mark since his last ""slip up."" He has lost so many of the friends he was in treatment with either to overdose or suicide - I think 6 in the last year. Two of the best friends he'd made in treatment died on the same day last year--even though they'd never met--February 4th, 2021. It makes me so fucking sad for my partner, the families of the victims, and everyone affected by this epidemic. I fucking hate it.

All that said, I'd really like to make sure we're occupied on Feb 4th. Does anyone have ideas about how we can give back? Volunteering opportunities to help struggling/recovering addicts, people experiencing homelessness, or troubled teens? Or any other ideas for what to do on that day?",Addiction

I still chase the feeling of getting high, with cigarettes, porn and meeting with hookers. I can?t really talk about that with anyone.

Me and another person put our poems about addiction on this subreddit and we both took it down bc all we got was hate from others and dumb comments about using Capital letters too much. I thought this was supposed to be a group that supports each other and lifts one another up and tells another person how brave they are for spilling their heart and soul on here only to get hated on and judged. Some of the reasons I started using to begin with. WHERE IS THE LOVE? WHERE IS THE SUPPORT? WHERE IS THE SENSE OF COMMUNITY? It?s sad. It hurts. And it makes me lose my faith in humanity. IM SORRY IF MY CAPITAL LETTERS PISS ANYONE OFF TOO BTW. I KNOW IT CAN BRING OUT THE WORST IN PEOPLE! I would never want to hurt someone else who is hurting. Or judge someone who feels judged already.

"Hey everyone, first post here Title kinda says it all. I've wrestled with alcoholism since I was 16, (now 28) and have within the last 5 years become helplessly addicted to cocaine.

I wish i could say im over it but the sample size of being without it isnt too big. However, if my words can help someone get 1 week off whatever the fuck their hooked on itll be worth the post.

Im gonna enumerate some points.

You gotta commit to not using (i know the voice in the back is real but you gotta get the intention out loud if you have to and be incisive about the decision

You might have to hit rock bottom in order to get to the point you really decide to change. IT MIGHT BUT IT DOESNT HAVE TO.

Write it down. All the feelings and things this substance does to you. All the pros and cons. You will see there are no pros. How its just fucking up your life in exchange of nothing. 15 minutes of euphoria that you can get doing anything pleasurable which takes me to number 4.

Change your habits. Triggers can get you falling right back into it, so change habits and know why you are doing so. Go for a run, drink a lot of water, take a shower, read a book, go to work, start a project. Occupy your mind.

The first days are the most difficult. It gets easier, the bad withdrawals get softer.

Remember why you are changing your life. Cuz yoy love yourself man! You dont deserve having ur life, friens, family, jobs being taken away from you over this shit. Remember the ppl who make it dont give a fuck about you!!! If youre dead or alive dont mean shit to them. I guess ur better alive tho, living like a zombie and consuming their substance getting addicted more and more.

Practice a connection with the divine. Im serious !!! Whether its yoga, shamanism, catcholicism, evangelism. Doesnt matter! Have faith in something. Find yourself. Purify your house. Clean it up. Clean yourself up. Breathe the air. Love yourself.

Write down everyday what you are grateful for. Seriously, do it!!! Your family? Your dog? Friends? Write it down. Be grateful. Open your heart. Wish the best for yourself. YOU CAN DO IT. I CAN DO IT. WE CAN DO IT.

I wish everyone power of will, strength and determination. It may not look or feel like it but we're in this together. A lot of ppl have conquered it, and we can do it. Live a better life. Enjoy the simple things and most importantly FEEL INNER PEACE. These are my opinions tho!!! I dont want anyone to think im trying to shove my truth in anyones face. I hope it helps. GOD LOVES YOU!!!!",Addiction

"I detoxed for the 3rd God damn time at the beginning of the month. Im an opiate user. But the last 7 years or so I've been on methadone. Something happened and I blamed the methadone and stopped taking it and started using again because the detox off of methadone is a fucking bitch.

I held my shit together for months. No one knew. Then my job shut down for a week. No money no drugs. So after being so sick for 2 days, I went to detox on Jan 3rd. Barely remember the first few days and when I got out I didn't feel right. I chocked that up to being dehydrated and hungry and slept deprived. I hadn't really eaten or drank since the day I got sick or slept. Ended up leaving detox on the 6th day and trying to do the right thing I went to rehab.

I lasted 3 full days before I left. First rehab and it was an awful one. But at that point I hadn't slept more than an hour or two a night since I first got sick. Still hadn't eaten since before detox and I had to force my self to drink at least a little. I had no motivation. So I started telling myself was that I just needed sleep. So thats why I went home. Because my mental clock is off and I sleep better during the day, always have.

Took some doing but I convinced my mom to let me leave. I went home and actually managed to eat and grab a few hours of sleep. Next day I still felt awful. Figured thats to be expected. My sleep debt is enormous and I know there's an adjustment period before sleep would become regular. But I thought the emptiness I was feeling, the fog would have at least lifted a little...

So I did a little research into how long it takes for dopamine to start being released naturally again in addicts. Yeah, wish I hadn't done that. 3 months is the low mark. For people using a long time could be over a year.

I'm a tough mother fucker. Been through a lot. Too much for someone my age. But this. This indifference to everything that I've been feeling? This is unlike anything I've ever gone through. I've been on the couch since I got home. If my mom didn't feed me I wouldn't feed myself. Im still barely sleeping at all and if I'm being painfully honest I haven't even fucking showered since I got home. Theres no motivation to do anything. Nothing.

Everytime you feed yourself, drink something, anything to take care of yourself, your brain gives you a hit of dopamine to reinforce the behavior. Did you know that?? Because i didn't. I would have done things differently. Get back on methadone at least and get off it slowly I guess. Idk, but it sure as fuck wouldn't have been this. But my mom doesn't want me on methadone again. Truly I don't want to be on anything, but I'm so done but this emptiness. I can't live like this.

My body no longer knows how to function without some type of opiate. Thats fucking terrible. Sitting my heart rate is at 90. Can't sleep. And all sort of other shitty shit. But you know what, I can deal with my body freaking out. Like I said, I'm tough. But when there's no longer any care about or for anything how do you deal with that. My mind, the very essence of me is just broken.

Theres no way to understand the feeling if you've never felt it. Its not like depression where there's a dull ache. The pain beneath the surface that robs you of your interests and motivation, your will for life. I've been depressed most of my life and fuck if I don't want it back. Just to feel something. Anything. Pain. Anger. Sorrow. Despair even. I would kill to feel any one of those. Good feelings are just a dream now.

Worst part is, I have a paycheck waiting for me at my last job and some tips. I don't want to use but I don't know how much longer I can deal with this empty in the center of my chest. I just want to feel something. I've always been so passionate and energetic, I want to feel like myself. Not a stranger in my body.

I know this is super fucking long, and if you stuck around I appreciate it.

But I'm looking for some one that has been through what I'm going through now. I need to know that it's possible to get through this. Because, I don't know how much more of this I got in me. I just need encouragement and understanding from someone that understands really how awful this is.",Addiction

"I really need some advice I feel completely at a loss and I don?t know what I can do about it.

Me and my boyfriend have been together just over a year he?s 33 and I?m 25.

I have personally never done any hard drugs (I tried weed a few times when I was a teen) I didn?t enjoy it at all, I do however like to have a glass of wine on a Saturday night whilst at home and will drink when I go out with friends.

However he has been smoking weed ever since he was 12, he says he?s not addicted to weed however he has a joint in the morning as soon as he wakes up, lunch breaks at work and then he?ll have atleast 4 in the evenings. On his days off he smokes even more.

He also does cocaine atleast once a week to my knowledge he has said to me he has a problem with it before but he could stop if he wants too, but every Saturday night without fail he does cocaine just whilst we?re at home, if he has some leftover the next morning he will sniff it when he wakes up. He said it?s easier that way because then he can?t do it the next night. (I have suggested to just put it in the bin if there?s leftovers) he just shrugged.

I have also meant him money in the passed which he hasn?t paid back, I?m not concerned about the money it?s more I just don?t want to be in a position where I?m funding his addiction.

He said there?s absolutely no way he?ll ever stop smoking weed and that he hates doing cocaine but he won?t stop (he?s got a hole in the middle of his nose from this)

I don?t know what to do, he?s so fine with it I don?t think he even knows or cares it?s a problem, I haven?t said anything about it to him because I don?t want him to feel bad, but I?m at a complete loss of what to do. Part of me feels that because he doesn?t think it?s an issue and finds it funny how many drugs he?s done/does it makes me think it?s not as bad as it is.

"Man I don?t know. I struggle with the mental battle of addiction. My drugs of choice to abuse are Xanax and kratom because they self medicate my anxiety and depression. I have become a lot better recently with my usage. Going extended periods of time sober. I fully quit smoking weed. I?m working on my issues in a healthy way and trying to improve myself, my life and my relationships. But I still cave in. Have done a little Xanax and kratom this week. It hasn?t become habitual.. or ever really. The worst I would do would be to binge Xanax for a 2-4 week period nightly and then stop because I didn?t want to get physically addicted. So yeah, I?m not physically addicted to anything.. but drugs are still an issue for me because they allow me to escape my distress and problems temporarily.. only for them to come back stronger in the future. Don?t know why I?m posting this but whatever. Just disappointed in myself because I know I need to be fully sober to fully heal myself, but I give into the cravings here and there",Addiction

"okay so its not really serious but its been messing with me for a few months now my life started going shit again in november (family stuf), since then i started taking more antidepressants than my psychiatrist prescribed me to, Im 18yo and was prescribed 1 pill a day but when i feel super maniac i take even up to 4 a day (4 a day is maximum for an adult cause I don't wanna actually fuck my health system) also everytime I started panicking outside my house (so i don't have access to my meds) i ask people if they have painkillers and lie that I have a headache, but in reality i just feel better when im on them which doesn't make sense cause i know they cant make you high.

there was a month where i took painkillers regularly everyday even tho nothing hurt me (strong ones) again- they don't get ne high or anything (i think) but I feel the need to take them now its never enough i don't have a problem but i srsly don't know what to do",Addiction

I've been ungrateful for my time freely given upon the Earth, I've made an entangled mess of regret and irrational hopes of rebirth, I never do my research, I always wanna be first.

Fooled again by a weakened mind state, not a victim of my decisions just a pleading of my minds race with time n fate. I might become another personality entirely, reality to be inviting me...

"I believe that mental addictions (such as gambling, food, sugar, sex, or cannabis dependence) are still chemically addictive like other drugs. Here's my 2 cents: I have a lot of experience with cannabis use, as it took up a large portion of my life (I'll share my story on that in another post later this week). While being milder and less harmful, Cannabis/THC trains the brain to withhold the release of natural pleasure chemicals, like Dopamine, and only release them once you give in to temptation. Same thing can happen with food, sugar, or sex.

If you feed the addiction long enough, it takes more effort to retrain the brain to no longer be dependent on external stimuli to trigger production or release of neurochemicals.",Addiction

"I am a 58yo woman happily married for 20 years (2nd marriage for both) to my 59 yo husband. He is the greatest person I?ve known. He?s raised my boys since they were 4 and 6 years old and he considers them his kids (with the blessing of my ex who is also involved with our kids). He is the best thing that has ever happened to us. He is the kind of guy who will drop anything to help out in any situation. My boys would call him with any problem instead of their dad. My problem is that I?m a recovering alcoholic, pill popper. Now I do need medication to control my anxiety and panic attacks. I have a prescription for .05mgs of klonopin that may be taken as needed but only 3times a day max. Now I know that I cannot have these pills in this amount around me because I know I will take them even if I think I may get anxiety later on. That?s the truth and the addict in me. So I had a long talk with my husband and explained my situation as best I could to someone who never even thinks of pills. I ask him to please give me 3 pills in the morning. Just leave them on bathroom counter or in a small bottle. It helps me maintain and really think before I take a pill. I asked him to please keep them away someplace, anywhere ? seriously don?t want to see the bottle because I get triggered. Hard to explain this to someone that doesn?t have an addicts brain.

"So I?ve always been interested in drugs, since I was a kid. I didn?t realize I had anxiety until I had my first Xanax at 20 years old. I thought everybody felt nervous like that all the time. Deadass.

So specifically, the drugs that turned me to rehab were cocaine and benzos (Xanax, flualprazolam, klonopin, Valium, clonazolam, etc.) I finished the inpatient program after 4 months. I was extremely confident that I never needed drugs again.

Originally I?m from California but my parents moved to Texas when I was 19 and living on my own.

After rehab, I moved to Texas (I was 24 now) and well wouldn?t you know it, your addiction follows you anywhere. I found coworkers and met friends with coke plugs, xans, acid, etc. I moved to get away from the people, places, and things that spiraled me into a full blown addict, owing drug dealers money and stealing from my own family. But I was back at it and HARD. I convinced my best friend to leave CA to TX and get an apartment with me and my bf. He is a polydrug user as well (my bf doesn?t do drugs or drink at all), and it didn?t take long to get into the spiral of doing coke everyday, having to take a shitload of Xanax to counteract the negative effects of the coke. On and on it went. Well things went south with my best friend and we moved out of the apartment after 5 months and my best friend couldn?t afford it on his own, so we were left to our own devices. My bf (who I met in TX) had his mom and sister living in Colorado and they offered to help us get on our feet. So we did. After my year in Texas on a drug induced binge, me and my bf move to Colorado. Well one of my friends from TX was also from CO and had just moved back. As a polydrug user herself, I found plugs for coke again and started buying RC benzos even more. Then I got a klonopin script on top of all that. So my benzo use has been off the fuckin rails. I?ve wrecked 3 cars, cussed out my mom, and went on road trips I don?t even remember.

I began attending NA (virtual thanks to COVID) meetings and kept that up for a couple months. All it took was one bad day and I was asking my friend for coke. She had multiple plugs and it was just like the old times again. Back on coke binges and just being a total bitch when I didn?t have it. Then comes the benzos (which I take daily), because even when I?m not using that day, my anxiety is THAT high. I?m halfway through my month?s RX of klonopin and I got it a week ago. Now I?ve turned to alcohol, often mixing it with benzos. I know the risks but I do it anyways. I can?t stand the feeling of being sober and I don?t know why. When I got out of rehab I stayed clean another 4 months, 8 months total. But here I am, stuck in the spiral no matter what state I move to. It?s the addict brain I guess.

My question is, where do I move on from here? I have a job I love and don?t want to (although I may need it) go to an inpatient rehab again. Not to mention my insurance in this state is more expensive and I?m not even sure how it would work here. I just need help. A shoulder to cry on and wonder why a smart girl who got into her dream college and dropped out chose drugs and stealing over the bright future I could have had. Now I?m 26.

I need help and I finally realize that (AGAIN) now. Oh and I got to experience alcohol withdrawals for the first time. Used a shitload of benzos and that was barely enough to feel better. Wasn?t until I drank some whiskey that I felt better. I?m broken and slipping backwards. At a super fast pace.",Addiction

However I still suffer from occasional depression and anxiety. Covid doesn't help. Right now I'm going through a break up and I haven't been in this much emotional pain in such a long time. I've been with the same person for 5 years and I thought they were the one. I wanted to marry them, have kids and buy a house next year. We had it all planned out.
But we're too different and we're ending things. I feel like a part of me is missing. And I've been craving weed like crazy. I'm having constant dreams about smoking, I even bought CBD weed
I wasted 5 years of my life smoking weed, I will never return to that way of life. I'm so much more productive now, but God this heart break is killing me. And weed makes me really euphoric
So I smoked a cigar today. I don't smoke or vape. But I needed to smoke something.

The last time smoke entered my lips, I was smoking my last joint which caused me to have a seizure because it was laced. 2 and a half years ago
I feel silly. Blowing on tobacco on my front porch. But it took care of my craving. Watching the smoke leave my mouth and drift into the night sky somehow made me less depressed. It gave me the instant gratification I've been longing for.

And that's it. Im on here, reminding myself Ill never smoke weed again. Ill never stoop that low again. Ill get rid of the CBD weed and other shit Ive been holding onto and just smoke stupid cigars when I am at an emotional rock bottom.",Addiction

She said she needs help but she?s been to detox clinics and has been trying to get sober for years and years and she can?t. She said she walks down the road and people come up to her and give her heroin for free. She lost custody of 6 children. I always had major resentment toward her, I hated her until recently. Now I?m starting to feel sympathy. I can?t imaging what she is going through and I just feel like she is going to die soon and there?s nothing I can do. I feel like I mourn my mother all the time and she?s still alive. Idk if there?s a better place to talk about this but idk if anyone can say anything that might help.",Addiction

Life is a blur and i feel detached almost all the time. Im almost out of weed and once i run out i plan on keeping it that way, but having tried this before i know its easier said than done, i smoke to cope at this stage and some days it feels like its all that keeps me going.

My mother in law; his mother is enabling his addiction. She sends him money daily for whatever he needs (drugs, alcohol) She does it behind his fathers back and she told me she would stop in the new year and she hasn?t. Now he hasn?t worked since our daughter has been born and she tells me she will give him ultimatums, pay for him to go to treatment; I just don?t understand how she says she wants to help him but she keeps enabling him. He will never go get help if she continues what she is doing in my eyes.

"Don?t laugh at me? I?ve smoked weed for about 7 years since I was 14. My whole family smoked with me and my mother and older brother were always very drug conscious, not careless at all. Only allowing me to smoke weed anything else was off limits. Anyways my mother passed away suddenly when I was in the house with her, from a heart attack. She was standing and cooking and cleaning just hours before. So it was extremely traumatizing watching her fall out in the floor, turn blue, and stop breathing when we had a conversation not 20 minutes before. I?m pretty young to be losing my mother and I?ve been extremely depressed since because my whole life was flipped upside down went from living in a big house with my whole family to living with my girlfriend in her dads house. I have had a psychological dependence on weed for a while now. But I can confidently classify it as an addiction at this point as I?ve tried to stop multiple times to no avail.

Basically, I?ve been living for about a year completely depressed and hopeless, and became a pothead six months ago in response. Just last week I snapped and decided to turn my life around, and I?ve been seeing a therapist and taking care of myself and pursuing my goals successfully since then.

Thing is, on days like today I?m bored and just have a bunch of housework to do (and a game to watch!), and would absolutely love to do so while high. I only stopped smoking because it was holding me back from taking care of myself, but since I already committed to turn my life around and I am seeing a therapist, in touch with my friends about it, etc., I don?t think there?s much of a danger in me returning to my old ways if I smoke a few times a month, just for fun.

Obviously, though, it?s possible I?m biased and will revert to depression and waste my life if I allow myself to smoke even occasionally, Or if I restart too soon (it?s only been a week, but sooooo much has changed in that week)

"I gave up these badboys when I was 30, in that I gave up smoking it all day, every day. But then I was drinking and eating (like a monster) then too - and just very unaware of any of my coping mechanisms, (pre autism & adhd diagnosis & general self discovery on the next level...)

I've curbed it all now, finally, at 33, except I had a bit of an emotional meltdown in November and smoked for a good six weeks, came off after Christmas, then my grandma immediately went into hospital and then died at the end of January, so I kinda just carried on smoking almost constantly and HEAVILY for three months.

I've been smoking these ungodly amounts and have known it was going to really sling me into a bad, bad place when i stopped... and we are here now. I'm done again because I can't do it in moderation, my lungs are absolutely fried before I even manage to get a hit after say the fourth or fifth joint. Its expensive and unsustainable and doesn't align well with my current spiritual values. Weed blew me wide open and changed so much, but that use became abuse and I just needed to move forward.

Anyway what i am really here for is possibly, hopefully reassurance from people who understand.... Addiction is just the hardest thing I've ever, ever, ever dealt with. Trauma as a child, then the double whammy of autism ritual joy and then adhd emotional management and all that comes with that... it makes things utterly impossible to do like a normal person. I don't have any addicty friends these days and am really struggling to speak to someone who gets it....

So now of course I'm totally raw and feeling everything. I slept for 2 days straight, and coming out of that I managed to have a great session on the drums and a big walk, however, I'm on day 3 now I think and I just feel absolutely, absolutely terrible, mentally and emotionally?

I'm functioning and flowing through life like a melancholy ghost but irritable beyond belief, of course all the usual silliness of withdrawal, but then there's the existential dread that is just making me feel like a perpetually short fusing circuit that's about to be sucked into a black hole.

It's clawing away at me through my upper back, I feel panicky, just, this complete existential, awful, terrible, just terrible, terrible feeling....

Smoking will make it all go away but then it will come back worse, so I can't possibly prolong the inevitable any longer...

Please god, is there anyone out there with some grounding, earthing, reassuring, understanding, motivating words to help me through this. I can't remember how long this lasts... am I going to be okay??

One 30-60 bottle of booze every two weeks is cheaper than 100 therapy every week. I do realize this probably all sounds like excuses; but I have a full time job and am being a full time college student. I can keep my room clean and watch the kids. I can do all the things I ""need"" to. But I can't do anything else. I can't make myself study things I enjoy or exercise. I know this probably sounds stupid but I cannot go to rehab. I'm living with family right now and if I go to rehab I would lose my house, job, and possibly fall behind on school. I do turn to alcohol but I try my best to restrict myself to once a week. Pleas, anybody, tell me how I can manage this. I have to survive another 3 years at least before I can live on my own and seek help. What works best, medicine? Idk yoga? Is there even anything I can afford... Whatever advice pleas send it my way I am eternally grateful.",Addiction

"for context ive been smoking weed regulary (every few days, if not everyday) for the past 3 years. i went through an alcohol addiction for 5 months also where i went on frequent weekly benders. now i?ve moved onto ecstasy and i?ve used it around 8 times, usually taking 2 or 3 pills at a time, during the past 3 months.

my memory has always been pretty bad and i suspect it?s due to substance use. now though, my sense of time is completely warped ? i took 3 pills and smoked 3g bud on saturday and ever since that everything goes incredibly slow, like everyday for the past 3 days have been awful. i don?t feel real either. ive suffered with severe anxiety which usually causes derealisation but recently it has been very extreme.

"It all started with lemon beer when I was really young, like younger than 16, and then a few cigarettes a day, fast forward, I had coffee and cigs every day for years until I was 23 or 24?

And last year, after restricting too much, I've had more chocolate than ever even if I used to have it often before too. But like it got to the point that one day couldn't pass without it. I am 26 now and I am still cig-free and have successfully cut out all sugar without craving it as much as I did last time I've quit sugar for like 10 days straight I can say. But I've started cutting it out since January 1, gradually. Cause chocolate is hard to quit. Sugar from bread is not really.

"What addiction really is
Addiction is a constant reminder, after months or even decades continuing. Addiction is awesome, it feels good but you just don?t know it yet: the consequences that is. Addiction is harmful, you know it isn?t right. But it feels good, and you?re confident. Addiction is unhealthy, if you keep going, but you know it if you keep at it, it?s something that ruined people?s futures. Addiction is realized, you realize you?re addicted , but it feels good so you don?t really care. Addiction is now part of your life, being addicted has become a part of your personality.

"So yea, basically what the title says. I?m only 18, and I never thought I would be going thru with this but I?m thinking of going NC with my dad. To start off I?m sorry about the bad formatting, I?m on mobile. Onto the story. I have been low contact with my dad for about a year now, only talking to him when needed. I?ll drive him somewhere if he needs a ride (his vehicle got taken cause he didn?t pay it off), I?ll go to family gatherings with him, but I haven?t asked him to hang out like we used to in over a year. About 3 years ago, he dumped his ex (not my mom). She was a heavy meth user (only towards the end of their relationship as far as I know) but it was only clear to me she was on meth after they broke up. I would see her around town skinnier than me (I?m 100lbs) and she used to be fairly big (no larger than 300lbs) when dating my dad. I also know the effects of meth, as I?ve had other family members who use it, and it was clear she was addicted. The meth was a major reason for the break up, and only a very small amount was because of the way she treated me and my sister. She was so rude to us, she would call us names and act as if the house was hers (it was 100% in my dads name and she didn?t make enough money to pay rent). I?m not going to go into detail about her, because this post is about my dad. About 2 years ago it started getting bad. My dad would do ride share late at night and starting stealing my sisters car. Then about a year and a half ago, me and my sister found a crack pipe in her car (she does NOT use, there is no way it was hers or a friends). Ever since then he?s been on a downward spiral. First, he lost his 13 year old dogs this summer. Then, at the end of the summer, my sisters puppy got parvovirus and passed away (not even a year old). He was really close to her dog and was devastated when he passed away. Then, his truck got repo-ed from the bank from not paying for it for over 2 years! This next issue is why I?m making this post. 3 days ago, I gave him a ride to my sisters car to boost it so he can go out for the night. (It?s -40c here) He told my sister he would be back by noon the next day, so I thought nothing of it. He was very talkative when he was in my car, but I didn?t think he was high. After he boosts my sisters car, he leaves. Not to be heard of since 4 hours ago. My whole family was trying to get a hold of him, he made my sister late to work, and he didn?t give a shit. He was active on Facebook throughout the 3 days and no one got a reply. The only reason we know where he is is because he was caught by my stepdad rummaging through my sisters car a few blocks away from his current place. (I think it?s pretty clear why he was parking far away; he knew we were looking for him and didn?t want us to see her car at his house) He was high as a kite and said he wanted to ?gamble? one last time before New Years. Now I just don?t know what to do. No 18 year old should have to watch their dad go thru all this shit. I have seen friends go thru this stuff and once I can?t handle it I?ve cut them off but I don?t know if I can do that to my own dad. I haven?t talked to him yet, planning to on New Year?s Eve.

"I knew my older brother (24) has experimented with drugs when we were younger, but didn?t know how bad it was until about a year ago. He had a lot of medical issues, and had surgery on his arm for nerve pain. He has troubles sleeping and has a week immune system. On these meds post surgery, he was still taking Xanax and who knows what else. I found him overdosing at his computer with powder on his desk and a cut up straw. The ambulance came, and he was in the hospital for a few days.

My parents and i cleaned out his room because we were so worried after and found tons of things that we weren?t expecting: tons of bags, cut up straws, dmt residue, kratom, Xanax, heroin residue, etc.

It happened a second time at his girlfriends house a month later. She didn?t know about the severity of his drug use, she couldn?t bear to see him that way so they broke up, and she ended up moving into the apartment they signed a lease for, without him.

He agreed to see a psychologist, but he only went once and never returned. He seemed to be doing better, he was going to the gym a bit, spending quality time with my parents and myself (even though we weren?t close growing up). However we recently noticed a large number of new bags that had heroin in them popping up, he has very little money considering he makes a decent living and has little expenses, and today he said he has been having trouble sleeping and having very vivid nightmares that he was in jail. Hours after waking, he was still convinced that what had happened in his nightmares was real. He was convinced he was in jail despite the fact he hasn?t actually left the house in 3 days.

I guess what I?m saying is my parents and i are extremely worried. We love him very much, but how can we help? My parents find it difficult because they can?t exactly control him given that he?s 24, and they can?t monitor what he does. They don?t want to kick him out because that will make things worse. I understand that many people going through this sort of thing are not comfortable talking about it. I just want him to be better but don?t know how to help more than telling him i love him regularly and that I?m here for him anytime.

"This is my second time posting. I really need advice on how to help my niece, but honestly just the opportunity to unpack all my emotions here would be very helpful. I want to take a short trip back to four months ago. It was then my niece was fired from her management position, according to her account, for no reasons whatsoever. I was told there was a problem with time sheets. This never made any sense to me.It is a small town, so my nephew happened to stop in the business and said, ""hey whatever happened to the old manager she seemed nice?"" The new manager said the old manager was caught doing dope in the bathroom. When my nephew told me the information made total sense. It was after she was fired that she went back to work at an old job where her coworkers all abused opiates and after the crackdown they can't get scripts, so my fear is they're dabbling with the devil in heroin.

Over the months that followed after the firing I saw my niece drift further away from my nephew the two of them were always so close. This also meant she didn't visit me any longer and I knew it was a bad sign. I guess I blame myself a bit for not stepping up as soon as she was fired and pressing her for answers.My past experience tells me any pressing her will result in her taking this ""whoa is me I'm suffering attitude"" and ""I'm not using drugs I'm just tired."" So tired that she started dipping out asleep during the meal. I looked down the table with her mouth wide open full of food looking like an OD about to happen and I am helpless. The family that hosted dinner was scared for her and the next thing you know she is jumping in a car and driving away. Family pleaded with her not to drive, but she left intoxicated on drugs.

Cut to the next day. My nephew and me encourage my niece to come over and hangout. Niece declines and says she ""feels so bad"" she can't see anyone right now. We both assure her there is no need to feel bed just come hangout. My nephew and me were both trying to keep the dialogue open. My niece refused to come and her texts were long drawn out excuses why her being fucked up isn't her fault. My nephew makes the bold choice to talk to my brother and tell him, ""Can't you see that your daughter is fucked up on drugs?"" My brother in complete denial says, ""she said she was tired and I believer he. Back story is that my brothers wife is also dabbling with the pain pills and like mother like daughter (I feel such anger) I guess he doesn't see either of them fucked up.

The last family event before Thanksgiving (anniversary of my mother's passing away) it was my brothers wife that couldn't stand up to say a prayer making a scene on the beach while we tried to say a prayer. It was horrible, but I had empathy that she needed help. The problem is nobody is getting help. I wake up and want to text my niece, ""Are you safe?"" I really don't know what to do anymore because my niece doesn't want help. My niece wants to wallow in ""how her life was hard"" and ""she doesn't get any love from her parents"" and ""she is constantly wronged in jobs and that's why she isn't working. The girl is about two days away from being homeless. Here is where the advice kicks in...

What do I do when she's homeless and I don't feel safe having her in my home where there is Rx? She has stolen medications multiple times - the last years ago because I set her up and counted the pills before she came over. I am afraid for her that she'll overdose. I'm afraid I can't help her because she doesn't want help because she doesn't have a problem. She clearly has a problem dipping out in front of the whole family after she claimed to have looked forward to seeing family so much.

Did she show up fucked up as a way of shouting for help? My nephew asked about her getting help and she says ""she'll go see a doctor."" That doesn't work she needs to go into rehab because she has supposedly quit so many times - each time in rehab she found a way to sign herself out.

I pray this fits into the topic - I need to help my niece but she doesn't want the help, so what can you do? I took the previous advice and talked to family about the addiction and some are in denial and others just pulled back not knowing what to do. What can we possibly do?",Addiction

"So I (24f) was taking to my brother (18m) over thanksgiving break. He goes where I graduated from college at. He?s been really struggling in his classes. He has fully failed with a 1.87 gpa when he needs a 2.0. He will be on academic probation next semester to get his shit together. At the beginning of the semester he went crazy. He was only sober 5 days out of the first two and a half months he was there. One night he took 20 hits on a dab pen and had 5 cocktails. He realized he was failing so he stopped drinking. But he told us he was still smoking pot. (Which we do to so not a huge thing).

When he was here this week he told me that his girlfriend is on harder drugs. Not meth or heroine but cocaine and pills and stuff of that level. He said he only does the weed and pills. I asked what pills and he said adoral (he has adhd and had a prescription for it but I?m not sure that?s the only type he is taking) and Xanax.

I am super worried. His girlfriend does harder stuff and he has shown he will go crazy with things. But he also told me when I told him he needed to cut out partying and focus on school that he might as well drop out if he is just going to kill him self with school and not be social. What if he is doing worse things than what he told me? What if it escalates as finals come?

I am not sure if I should tel out parents. They have already said if they found out he was doing that stuff they would pull him out. And my mom is the type that would pull him pet way through the semester. Like find out drive down there move him out in two days time.

Also he trusted me to tell me this. I don?t want to break that trust in case something big happens. What if he needs help and feels like he can?t trust me? He told me point blank a year ago he doesn?t care if he has a big family as long as he has one of us or talk to he doesn?t care if he never sees the rest of us again. I could lose him. If I break his trust I could lose him.

"I was always interested in playing video games like any male kid I guess but the thing that started my path towards addiction was the first computer(well second since the first one was one of those old big slowpokes that we played solitaire and minsweeper on).
I was in 7th or 8th grade of elementary and it was supposed to be for school but it was prob the least about that - it was 60% gaming,20% porn,15% youtube/social media and that last 5% was for school.
My parents never really placed a limit on how much I(we - my brother and sisters) could be on it and so of course we were on it the whole day.
It was fun,thinking about those endless hours of playing cod2 or counterstrike source brings back fond memories(online friends,guilds etc).
As I grew older I feel like gaming became boring and porn and youtube gained in % a lot.
I did have a phase where I was trying to learn programming,animation,3D modeling and drawing.(4 years)
Over the years as I have choosen being home on the computer I have basically obliterated my chance of having friends,like real life friends that you hang out with,play games,talk with etc. and cuz of that I felt that removing this toxic thing aka stopping from being online was me getting rid of this one last thing that kept me happy/distracted from how goalless my life is.
I currently dont work as a programmer or 3D modeler but thats the only thing in life that ever drew me in but I feel like shutting down the computer,phone(my phone is basically a distraction for me at work when there is little work and I use it to read reddit and for gatcha games(gambling ones that I am caring less and less while I used to spend real money on them in the past)) and doing some excercise,meet some people and just shut off the online world.
I feel like that now,but tomorrow I'll probably be back at the ""safe place"" or when life challenges me in some way be it at work,awkward social situation...
I am about to have 28 years and my life is basically a whole lot of nothing and I dont think I have still accepted/learned to work for something for years to achieve it.
I used to work for 4 years and I had a low income and there was just one goal that I set and just with basic caluclations it wasnt achieavable.
I would have had to not spend any of the money for 4 years just to buy a crappy second hand car that would prob break in 5 years.
Cant even imagine how hard it would have been if I couldnt use the car of my mother.
Sry about a long post,it could have been longer if I added more details but this should suffice to depict the state of my mind.",Addiction
"So I don?t have an average addiction to social media, I have no problem staying off of my own socials, but I cannot stop checking up on people that used to be in my life.

"I saw my niece yesterday. She was supposed to come over for a visit at 11. I didn't see her, so I sent her a text saying are you still coming at 11. In return I got a phone call with my niece all stressed out saying, ""did I tell you I would do something for you?"" I said, ""no, you said you wanted to visit and would be here at 11."" I was just following up with her. During the call I noticed an elevated tone of voice, fast speaking but with this groggy sound to her voice. I told her it is no problem if you're not coming I just wanted to know. I also said, ""you sound completely wiped out why don't you get some rest and visit when you feel better?"" My niece said, ""No, I have to come on the island anyway.""I said, ""oh, are you still getting working down the south end of town?"" My niece said no, she wasn't working and offered no reason for coming on the island. This is relevant because I live on a barrier island where tourism is king and places aren't open now. There is nothing to come to this time of year.Honestly, it made no difference if she came over or not. Anyway, about three hours later I get a phone call. It is my niece and she' around the corner if I want to hangout. I say yes because I'm home and she gets here. She is loud shouting about how she loves my couch and chairs. She is overly animated about a used couch and a chair. She tells me she is not going to work anymore for the next six montys and is going on unemployment, but in the same sentence she tells me her unemployment is screwed up and had been for six months. My niece never did anything to secure unemployment payments. My niece has already opened a claim six months ago and never responded to their request for additional information and that is how things got screwed up. In her mind, she was wronged by the system. I talked to her carefully and told her, ""no, I don't think they tried to screw you. I think you had to call in and report that you had hours of work and no longer wanted unemployment. She is spacey and never did it and now is pulling this, ""whoa this is happening to me."" Now, to get to the gut wrenching part. While she was here I noticed the way she was talking, I could see she was moving really fast. At the same time we were sitting on the couch I actually saw my niece dose off to sleep. Now, I understand not getting a good night sleep, but this was different. My niece was dipping out just like I remember from before when she used. Another weird thing I shared with my nephew is how my niece kind of disappeared about six months ago. We used to hangout regularly and all of a sudden she didn't come on weekends and she stopped replying to texts and phone calls. This isn't normal behavior and when my nephew and I saw her we both agreed she was clearly using again.

I am afraid my niece was high on drugs (opiates) and the reasons why she was on the island was supposedly to give someone a ride to the market to get gerbil food. My niece would have driven more than an hour just to take her friend to get gerbil food. No fucking way - I call bullshit. I think my niece was on the island on the other end of town to score drugs. She stopped working and now she's saying she didn't get unemployment and whoaa is her what is she going to do.

I don't know what to do. I want to call my niece out and say ""you're high on pills,"" but last time I called her out she cursed me out, told me she wasn't high (a complete lie) followed up with horrible things being said about me and she would never talk to me again for accusing her. My niece did talk to me again when she needed something. And, I have no problem with her ups and downs about how she feels about me. The thing is I was accurate she was using drugs.

I can't help to think she came on this island to score drugs because she has old friends that were users. A few years ago I noticed the same pattern with her keeping in touch and hanging out with old ""friends"" she used to use with. I think the person she saw today is her supplier.

I was not cool with it but I just went along cuz I met something after so long I was so lonely and really wanted to see how he was.as the relationship grew he opened up and told me he has coke and stuff. I only had one rule and that was not to have it the country we were working in cuz it was a serious crime there. But he still continued to having it cuz he couldn?t stop it. I really didn?t want to give up on him cuz he is a good guys. It took about 2 years and he stoped finally. I even told him if he really wanted for him to fly back home have a party and come back cuz I didn?t want him to risk everything here. Anyway the good news is he stoped it. Cuz of Covid we are back home and all these drugs are freely available. It?s been a year since we came down and we only partied 3 times. I feel it?s not something we should be doing. He is in his late 30?s and am in my early 30?s. I feel it?s time to stop but I don?t think he wants too. The last party was a bit wild cuz we went to a place where our friend had other?s friends over and there was a hooker. I was high too am not trying to act like a saint. But I was not meant be there. There were 10 guys 2 hookers and me. My husbands friend was so pissed of at him for bribing me there.

He has used marijuana daily since college, and recently I?ve noticed a huge change in his personality. He?s very aggressive, accusatory and angry most the time. Very unlike him. Any time over the years in our relationship I?ve mentioned his heavy weed use, it turns into an argument. He uses all day, every day except at work. On weekends he vapes from the minute he wakes up until he goes to sleep, and on weekdays he uses from the minute he gets home until he goes to sleep.

He uses weed to comfort himself, to celebrate?just for everything. I once asked if maybe we could have one ?sober day? a week and it caused a huge argument. I?m constantly told that marijuana isn?t addictive and it can?t be abused, and I know that isn?t true.

"I currently don't take any mood stabilizers for my bipolar disorder and have struggled for a very long time with a drug addiction also. Somehow I was always able to fly under the radar with it at the workplace and still be high almost 100% of the time. Drug abuse inevitably always got to the point though where it didn't even matter anymore if I got high from it or not, I just needed it to function that day and to feel ""normal"". All the years of thinking I had it under control did finally hit the fan at my last job. I got fired for the first time in my life and my addiction was the reason. I've been constantly beating myself up over it every day that I've spent jobless ever since. I can't even get myself to look for another job anymore either because the shame runs so deep for me having to explain now in an interview why I got fired from my last job and that alone keeps me from moving forward with my life. I really want to be honest about it so they don't end up finding out anyways with a routine call to my last place of employment or something. It needed to happen though or I never would of quit using. I am clean now for 4 months so I'd put much emphasis on that part and hope the honesty and taking accountability for making bad choices would stand out to the interviewer way more than just them judging me and immediately placing me with the negative stigma drug addicts get stuck with instead. I'm starting to feel like I don't deserve a second chance at all now because even I see myself being a drug addict as worthless and flawed, though I'm clean and should be proud of it.

"So, I've been smoking weed since I was pretty young, I'd say 13-14. I Tried X once, did my fair share of psychedelics since i was 18ish, and I've never really been too much of a drinker other than the occasional wine or beer with acquaintances. I'm a few months from 20 now and I'm moving forward with my goals of working in the medical field. I'd like to go to medical school in a couple years actually but right now I'd like to start as an EMT/Paramedic and get hands-on experience i wouldn't really be able to get elsewhere prior to med school. I've wanted to go into the medical field for as long as I've been able to think about a profession but in my struggle with my mental health, I've more than adequately self sabotaged more than I'd care to admit and maybe even more than I know myself.

With that being said, classes start in January which means no more drugs for this guy. Not just for the sake of the job but for my own and the sake of the people whose wellbeing will be my responsibility. I haven't done psychedelics in a couple months and have done a good job with not touching them. I'd have to say I'm proud of myself on that note actually. However, I know kicking my best friend since i was a preteen will be a bit tricker for me. I'm thinking I'll smoke one last time with my friend before I say goodbye for good but as of tonight I have smoked my last bowl as far as on my own. My question is what advice does everyone have to keep myself from smoking and staying consistent over the next few months until classes start even after. I feel like once the semester starts It will be easier with all the classes and work keeping me on my feet on my mind off wanting to (or maybe the complete opposite.)

"With my honest assessment, I'd have to say that I became an entertainment, self-improvement information and video gaming addict. I say this with an intent to convey the fact that these things in themselves may not be addictions, but currently, I'm doing them way too much and I don't experience pleasure from doing/achieving the regular stuff or any desire/drive/motivation to go through the hard things in order to achieve something or to be of service.
Like... I know many things that I could do in order to improve my life and possibly others' too, but I simply can't force myself to do it quite often. A few months ago I've had a great drive to grind one video game, I've done it for a couple of months almost non stop. I felt great, I was excited, happy to do it and it was my goal. Now, I don't have even a few % of that drive and motivation to do the same thing. It became literally boring and... I don't know, dull maybe?

While I'm not depressed in the mood sense (Feeling sad), but I'm lacking any drive, ambition and desire to do anything meaningful (even though I intellectualy understand and know those things). It's just like I have to force myself constantly to do anything (except for watching Netflix, porn, eating very tasty food and playing video games --- switching these activities constantly because one of them could get boring pretty quickly).

My main point of the post is as follows: how do I create the reset? The doctors and scientists that I've referred to in the title have mentioned in their interview that abstaining from the activity could greatly help in resetting the dopamine (which in turns raises the pleasure levels of more normal/less stimulating things/activities and possibly raises the desire/motivation to do things).
Which behaviours would fall under stimulating activities and which not? I think of reading books, learning new skills, being socially active (hanging out with other people and getting to know new people). Which of those are actually the ones that would add to the problem?

I'm thinking of travelling to another city to my grandma's place for a month at least, spend time with her without brining my smartphone or computers (thus, I'd have no way of constantly sitting on them and doing those things). Also, I'm a bit of a food junkie, but I know of ways to prevent myself from doing those things (giving away my wallet and finances to grandma while I'm there).



In summary, I think of meditation, physical exercise of various ways, reading books, spending time with grandmother and conversating with her, eating regular food and drinking water/teas, going for walks by the sea and in the nature, maybe even riding a bicycle. Do any of these activities stimulate enough for the dopamine reset period to be less effective?",Addiction

Anyway i think they're gonna find out imminently and i cant bear it i feel so sick and so sorry, and Im stuck at home for the next few days in the same house but its my birthday, and I obviously don't want them spending more money on me but don't know if i should tell them or not before I leave because i feel like it would be worse to say whilst Im there? But i also don't want them to find out before I've told them and don't want to accept any presents. I really need help because i can't sleep or eat and i feel so sick like i can't bear to live with myself. I don't know what would be best to do, please help me. Obviously i will pay them back but it will take some time.",Addiction
So I just got back from rehab earlier in this month I?ve been doing good I guess. My drug of choice is heroin and meth.

"So my partner (m24) has a drug past and had lost control over parts of his life. Somehow he turned things around though, only the weed stayed in his life.

When we met 1.5 year ago he was off stuff other than weed and the week of our first date he took cocaine for the last time. He wasn?t doing it regularly anymore at that point but it was at a birthday party he went to.

By now we live together and as much as I don?t understand the weed-smoking, and as much as I think he should stop as no addition is healthy, no matter which what shit it helps you to deal, but ok. I try to tell myself that it?s not necessarily worse than e.g. drinking. And he does his stuff you know? he works, he takes care of things and himself and me

The last weeks he kept talking about the urge to do harder drugs again and I didn?t know what to say. I?ve never been in touch with drugs and I don?t understand it. I do understand addiction and I also see that it can seem like a ?good way out? when other things in life feel a bit off. I told him that I will not tell him what to do and what not. He is an adult and there is no need for me to control his life and actions

I was gone over the weekend and he just told me that a friend was over and they did some cocaine last night. And I freaked out. Not on him but internally. I?m not home yet, on my way for a few more hours, and I have to go somewhere with my emotions. I didn?t think I would be that surprised/worried/angry about it. And I don?t know how to face him and what to say when I get home as I didn?t even know what I feel right now.

He keeps saying it was a one time thing, he just wanted to feel this kind of high again and he had a long year and stayed clean. He won?t do it again, he just needed a night of letting off steam.

I want to believe him but I?m worried sick?",Addiction
"Someone close to me is addicted to their perscription medication. They are on an extreme amount of pills at VERY high dosages and we all do not know how they are still alive. It's been well over a year (or two?) and they are worse than ever.

They have hit their lowest point and finally agreed to get help, however we are at a loss on how to find it. Everywhere seems to want thousands of dollars for treatment and we don't have any money. They claim their doctor knows about their addiction (not sure I believe this). I was hoping someone here might know anything that could help. We live in Canada.

"He (24m) has had a severe problem with alcohol and coke in the past (tied into severely depressed, sometimes suicidal thinking) before we got together. I never actively did anything to change his behavior, but apparently, as a result of us being together, he completely quit intoxicants.

Fast forward a year to now: he/we have been through a lot, including two major moves across the country for him, one of them to avoid drug triggers. Now, he's trying to finish trade school alone (I couldnt go with him, at least at first) and he's started a major slide-- one that has him scared he's going to just go entirely back to his old behaviors. As far as I can tell, this is a result of a combination of loneliness/boredom (it's a very podunk town) and very bad influences (his classmates.)

As an immediate bandaid, I'm getting him out of there and home to his parents house for 2 weeks while we figure shit out. If he leaves school, he could potentially lose out on a lot of time and money and I don't think that would help his mental state at all either. Staying at school by myself and going to rehab or therapy isn't an option, because I can promise there are no good options where he is (unless we're talking online, but still.) The only solution I can think of that hopefully results in him finishing school without fully relapsing is relocating to be with him as his support system until he finishes school, then getting him back home again to get help.

Am I being totally delusional thinking I can help him alone, even in the short term? I did it before without even meaning to, so maybe I can do an even better job knowingly? Or am I just setting him up for an even harder fall? I just want to give him whatever would be the best help, short-and-long term.",Addiction

"My Partner has had pretty severe opiate addiction problems in the past. He is doing okay now but had relapsed a couple of times while we have been together and while he was on Methadone. He has done incredibly well so far, and has been able to microdose onto Suboxone. He also struggles with depression. In these states of depression, I worry that he may start using again. I feel wrong to automatically assume that if something is wrong with him, that very likely it is drugs. I don't want him to feel so down on himself and I don't know how to help. I also want to give him the benefit of the doubt, because I know it's hurts him to think that I am not trusting him. It is just hard to have trust when I have been hurt in the past by his addiction.

"So, my husband has been using hard drugs the past year following his relapse by not having Suboxone for a day or so. He's been using fentanyl, heroin, roxis, and now I found he's doing fentanyl again and ""girl"" which I think may be heroin.. idk. But I don't use at all. We have been married for almost 4 years. He's been on and off sober (longest was maybe a year and a half). But this last relapse it's been awful. I don't even like being around him anymore.Hes mean, he sleeps all day, nods out , doesn't help me with anything (we have two energetic huskies ). Granted sometimes he will help me take the dogs out but that's if he gets a shot in before. My car got repoed , my cards are maxed out and now Im being sued by my credit card. we are both on UE and he uses most of it for drugs.we go without alot. And half our stuff he's taken to the pawn shop. It makes me so unbelievably upset and im his only support... But how much can one take when you get manipulated everyday? When you can't put your foot down because you get threatened to get kicked out (even tho we live with his parents ) and I have no car to leave, no money to leave half the time and he says if I take the dogs then in stealing then.. and that I can't take my phone either because he pays for it (he hasn't paid for it in almost 3 months ) He spends over $100 a day. It breaks my heart and now we have a car accident settlement coming out and I fear if I don't get him into a place he will die, or I will have to leave him. He had agreed to go to rehab , I obtained health insurance for this purpose and now we have to wait till September 1st... Idk if I can wait that long. My bank account is just non existent. I feel stuck. He cries to me and tells me he hates this but then turns around and gets mad at me if I try to talk to him . what am I supposed to do?! At this point I hate who he has become... Sometimes I just leave the house and go sit in the woods to get away. I hate that he can access my stuff and makes me feel like shit because he will be sick if he doesn't get his ""medicine"" . I blame the Suboxone for this relapse.i do love him and been with him through the ups and downs but this is almost to the breaking point.

Update : The health insurance we couldn't pay in time.. and then he cries and tells me he's going to a rehab closer for free... But how do I know if he's actually going to this time and take it serious.",Addiction
So I've struggled with this idea that the medication that I'm on for sleeping that I'm abusing it. The dose that they gave me my doctor said to play around with it a little bit to see what makes me feel the most comfortable and I played with it a lot and found that it could make me feel really good but also have no memory and no control over my actions. So fast forward I decide this medication seems to be detrimental to my relationships since I texted a lot of people random things and they got scared for me and I was taking more and more of it. So I stopped and went off of it for like 6 months went back to the doctor and she turned in my old scripts including the one I'm abusing (I didn't know how to tell her that it's hard for me to take this medication) and so when I go to pick up my prescriptions it's in there of course. Had it in my house for probably like a week or two didn't take it but then one day when I was home alone I took a lot of it and went back on like a 3-day mania binge. I know if it had been an opiate I would have died. I took so much medication before My partner came home and kind of helped try to slow me down. It took me a few embarrassing days to come down and like reset. Now I'm really scared that this is going to keep happening over and over and cost me so many relationships. I can move on I know I can and cut it off cold turkey but when it's offered to me I don't know if I can say no at that point. And sometimes like the nightmares and insomnia and that I get this medication really helps with those nights when I can't sleep. And I'm currently really needing to take something because I can't sleep for more than and half and a half a time because of PTSD flashbacks and nightmares. I know I can't keep going forward and ignoring this obvious pattern.... But I don't even know what my next step is.... And I'm so horribly ashamed and sad and scared and so many of my friends are just keep texting like are you okay because they never seen me like that....,Addiction
"I?ve come to realize I need to have at least one addiction in my daily life. First, it was smoking when I was in college. Then I quit, but started drinking alcohol instead. I then went to see a psychiatrist to quit drinking and started taking Lexapro for anxiety. Now I?ve stopped taking Lexapro too, but am back to smoking.

I realized I crave a way to ?end the day? with something that?s supposed to be relaxing and stress-relieving, like alcohol, cigarettes or anti-depressants. I usually spend the whole day just feeling anxious about every little thing, then at night I would crave that stress-relief substance, whatever substance.

I?ve tried meditating, practice mindfulness, breathing exercises; I have so many hobbies like painting and interior design. None of that helps me satisfy the cravings, like they're not strong enough serotonin boosters. I don't want to be a slave to these destructive habits, and I don't want to keep fighting one addiction after another for my whole life. I've made an appointment to go back on Lexapro. Anti-depressants might not be the best solution, but I figured it's better than alcohol or nicotine.

Therapy is very expensive where I live; a one-hour session is more expensive than a month's worth of alcohol and nicotine. Maybe in the future I will see a therapist when I'm more financially capable, but for now, does anybody have any advice on ways to stop craving bad habits as a way to relief stress?",Addiction
"My father in law lost his wife a month ago. He?s a mean narcissistic person who was drinking on and off for years - but now he?s really into that stuff. He?s totally helpless without his wife but he despises even the idea of therapy and denies that he needs help with alcoholism and his chores. He is ?men are though? kind of guy. He tries to find meaning in life after the loss and that?s a good thing, but he fails as his narcissistic defenses make him unbearable for others. He had blood cancer, in remission. As he is an older guy and not with the best health, we, the family, are thinking what might help him. Among options, rehab therapy looks promising. But it?ll cost us a lot of money. Is rehab good for older people? Because we never had any experience with that. Will a long term rehab like 8+ months be helpful or is it a lost case? Are there different programs of rehab centers?

"Never thought I'd be in this situation, but thanks in advance to anyone that can lend some advise.

First of all, this takes place in Canada. I'm getting married this weekend and a month ago I myself happened to discover that my future wife's father has been injecting/smoking meth. My wife's family is a fairly well off one, that I would never have expected this to happen to, however I do understand that socioeconomic status does not always play a role in the life of an addict.

Since making this discovery I have brought together the siblings and the aunt and uncle so we can move as a team on this. Things with our plans were coming along well, until last night when I came across a lot of paraphernalia in the locked master bedroom while assessing a previous shower leak they had. They were out for the night, so my wife and I stopped in to feed the cats and I figured I'd assess while I was there. There were the following items present.

2 water bongs with crack/meth bowls on each 4 jet lighters 2 bags of meth clear and yellow 3 pipes 2 pairs of tweezers And a random assortment of empty bags

I'm very concerned that the mother might in fact be involved, but the strange thing is that the parents marriage has deteriorated significantly over the past 3 years, with the father disappearing sometimes for days on end. They are 60 years old.

Any opinions or suggestions on this matter would be greatly appreciated

" I am new to this subreddit and I just want to know if this it the right subreddit or if you recommend any other for me? Ive been in a relationship with my current boyfriend (28yo) for almost 3 years. The past 2 years have been extremely tough on me, between Covid-19, being in a foreign country and what I thought it was me the problem that was causing my bf to ignore me. It got to a point that I?ve been going to a psychiatrist and I am officially severely depressed and about to start taking medication. He has never been a social person or wants to go outside so much but it?s been getting worse, always calls me selfish or thinks I?m being selfish for inviting him to go to a bar with my friends or asking if we could go and watch a movie! Last week he freaked out about a trip we made that he didn?t want to go, but ended up going to ?make me happy? and just ruined the trip to me and his family and asked to leave a day earlier. He kept saying how selfish I was. He doesn?t want to commit to anything. He just wants to do his own thing which is laying down in bed, eat, sleep, repeat. Since I?ve met him he smokes weed and I had a problem with it in the beginning because it?s not common in my culture or very popular from were I am from. But eventually I got over it. After the trip, I was just afraid and a little bit of grossed out of his attitude and reaction towards everyone, so I had a conversation with him and told him that I was going to move out. Then it?s when he started to admit that he needs help that he is addicted to weed and he couldn?t see how much this affected my mental health and self esteem. I?ve been reading about people with weed addiction and sounds like I?m living with one (which I had no idea) I guess my question is, because he wants to improve and quit. What can I do to help and would it get better? Or should I just leave and make him deal with it on his own? I am terrified that whenever he craves weed I?ll be the one who gets the blame for.

Just to clarify: he was the one that told me he had a problem which I was super oblivious about. I never asked him to quit or conditioned him of me leaving if he doesn?t quit. He brought this up",Addiction

"I used heroin 10 years ago when I was 17. I wasn?t in too deep and I quit it on my own.

So over the course of the past couple of months, I?ve done something bad. Not that I?ve actually done the drug, but I?ve let myself ?fantasize? about it. At first just a little when I was bored or stressed. Then just like the drug itself I did it more and more and have triggered myself into a crazy addict state of mind.

I can?t hardly think about anything else. My brain is hatching schemes on how I could obtain the drugs. I?m wishing they would just fall into my lap somehow. I?m remembering what it was like to stare at my phone all day waiting for a drug dealer to text me back.

I don?t want to focus too much on the reasons why I ?need? Ritalin, but long story short I was diagnosed with ADHD, primarily inattentive disorder, and a general and social anxiety disorder. I put need in quotes because I know there are a lot of ways to help without using chemical help, but I?ve tried therapy and all I got from it was a few days of depression after opening up the scars and then doing it all over again.

i need urgent advice on how to help my brother with his addiction. since he left for college he hasnt been the same and is exhibitibg signs of schizoprhenia. i used to think it was just a mental problem but i know beleive its because of his drug use. he expeiriences delusions and thinks we are spying on him and i also see him talking to things that arent there when he is high. he is very paranoid and he is also stronger than me and my mom so its scary when he is having an episode or freaking out cause he thinks we stole millions of dollars from him. i recently confirmed his drug use when i saw him with a narcan device but ive never actually seen him doing any hard drugs. we have had to kick him out because he threatened our family multiple times and we dont know what to do. weve never confronted him about his drug use in fear that he might lash out and try to hurt one of us. please any advice would help. i live everyday on edge thinking hes going to come to the house and kill us. any ideas on what drugs he could be using?,Addiction
I'm worried that I'm becoming dependent on weed.. Its made me lazy and unmotivated and very disconnected with the world its made me feel depressed and completely numb with my emotions. Does anyone else have this experience. How do I get myself back ?,Addiction
So I have a problem. I want help. I?m tryin to do little drugs cuz I can?t quit altogether cuz I need help doing that. My son has been going through a lot including head trauma and coded 2 times as well as jail and courts. I want to be there for him. I also don?t want to just disappear cuz it would devastate both of my sons. My husband gets really pushy and aggressive with going away. He refers to me as a druggie and so on. Makes many accusations and says I?m delusional when I bring a problem between us I feel like I?m not heard at all no matter how I tell him. He also demands that I give up the name of the person I get stuff from. He wants to hurt them. I understand but that doesn?t help me Then I start to not trust him. He gets mad and think I?m choosing another man which I?m not at all. I want it to work and I want help. He pushes me away when his attitude of being mean that nice. So he tired again to force me to tell him. He said I chose him. I didn?t. No relationship there except one thing. He wants a divorce now. When I want to communicate better he won?t. When I ask questions he answers with a question and won?t answer my question. Everything i say and the way he interpreted it is what I said. It doesn?t matter how or how much I explain how I meant something. So o get angry. Then I?m loud and yelling. Then he tells me it?s cuz I?m on drugs.,Addiction
"This is serious to me. My father is addicted to alcohol. I've been trying to get him to stop and I've failed so far. Also, he can't help himself, he doesn't want to stop drinking it because he thinks drinking a bit of alcohol will give benefits to his heart or something. Is that true? Anyways he doesn't he drinkes at least 5-8 bottles of beer, a bunch of wine, etc. Plus, I'm 13 and I don't have many options.

"First off.. 22 days!! Never thought I'd (17m) make it this far and I'm quite proud of myself.

However, recently I started having doubts about all of it. I started wondering whether it was worth it to be doing all of this at such a young age since I really do want to experience a 'normal' life like other kids. I'm sure most kids my age are doing it all the time and aren't having issues with it. I was sort of curious on how I'd react to it after having abstained for such a long time. I thought the abstaining might have changed the way I react to masturbation. I haven't acted on these thoughts but I'd like some advice regarding them.

Also, recently the act of abstaining hasn't been the same as when I started. It's become more of an obligation and I'm just mindlessly avoiding it. I feel just about the same as when I was doing it all where my emotions barely surface. Only difference is I'm not feeling down all the time.",Addiction
"I don't have any addictions so I just can not understand. But here's the story. So my boyfriend has a sex/porn addiction and I personally absolutely hate porn. I'm not asking him to stop completely, because I understand it's a normal thing and I probably just have my own issues, I just want him to slow down. I'm constantly catching him looking while we're laying in bed together, on the couch, and walking by him. He doesn't jack off to it he just looks at it. We have sex minimum once a day and I always tell him I'll gladly please him in other ways any time, if I don't feel like having sex. He knows how much it hurts me. We've had multiple conversations about it. He says he's trying to control it. He says that he just kind of ""blacks out"" and doesn't think of the consequences when he looks. This makes absolutely no sense to me. I can't imagine doing something and just completely forgetting something that has been talked about over and over. This is a big thing to me and it could be a deal breaker if he can't ever figure it out. It really hurts me bad. I just can't understand why he doesn't want to look at me, feel me, when I'm right next to him. I just want to understand how addiction to something that isn't technically addicting, is a thing. I'd also take book or website recommendations to help me.",Addiction
"I have a question about a situation that blurs the line of addiction. My partner (female) drinks at least 3-4 drinks (and more) every day and has for the last few years. That is considered heavy drinking by the CDC and various medical sources, and is linked to various negative health outcomes. She sometimes drinks enough to throw up. We are mid-30's, not the age where you don't know your tolerance, however she is not a sloppy drunk on these puke nights to where it's obvious it was a mistake. She rationalizes it as a related anxiety adrenaline response that causes nausea unrelated to alcohol (e.g. ""the alcohol triggered my panic attack"").

The reason I'm asking for help is to figure out if I should say something or not. Most alcohol addiction/abuse sources mention treating alcohol as an addiction when it starts to interfere in work or relationships. My partner has begun to have what I call ""second order"" effects, such as depression, sleep issues, mental clarity issues, and physical changes (whereas first order effects are obvious intoxication, missing work, etc referred to in other sources as interfering with work or relationships). However, the link between second order effects and alcohol is not obvious -- i.e. she could be drinking to cope with another issue causing the depression and sleeplessness (a la self-medication). My partner has also recently shown other addictive tendencies within the past 5 years (obesity and online shopping).

She has had alcohol abuse and cancer in her family history, which is part of the reason I worry about her classification as a heavy drinker in what appears to be a new normal and not a phase to deal with short-term stress.

So, my question to the sub is: am I right to worry about long-term effects and should I gently intervene? Or is it none of my business until she shows classic ""first order"" effects of alcohol interfering with life? Are there good sources for how to intervene in a preemptive health way, rather than the typical advice for how to intervene with a sloppy-drunk-obviously-alcoholic person?",Addiction
"I'm not good at typing or articulating myself so bare with me. I'll keep it simply . Week before my 21 birthday we lost my father in my childhood home on hospice.

It took just a couple days' worth to get me hooked on it. After that I began feeling what I call ""casual cravings"" for porn. I say casual as I do not feel the horniness but I still want to do it?

At this point I barely ever think about porn which feels amazing.

I've made myself busy everyday and have plans to do many fun things after a small epiphany I had a couple days ago. This left me feeling super hopeful and motivated (almost reaching the levels of motivation that I used to have). However, I've started to notice myself trying to do too many things and just hopping between activities. This is causing the days to become a sort of blur. I am also slowly losing the motivation in correlation. It may be due to my unusual sleeping habits (which I will fix by tomorrow) but I'm looking for any other ideas as to where I may improve.

I watch what I eat and I try to keep my calories down, but I like to eat ice cream. I told my partner, that if they loved me then they won?t buy ice cream and bring it into the house.

I don?t eat ice cream everyday, but I eat it atleast 3-4 days a week. I?ve noticed that I will rationalize eating ice cream, if I can only have 1000 calories or less then I will be telling myself, that if I eat an ice cream for dinner then I can?t eat anything else because I hit my caloric limit.

I also notice, when I eat ice cream, I also gain weight. So I really need help to quit eating it as much if not all together.",Addiction

"My best friend has been addicted to drugs for about a year now. It got pretty severe after they suffered a really traumatic experience that almost killed them. We did various hard drugs to ""cope"" with the trauma, and it got so out of hand. I hated the way I was, it constantly left me in a dangerous state of mind and doing xanax made me forget more than half the things that happened. When they made their first attempt to get professional help, I promised myself and them that I would never do hard drugs again, especially while I'm with them (and I haven't) because I didn't want to be in a situation like that ever again and even though I knew they would've done it anyways, I didn't want to contribute to their addiction. They've been struggling with it ever since. Addiction is definitely and sadly something I've always grown up around and seen. My parent overdosed. My other abusive parent was addicted to hard drugs and is still an alcoholic as well as most of my family. And just last week, I lost one of my closest friends to an overdose, and I'm still mourning the death. Addiction is not a choice, i understand that. I struggle with my own addictions, but I'll ever understand not having the option to just quit an addiction that causes excruciating pain and some cases death or having to cope with an addiction for the rest of my life. I feel really selfish for even feeling this way, but its really hard to keep my feelings to myself and also try to be there for my friend. I'm scared every day that I'm going to lose them, that I will say something that will make things worse, or they will get really hurt by what I say. It hurt so much to sneak them drugs before I left the hospital, see them go to the funeral high and make jokes about drug overdose after my friend passed away, comotose on the couch when friends are over, and to be in dangerous and uncomfortable situations or have my feelings compromised for their comfort. Ive told them how I felt before, but I think it just made things worse. I know they can't help it and they're taking on such a burden of trying to get clean without any help and suffering from cptsd. I want to be here for them, the last thing I want to do is make them feel like a bad person, but I can't if I'm being put in these kinds of situations.

Sometimes I would do it 3 or 4 times a day for that feeling. It has been something that I have been ashamed of and really want to quit. Along with pornography it had ruined some friendships of mine because of the way i looked at my female friends. I looked at them as more of sexual objects and not really as friends.

I've often worried about being a boring person and how I've put up walls around myself and today I think I've found the issue. Whenever I had had anxiety attacks that were bad I always tried to distance myself from it and could always 'feel' my emotions retreating deep within me. It was as if I shoved them into a jail cell and locked them up. I know understand how disruptive that was especially as a growing and maturing child.

I think I used porn as a medium to feel something as I delusionally thought it might rekindle my emotions. The 'rush' of watching it was likely mistaken for real emotions and that's what drew me to do it so often. I will be working on this asap.

"Rough day. Not gonna get into details but for some reason ended up with a MAJOR craving. Just did a big art painting commission so I have ""secret money""(I refuse to pay tax on art sales even over $1000) Long story short: My girlfriend, a churchgoing Christian fell asleep early so I went for a ride.

Rather, I need a sort of ""buffer activity"" in which I will always refer to when I have nothing on my plate. This way my mind will be somewhat engaged however, also open enough to think of other things to do. I'm thinking of doing meditation but am open to any others too. Any recommendations?

Unfortunately, my need to constantly be doing 'something' has lead to me using my phone quite a bit. I recently discovered something about myself. I am afraid (for lack of a better word) of being bored. Though I've noticed that through just relaxing and being bored, I've always come up with something to do; I seem to be afraid to allow myself to just be bored. The buffer I go to is using my phone.

I think the root cause of the possible relapse was using my phone too much. Someone mentioned it too but I thought I had it under control. I am feeling very grateful that I didn't cave in. However, I recognize the unhealthy patterns which have lead me to this outcome. As my phone is already at a low battery right now I will simply allow it to finish and make sure to not touch it for a whole day.

"I got so much more than usual done today it almost feels like a distant memory. Usually my typical day consists of doing (maybe) one productive thing and I ride off those waves for the rest of the day. Today however it felt much easier to bring myself to do things. I woke up and just felt like doing some gardening and... I just did it.

I also went for a quick jog in the park and worked out with my skipping rope. I am sore all over and I know waking up tomorrow is going to be a chore itself????. Though I do feel better about myself for putting in the effort to develop a healthier lifestyle.

However, the lack of consumption is starting to have its effects. My now less than usual levels of serotonin are making me feel more emotional and there are some elements of old feelings and personality fragments being brought up.

I am slowly beginning to realise the self destructive patterns I had put in motion for myself which is important and needs to be addressed. That's all for the day and thanks for being here!

"I'm here because my wife has admitted to an addiction of drinking. There's a lot to it and I want to be succinct. This has come out over time (together 10 yrs), and I unwittingly contributed to it. I feel horrible about that, and didn't fully understand what was going on. While she isn't a full blown alcoholic in the sense that this is veering out of some semblance of control, there have been serious problems recently that have put the spotlight on this. I'm unable to conceptualize addiction or how to properly help. I personally hate the feeling of not having control on a personal level, and keep my alcohol consumption in check rather easily. My wife has also admitted, and I have realized, that she becomes a completely different person that is merely a mimic of her sober self when she drinks.

Important points:

We are health oriented in general (clean diet, regular fitness, etc).

Wine is the vice, but there's no such thing as ""just one drink"" if there is an option for more (for her).

We both went dry in prep for a race that lasted 2 months, and it was great. Since then we have trickled back into occasional (and very limited) drinking; for reference we will share 1 bottle of wine, or have up to 2 drinks on a planned outing, with multiple dry days in between.

No alcohol just sitting on the shelf in our home.



In the interest of healthy support, I am looking for ways that I can contribute to, and maintain a positive space for my wife to overcome this challenge. I need to better understand the mindset of an addict without prying (my wife gets very defensive if I pointedly bring certain things up). I feel like this is manageable without external intervention beyond myself. I want to do this without explicitly highlighting her addiction in the negative connotations that seems to be the norm. Any resources or advice with this approach would be of great help.",Addiction

"17m. Recently I began using a chat site to actively seek partners to engage in online sexual activities such as sexting etc. I made the decision today to quit for good and I am going to redirect my energy into more productive things like developing hobbies and finding and maintaining multiple interests.

"It all began when someone gave me a PC during quarantine. And then of course the first thing that comes in mind was video games. So i installed video games and other stuff. And then one time my dad thought that I should minimize using the PC, but I didn't listen. And then I coudn't control myself and started playing videogames almost all of the time. Which results to lack of responsibilities and bad time management. And so began my dad being mad at me for things that I should have done. And started implementing rules, but of course I disobeyed and played whenever no one was around. But that came to an end when I was busted multiple times, which led to my father being mad at me so hard that it made my heart break. And now i think I should come clean and start changing for my own good and for my family. Thank you for the person who took time in reading this, hope you have a nice day.",Addiction

I think I'm dealing with an addiction. Would like to talk to someone about it. It a sexual addiction well I guess it's masturbation addiction. Was curious if other men masturbate multiple times a day?,Addiction
"20M I was introduced to masturbation when I was 5-6 by my neighborhood he hella gay , but I don't think he molested me or something. He was atleast 16 at that time. Yeah I think he jerked me off, I vaguely remember that time. My mind completely shut off that period until I was 17 years old then I realized, 'holy shit I was abused as a child' I kept it a secret from everyone.

From then on like after I became 8-9 I became gradually addicted to masturbation. it was scarce or occasional at first. But later both my parents work full time. And I was alone hence I got into this habit hard.

Fast forward as a 21yo -> I got this memory problem , addiction, social awkwardness , muscle weakness ,being depressed all the time, lazy, fucked by acne due to harmonal imbalances and some other problems.",Addiction
"So Im about 2 years sober and clean. Im 27(F) i have three children ages 10,8 and 5. I was in a miserable 10 years marriage. Got out of the and my current husband (also an addict and best friend of 15 years) got clean together. were doing great.Life is wonderful and peaceful and im so happy and healthy.

But i have this guilt,i dont remember my childrens lives like other people do. i have to see the pictures. And that hurts my heart, While they,ve always,ALWAYS been taken care of. i was just so out of it all the time. i was pregnant and breastfeeding for 7 years back to back.i never used during that time. but when the baby stopped nursing i was right back at it. I have a highly addictive personality,i can get hooked on anything pretty much instantly. anyway, im trailing off.

I'm not sure I'm putting this in the right spot and I'm not gonna be meticulous about my grammar. I am totally on the verge of completely losing my shit and I just need some advice. So here's the deal. I'm 36. My boyfriend is 34. We have been together for almost two years. We have always partied pretty hard together and always had good communication about what we were doing and who we were doing it with but then for some fucking reason my boyfriend decides he is gonna try crack and his behavior got shady and it became a regular thing and we fought about it but he kept saying he was done blah blah but he wasn't. Instead of stopping crack he decides he is gonna try shooting up cocaine and his behaviors got even shadier and all of a sudden he likes to dissapear for days on end and says he is in a hotel room to get away from my negative energy...aka to shoot up in peace. He says he is alone while he is there....but this last time around he came back with some anal toys I know for a fact he didn't leave with....um I guess my question is is it normal behavior for men shooting up coke to shove things in there ass all alone in a hotel room?,Addiction
"So I?ve been in therapy short-term twice now and I haven?t been able to touch on this subject much with the doctors I was seeing. I?m in search of another Doctor currently to help sort out the effects of abuse that I?ve dealt with at the hands of my mother. I?m not sure how long it will take to see someone, but this has been heavy on my mind..

I am 28 years old. My mom is 58 years old. And ever since I could remember she has been an addict. One of my first memories was her screaming at me for waking her up on our couch in the middle of the day, I was about 3 at this time. The rest of my childhood would continue the same, along with much verbal and emotional abuse by her. Sexual abuse at age 10-12 by my older cousin who had lived with us, which much later I learned had been providing drugs to my mom in exchange for living in our home.

Soo, I?m struggling A LOT with resentment towards her. My dad has never said anything to my sister and I about the drug use or how it?s affected him, my mom, or us. My mom is in denial mode most of the time, so it?s hard to talk to her about anything of substance.

She has recently been in and out of the hospital, juggling a number of health issues all at once. I?ve been having to care for her a lot and visit my childhood home, which is pretty triggering for me to even be there. All these feelings kind of intertwined and it just feels like a roller coaster.

I?m wondering if anyone has gone through anything similar and how you handled it. I?m at a point where I want to tell her about how I know about her addiction and be supportive, while also telling her how it?s impacted my life. Thank you in advance. I know this is kind of a tricky inquiry.",Addiction

"Words of encouragement to those who battle addiction head on like a warrior. I proudly and openly talk about my past and don't mind sharing my own experiences with anybody who listens. I refuse to let my scars define my entire life or define who I am. We all deserve the love and support without feeling ashamed or beaten down for mistakes that so many of us think we have to wear the reputation of being a drug addict and seem to be labeled to society through an entire life time and recovery is all we think about. Its okay to educate, talk and spread awareness but don't be at to rediscover yourself and create your own self. You have gone through it all and you have fought to create an entire life for yourself.

Yes an addict is seen ad viewed for the things they do amd the reputathon can be hard to get past for us all. Don't forget to not hold onto the guilt and punish yourself for bad choices you hace made. We are humans, we were destined to make mistakes, feel unworthy or even like we deserve being viewed as lesser people to society.

I know for fact that most of us have suffered through rejection and definitely haven't won a popularity contest in this world. The pressure can be hard on us to be normal or liked...we are brave, compassionate, misunderstood and sensitive about our feel.

You can become an entire different person - don't carry any label but you can love and embrace the new person you've become. You re worthy and its up to addicts to support one another.",Addiction

What triggers me, and he doesn't understand, is that hearing a Bic strike or him thinking he can just walking and say"" hey babe me and blah blah are going in the room .

"My boyfriend is quite a bit older than me, he?s been an addict/alcoholic his entire adult life. I met him when he was sober and I fell head over heels. But timing wasn?t on our side and he moved away, relapsed and came home for rehab. We got back together and he told me wasn?t using drugs(besides pot) and was seeing a drug and alcohol counselor who said it was okay for him to drink as long as it was within moderation and damage control. Fast forward 6 months, he lives with my sister and I and he left his journal open on the kitchen counter and my sister saw an entry that said he?s been doing meth a lot lately. She told me and I asked him about it and he said he was referring to the ephedrine he takes for work outs, apparently has the same effect as meth. Two weeks after that, I went to pick him up from work(he?s a bartender) and he was hammered at work. I gave him some attitude and he lost his mind. Yelled at me so harshly and loudly in front of his customers, said horrible things about me and how he only stays with me because I?m a good lay. It was an anger I?ve never seen from him before, it was alarming. The next day he tried to blame it on me for being a cunt while he was at work... but also said he would quit his job after I had to reiterate that he is a father and he can?t keep doing this and blah blah. And after the incident at his work, my older sister (who we live with), sat me down and told me about a lot of the strange behavior she?s been noticing about him(barely sleeps, erratic sometimes, can?t hardly sit still, small pupils or glossy eyes). I believe in forgiveness and that people can change, so I gave him a chance after our fight. But now he refuses to talk about what happened, even though it was only like a week and a half ago. And deflects on to me, doesn?t want to do a drug test. And this morning I did something that my god I wish I didn?t. I looked at his phone and a couple weeks ago he asked his buddy for krank and a 30 bag of something.... I am so lost",Addiction

My little cousin (we'll call him Oliver) is addicted to video games and has been for years. I believe he uses them as an escape because of his traumatic childhood and overall very, very hard life. Our family has a history of addiction and both of Oliver's parents were heroin addicts. His grandmother and her husband are essentially his parents. His mother left his life when he was 2, but she was never really in his life to begin with due to her addiction. His father died 2 years ago of an overdose after being 6 months clean and finally re-entering Oliver's life. He and his father were finally getting to be son and father when he passed away and it was very traumatic for the whole family, particularly Oliver's grandmother who is also his caretaker.",Addiction
"My boyfriend has struggled with addiction issues throughout his entire adult life. It started with pills after a surgery and progressed to anything and everything he could get his hands on. His last drug of choice was meth. I met him after he was sober for a year and he moved away, relapsed, came home for rehab and we got back together. He works in a bar and also is an alcoholic, he comes home from work drunk far too often. I notice, always, but sometimes don?t say anything. Last week I picked him up from work and he was hammered and blew up on me for calling him out. He was so angry, an anger I?ve never seen from him before. It was concerning. He verbally assaulted me in front of all of his customers and the entire ride home. He said the most horrible things to me. He hardly remembered it the next day and claims I set him off because I was being an ass at his place of work. Yet claims he was only drunk and swore he would quit his job because it?s not healthy for him. Now he is pussyfooting around quitting and I?ve realized he hardly sleeps. He blames it on the ephedrine he takes for his work outs, but he also has been asking me for Sudafed lately and he doesn?t believe in taking medications because he is an old school hippie.

"My father has been battling cancer for 10 years on and off. During that time he was prescribed oxycodone and also developed an alcohol problem when the pills stopped being as effective. He has finally admitted that he has a problem and needs help - a huge first step that we are all happy about. I am looking for some advice on the best course of action.

Since he has two main addictions (alcohol and oxy) the fear of my family is that a treatment center will make him immediately stop both and my mom is convinced it will, ?literally kill him.? I understand her concerns as he is still very weak and frail from cancer treatments. She thinks that the best would be a place that uses medication on an outpatient basis to treat the pill addiction first but he can continue to drink. I told her I don?t think you are technically supposed to drink on any addiction medication. Is there a way to safely and effectively treat multiple addictions this way or will he have to go cold turkey on the drinking while dealing with the pills first? I?m also afraid that he will just become addicted to the suboxone or whatever they give him to curb the other habits.

For some context: he is an extremely hard nut to crack. He tried for many years to quit smoking with everything from gum and patches to hypnotherapy to counseling and nothing worked. He is very hardheaded and stubborn and that is why we are impressed that he finally admitted his problems and chose to seek help.

"My partner has a severe coke addiction that has been going on for well over a decade. He is a DJ and heavily into rave scene etc so complete sobriety is not something he?s ready for but he?s been doing some really good work recently separating alcohol and drug use and cutting down. Somehow this is just making the losses seem even worse, especially since recently he doesn?t even seem to enjoy the high how he used to and it puts him into instant pain and depression. I feel selfish saying it but I?m getting so emotionally fatigued seeing him go through this and supporting him, stopping him harming himself, and watching over him waiting for his heart to give out or something. Some nights he just seems to go back into a more selfish and aggressive mindset and it?s getting so hard not to take it personally. I don?t know how to keep myself going through these nights, especially when they happen back to back for days at a time. He can?t access most services because he works away mon-fri with no regular hours so can?t even book in phone appointments and I am just at a loss as to how we can break this cycle. I guess I?m just asking for advice from anyone who understands his side / has supported someone through a similar situation, both to help me get through these nights with him and also how I can help him warm up to the idea of sobriety if people think that is the right path for him ultimately? I don?t know whether it?s realistic to aim for more controlled use or if he is just putting off the idea of going sober.

"Let me begin this by saying- this is not meant to judge anyone. To say anyone is wrong. Or to put anyone down based on their choices and their reasons for doing things. I truly mean that. Simply to put something that's been on my heart out there hoping it may touch someone. Cuz if it does, a life may be saved. To anyone who is looking at going into rehab, not because you really want to get clean, but simply as a way to get your parents, the courts, or whoever off of your back- please take the ones who truly are trying to get better into consideration. Because as any adict knows- when your ready to ask for help, there is a very good chance your lucky your still alive, and feel that if you don't get help soon, your going to die. A lot of people don't know how frustrating the process for someone on their own to get themselves into a rehab can be. Now I think it should take work. This is the first step back to being the responsible adult you lost sight of due to your addiction. And being an adult requires work. But calling morning noon and night praying everytime you ask ""do you have a bed"" the Answer will finally today be yes. And crushed each time it's not. You start out strong. ""I can do this. I'm stronger than this. I'm better than this. I'm worth fighting for."" Are all things you tell yourself. But with each passing day, and the withdrawals kicking in more and more. Along with the mental part of withdrawals. Which can honestly be worse than the physical- your feeling good enough and worthy fade back to where you were in that addiction. You begin to start feeling like "" what was I thinking? I'm not worth them giving me a chance to get clean. I'm not strong enough to fight this. I can't do this. I'm wasting mine and those trying to help mes time. Cuz I'm too far gone. And so often after days and days of calling praying someone has a bed for you, people simply give up. And it's heartbreaking. And so often those beds aren't open because people are trying to fake good long enough to get back into someone's good graces, with no intention from the beginning to actually get clean and stay clean. Now I know sometimes something sparks inside the ones who go in doing just that, and they do get and stay clean. And that's amazing. What I'm getting at, if you don't plan on taking it serious. And appreciating the new lease on life your being given the opportunity to have- please, I'm begging you- don't take up a spot that someone truly needs and is praying for. Please.",Addiction

He has two kids from a previous relationship which we?ve been raising together full time for the last 5 years (they are 13 and 14) when he started using again, I tried to be supportive but it was hard and he would leav e for days at a time and then come back and act normal and it was just bad... finally he broke up with me. He said he was no good for me etc. blah blah then I found out he thought I was cheating on him (a friend of his said they thought they saw me with a guy and I have no clue what they could have even been talking about) I think that was him projecting cuz he was probably cheating on me, or just being paranoid which he had became.

Ok my point is this. I know I enabled him for quite a few years I realize this now I was trying to be supportive but it ended up enabling him to continue drug use. I?ve been the one raising his kids, working, paying bills, being responsible. Now he broke up with me and left the house and I?m still here taking care of his kids. Not sure what to do because I don?t want to continue to enable him yet I love his kids very much and they would have nowhere to stay if it weren?t for me. He texts them almost every day but hardly sees them and we are still in contact even though he ignored me and his kids for like 2 weeks after the breakup. I still love him and want him back but I know he needs to get better, get sober something needs to change. And I am only helping him continue being an addict with ease as I help him with his kids and continue communicating with him... It feels like there?s no good answer and I feel broken and stuck and sad.",Addiction
"My name is Robert, and I am an alcoholic. Furthermore, I am a person who is recovered from countless addictions and behavioral challenges. I was like so many individuals who were lost and afraid that nothing would ever change. I remember feeling so isolated and alone as a child. I was so confused and scared that I would get lost in my tears. I remember lying in bed at night when I was five and six years old and wondering why it hurts so much being me.

As I grew older, the pain deepened. When your pain goes to the degree that my pain did, it sets up an interesting dynamic. We learn at an early age that we are just not comfortable in our skin. From the earliest of memories, I remember I wanted to be somebody else, doing something else, be somewhere else. I did not feel comfortable in my skin. I was never satisfied.

My family dynamic was that of an alcoholic father, a codependent mom, and I was the middle child of seven children. We grew up in a home that was always upside down, and trying to find my balance was impossible. I became the chameleon. I never knew what someone else wanted or how I could become what I had to become for others to accept me.

Maybe you can relate to these feelings that I had. By the time I was a teenager things became much worse. As a child, little is expected of you. As we grow, so do the expectations that others have for us. This was not only true in my family, my social circles, and even academically. Because I did not feel that I had value I did not believe I could produce anything of value. The hole gets deeper and deeper and deeper.

We end up in what I have heard termed ?the hole of no hope.? When I was 14 years old, I took my first drink because I could get away with it. I remember how it made me feel once the alcohol hit my system. I went from being nothing to almost. When you come from nothing, are convinced you are always going to be nothing, being an almost is the top of the world. Every subsequent drink I took was an attempt to recapture that feeling of being an almost.

When one is convinced they will never amount to anything, being an almost is everything. In the beginning, it seems harmless enough and the frequency was based on the amount of emotional pain that I was feeling. I found as I got older, and my social circle grew, and my family and educational expectations grew, my anxiety of not measuring up grew as well. As I was constantly being reminded, the feeling that I was nothing grew, and so my need to be an almost grew proportionately.

Since I could not become almost on my own, I had to find the opportunity and the alcohol to be fulfilled. This is where the cycle became dangerous. My reliance was not on me feeling good about who I was. It was based on a substance that I found myself increasingly needing in frequency and amount.

When I turned 16 years old, I realized my drinking was getting out of control and had become obvious to others. It became necessary for me to experiment with other substances that would enhance my sensation that alcohol alone could no longer produce. In the beginning, a joint here and a joint there was sufficient, but that would make me tired and lethargic, and I was not left with a very adequate means to concentrate in school.

Someone introduced me to methamphetamines, and this helped keep me up and active during the day. Now instead of just drinking, I was smoking marijuana and eating amphetamines. The challenge with that was not eating, and I found it increasingly more difficult to sleep. That is when I began to introduce barbiturates into the rotation. Barbiturates were a very curious drug; that they did what alcohol was doing, but did it without the hangover. This went on and on until I got to my senior year in high school and on my 18th birthday, I decided to drop out of school.

It was January 3rd, and I would graduate that May. Nevertheless, my drinking and using career was needing my attention. I found it more important and more necessary to drink and use than what I thought a high school education could bring me. As the years passed and my struggles became greater, there was not a relationship or an opportunity that I was not willing to set aside to drink and use.

By the time I was 27 years old, I had become chronic in my addiction. I had added compulsive gambling, overeating, pornography, and I started throwing up three to five times per day. I was at the end of my rope and I knew that if something did not change, I was going to die. I knew there were no more chances for me.

On February 9th of 1986, I entered treatment and admitted I was an alcoholic. I was introduced to Alcoholics Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, and other 12 step groups. I began my pursuit of recovery. I began going to meetings and meeting new people. I was enjoying what I was finding in the rooms of recovery. Nevertheless, I found it so difficult in being honest with others.

I was sincerely afraid that you would find out that I was nothing. I knew that if I spoke too much or became too honest, you would figure that out and I would be the first person in the history of a 12-step program that you would ask not to come back. I know that sounds laughable to some, but it was a real fear for me.

Once again, I knew that something had to change, or I was going to die. I knew honesty was the best path for me, yet being honest was almost as fearful as the death that was waiting for me. Sadly, that led to my relapse after 71 days of being sober.

Fortunately for me, I only found it necessary to drink for five days. I was trying to recapture that feeling of being an almost. At the end of those five days, I realized that the only place for me was back in the rooms of recovery. On April 25th of 1986, I walked back into the rooms of Alcoholics Anonymous and I have never left.

That means that as of April 25th of 2021, I am celebrating 35 years of personal recovery. Even more astounding than 35 years is that it translates into 12,784 consecutive days of saying yes to life and no to my addiction. The journey has been remarkable.

There have been some challenges along the way, but then again, life is filled with challenges. I will never forget what it was like being a newcomer. It was the most frightening thing that I had ever experienced and yet I could not leave because I knew that I would die.

I realized that the only way for me to stay clean and sober and to become happy, joyous, and free was to apply the plan of recovery to the best of my ability. I made it my passion to go to meetings, get and work with my sponsor and become acclimated to a power greater than myself. As I did those things and began incorporating the 12 steps into my personal life things began to change in ways that I could have only dreamed of.

I went from being a nothing and an occasional almost to somebody who had more hope than anyone I had ever met. I began to resemble the people that I had met in the rooms of recovery. I began living and sharing some of the stories that I had heard them share with me.

When I would hear them share those stories my heart began to dance and sing, and I wished that those things would happen to me. They have happened to me and so many more. I cannot imagine a life that does not include one day at a time (ODAAT) and living a plan of recovery. I can honestly tell you for nearly all my 35 years of personal recovery, I wake up every day with a sense of gratitude and peace in anticipation because of what I have been so freely given.

I meet many people who are struggling the way I had struggled. I speak with many individuals who are trying to find the magic that would take them from dying a lonely death to a life of personal fulfillment and that surpasses all understanding. This is what I have found in my recovery journey. I was so fortunate that I met so many amazing people along the way.

Every person of significance to me, (outside of one who died during a relapse) is either clean and sober today or has passed away in sobriety. When I mentioned these individuals, I am talking about people who are sober 37, 39, 41, and 44 years. My sponsor Jack passed away two years ago with 44 years of personal recovery. Individuals like Texas Mike, Pete the Greek, Russian Ted, and Doc Irv all passed away as recovered members of the 12 Step Program.

One of the most exciting things about the plan of recovery that I followed is that it is a complete blueprint. When followed, the likelihood of having all the things it promises is all but guaranteed. I don't mean to say that everyone who starts the program of Alcoholics Anonymous finishes or lives a sober life.

What I am saying is I have never known anyone to relapse when they followed the path. After my relapse back in 1986, I was face to face with how dangerous I was to myself. The prospect of another relapse scared me more than I had ever been scared. I asked my sponsor what I needed to do to never relapse again. The answer was simple. The answer is service.

When I decided to incorporate the plan of recovery into my life for the express purpose of becoming more equipped to help others it completely revolutionized my thinking. I was no longer about me. It was about ?we.? Developing this way of thinking was transformational for me.

A section in the Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous talks about selfishness and self-centeredness being foundational to every problem I had ever had. Setting aside my ego is the best thing I could ever do.

Growing in sobriety has been the greatest journey one will ever take. That is exactly what recovery is. Recovery is a journey; it is not a destination. I am so glad that there is a finish line other than death.

My goal is to accomplish what my sponsor Jack Fisher accomplished. Jack sadly succumbed to cancer a little more than two years ago. At the time of his death, Jack had 44 years of continuous sobriety. As I chatted with him in his hospital room and knowing it would be the last time I was to see him alive, I asked him ?Jack, what do I tell them? What is your message you want me to share with others?? Jack looked at me with his cancer sunken eyes and said ?Bob, tell them it works.?

That simple phrase has resonated with me in different ways. The most important way it resonated with me is that it underscored the simplicity of what we're doing. There is no magic. There is no wondering if or how or when. The program of recovery works when you work it.

My message to you - and I want you to hear this loud and clear - is it works. I see so often people in social media bashing one recovery program or another.

Here's the deal, they all work. When you look at some of the programs within the monotheistic religions of the world and other secular programs, they work. There are far too many people who have been successful to suggest that they don't work. The common denominator of anything less than success is not the program, it is the person applying the program.

The opening paragraph in Chapter 5 of the Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous reads ?rarely have we seen a person fail who has thoroughly followed our path. Those who do not recover are people who cannot or will not completely give themselves to this simple program.? End of the story. I am fully convinced that when we apply the 12 steps of Alcoholics Anonymous and the plan as laid out in the first 164 pages of recovery, our result will be permanent sobriety.

I also believe this to be true with the Muslim Faith, Judaism, LDS Recovery, Celebrate Recovery, the Buddhist Network, and the list goes on and on. If you are involved in any of these programs or find a program where it has been demonstrated that it has worked for countless others, then guess what, if it doesn't work it is you. Why not humble ourselves?

Why not be as honest as only a dying person can be honest? I love the simplicity of the program as it states all we need to be is honest, open-minded, and willing. If we are these three things daily, there is never any reason for us to go back out again. So many people go out and never come back.

I count myself so fortunate to be a person who relapsed, found the doors of recovery still open, and gave it another go. As I wrap up this message to you today, I want you to know how grateful I am to have been given the gift of recovery. When I consider myself to have been clean and sober for 3 1/2 decades I am beyond grateful. What is even more astounding is that today is day 12,784 consecutive days of saying yes to life and no to death.

The areas in my life that I have been given are beyond, but I believe I deserve it. I have a marriage of 32 years. My children that I abandoned at the height of my addiction have forgiven me and we have a loving and working relationship that is in a continual process of heightened healing.

I don't regret who I am. Matter of fact, I celebrate who I am. I am no longer a person who came from nothing and would remain a nothing. My goal is no longer to be almost. Today I am somebody filled with hope, potential, and a satisfying heart of helping others achieve what I have been able to achieve.

I hope you are one that I can pass this mantle onto as you are beginning or continuing your journey of recovery. I have been blessed, fortunate, and honored to go from broken to whole. I desire to teach and guide others to find their way.

There will come a time that I am as Jack was. I will be laying in a hospital bed getting close to my last breath and someone that I love and who loves me will ask me what my message is that they can pass on. My message to them will simply be ?it works.?",Addiction

"For the past few months I?ve been watching my mom slowly unwind. It all started a few months ago when she started smoking cigarettes. She had been clean for four years and had just started up again after visiting her sisters in Georgia. My dad doesn?t like that she started smoking again because they quit together. She acts like she never quit. She is back up to almost two packs a day. I asked her why she started up again and she broke down and told me she was addicted to her pain medication. (She?s been taking pain meds over the past for years due to surgeries and neck/back problems and it?s never been like this.) She told me she?s overdosed on multiple occasions, falling asleep driving, and almost to the point where she didn?t think she would wake up some days. She ends up being out a week before her prescription is due. 15 extra pills she takes that she?s not supposed to. She?s only supposed to be taking them for pain when needed. She takes them multiple times a day and mixes them with her muscle relaxers that?s she?s only supposed to take as needed. The first thing she does in the morning is get up to look for them. She keeps blaming my dad for her addiction and the reason why she?s smoking again, but he?s a great man and father and would never try to hurt her. She?s become so grouchy and distant from the whole family and I can tell it?s eating away at her. We went on a vacation and she was mixing them with alcohol. We just got back yesterday. My dad says there?s nothing he can do.. it?s weighing on him hard. He tries to help her but she keeps throwing shit in his face and cursing him out saying she wants a divorce. They?re both hurting. I don?t want to see my family be torn apart like this. I?m turning 22 next month. My dad says since she opened up to me about it,(she won?t talk to him about it) I?m the one who has the chance to help her quit. I?m so scared that one day she?s going to take too many.

"Little back story... when we met he was my dealer. I was a coke user (or most anything really), he supplied. He made me feel safe, comforted. Something i never had. We used together, tried crack here and there, but never like whats happening now.

Fast forward years later, we got married and have a child. When i found out i was pregnant, i got sober off all substances immediately. He struggled. He would disappear for days on benders, but i was always here wanting him to come home. We fought but then again i was once him. I did coke daily, i drank like a fish. We were one in the same.

Things are different now. We have a child, i am a mother and she is my purpose and drive day to day. Somewhere along the line he started smoking crack daily. If he isnt high, hes asleep. If hes awake hes manic and paranoid or nasty. Cant hold a job, finances are on me. Taking care of our child is on me. Our home, our pets, i am now alone but living with an empty shell of a person. He Refuses rehab, quit IOP multiple times. What am i to do? Why cant he just stop like i did? Why am i the outlier of drug addiction that i turned the other cheek and never looked back on the life i lived?

I've been smoking nicotine for 10 years. Quit cigarettes, went to vaping for a couple of years. Finally weened off vaping with nicotine lozenges. Rocked that out for 4 months(my longest inhaling quit time ever).

That brings us to today. Life happened, I got stressed, I broke down and bought a vape and 0mg (no nicotine) vape juice. What is baffling to me is that I haven't used a nicotine lozenge all day since buying the vape.

"Fellow addict here. I?ve (18F) been smoking for years now and while I never really wanted to quit before, I?ve been practicing self-improvement lately and figured it would be best for me to do so in order to live a longer more fulfilling life. Not just for me, but for my loved ones as well.

Main downside is, a lot of my loved ones smoke as well. My older sister is the one that got me started, and me and my brother and best friend (who is also like a sister to me) have all smoked together since early high school. This includes cannabis and nicotine.

Thinking about it now, I can?t understand why we thought it was okay to start so young. We all had our issues, yes, and still do, but it should be a no-brainer that smoking does more damage than repair, right?

I worry sometimes that because I?ve integrated it into my life from such an early age, it will be nearly impossible to quit. Especially because they don?t even want to. The only one who really supports me is my boyfriend who I plan on moving away with soon.

I thought moving away and just getting far from it all for a while would help towards me quitting significantly, but lately I?m having doubts. Has anybody else on here quit both vaping and smoking weed before? The green isn?t as hard, but vaping seems nearly impossible as this point. Especially compared to what many have told me about their failed attempts before. If you have been able to, what was your process? Any advice or tips are seriously appreciated!",Addiction

Can?t afford it and for many months I?ve been taking strong opiates daily. It seriously helps the tooth pain and I just decided it would be a temporary thing until I could save the money to fix them.

"I'm moving in with a friend for may 1st. She's been in AA and recovery for about a year and a half, during Christmas time she relapsed twice back to back and was back on the AA/NA bandwagon. So she's been 90 days clean now. I'm forever happy and proud of her. But I have some concerns.

I'm moving in in May, my parents will be helping out for her half of the rent till she moves in for July. Lately although I truly appreciate her honesty, a lot of things she's opened up about has given me some concerns. She's asked to not be on the lease for the first few months which is okay as she won't be living there. So I said we can put you on the lease when you move in. And she said yeah we can look back at it for when that time comes. She's opened up that she doesn't know if she can pay the damage deposit right off the hop because she can't afford it due to not having an income. So I said you'll have to speak to your parents about that because I can't cover that. And on top of all this stress and anxiety for her she's having bad withdrawals every other week.

I don't want to criticize how she's handling life right now. That's not my place and I understand that helping her for my benefit is not the way to go. But as much of a best friend she is I feel I still need to be realistic. I think living in a home together guaranteed with no alcohol or drugs around would be great for the both of us. But I need reassurance that she will pull her weight equally. And to atleast show that she's trying to better help her financial situation. This all being said my fear is that if she's already close to another relapse line, saying these things will push her over they edge. I need some advice to have these conversations because although I've gone through addiction myself, in my story it was a lot easier to pull myself out of it compared to.

"I?m 21 years old and I have been smoking on a regular basis for about 4 years. Basically I went from smoking every couple weeks to days to every couple hours. It has put me in many bad situations where I was in danger and it?s mostly made me very unproductive and depressed about my lack of productivity. Basically my grades went from good to mediocre and I eventually took a break from school because of other life events. I eventually had to stop smoking because I moved to Europe against my will and had to stop cold turkey. I started school again and was doing actually good for once which had not been the case in the past three years ever since I started smoking heavily. Then... I found weed here in Europe and I smoked for the first time since a month of not smoking and it has set me backwards so much. I haven?t been able to be productive for the whole week. I don?t want to continue smoking because now I have so much work and an exam I am not ready for whatsoever and I kind hate myself for having gotten weed because I was doing better without it. I don?t even know how to not smoke when I have weed available. Today I?m going to try not smoking at all and finishing my assignments and exams but I just am tired of this weed problem. In a way the fact that this weed is an Indica might have to do with it but I don?t have any dark as available and either way I just feel like weed has taken a part of me and held me back and I want to quit but it?s hard especially because weed receives so much positivity online and people keep screaming that you can?t be addicted to weed however studies show otherwise. Yesterday I said to myself I won?t smoke and I?ll do my work but then I smoked like three hits and that was enough to hold me back from getting any work done and just made me eat and the. fall asleep. I?m starting to hate this so much. I want to be productive and I might have to just throw my weed away in the trash until the semester ends. And for everyone saying it?s just because of my personality not weed, then how do u explain I can only be successful at school when I?m not high? Anyway I just wanted people to talk to me about this and if u had the same problem and overcame it please let me know how I can too.",Addiction
"After a five year struggle with diphenhydramine, I finally kicked the habit... But that seems like it's only the start of the battle.. how far fucked am I ? This thought consumes me, a question I find myself asking everyday to no avail. Im not going to lie I am terrified, I have more Gastro issues then I do with congnitive ability and memory recall, but I can clearly tell at the very least my recall has been affected. I know what they say, ""you did it to yourself"" or ""you knew what you were doing and what the consequences were"" but I was so lost in it I was completely oblivious to the damage I was causing. I guess I may be doomed to spend the rest of my existence convinced Im going to develope dementia. I don't know if it's a 100% guarantee or not but from the info available it seems that I'm screwed. I can't even find any info on what to do now to try and heal.

I?ve been doing roxy presses for a while. I started taking them and was thinking that they didn?t feel like roxy but now I?m here still snorting it every day and night and whenever I can. I need help with WD and what I might need to lessen the pain. I don?t have a lot of options. I have no way to get subs or go to any clinics/rehabs. Everyone is leaving my life and I just want to give up. I can?t because my mother wouldn?t be able to handle it. I?m stuck. I?m either going to keep using or it needs to stop now before I go to heroin. I could never imagine myself doing it but my brain is slowly thinking it?s not as bad of an idea and that alone is scaring me. I have no financial stability to keep feeding my addiction. I?ve been crying for days on end because it?s tearing me apart. I don?t know where to start with quitting. WD scares me more than almost anything. I?ve been through so many different types of WD from different drugs. But this is going to be my hardest. I just wish I had someone to help me through this. If I had a shoulder to cry on I would probably have less of a chance of attempting a spur of the moment OD or relapse. But there?s nobody. I?m alone in this and I want my life back. I want healthy relationships. I want love. All of this started because I felt lonely and wanted to cover that hole. And now it?s making me unlovable on top of making me want love more. Not even love at this point. Just emotional support. Someone please just tell me how to tackle this hell before it?s too late. I?m only 18 years old,Addiction
"OK. So I've been going through some things here recently. I hope and pray that I am able to fully articulate my struggle and explain my reasoning behind everything going on and why I did what I felt best.

I'll start by saying I was 2 years sober when the pandemic started. Covid cost me 2 jobs, a house, and a relationship. I was starting to crack at the seams and on April 29th, it happened. Trump gave me my stimulus on the worst day of the year. I don't blame Trump, or the extra influx of money into my account. I blame myself and a lack of accountability. But I relapsed. I spent 3 weeks in hell and caught a case. I bonded out and got myself together.

However that did not last long, a few months later I relapsed again. Spent another few weeks in hell and got myself together before getting into trouble. All the while I wasn't really in contact with my sponsor or anyone from recovery.

But this time different, I decided to reach out. I decided to ask for help. And help is what I thought I got. I moved into sober living, was going to meetings and doing the steps all over again. Life was great! Or so it seemed.

Then I started to notice how judgemental a Nast majority of the recovery community in my city was. It was like being in catholic church again. Do this or goto hell. Do this or die. Do this and God hates you! So I chose to keep my head down and my circle small. But somehow the judgemental cesspool which is the indy recovery scene just seemed to seep its way in. The you're not part of the ""cool"" kids table really started to show thru. Everytime I reached out, everywhere I turned I saw fake hope and people lying. People judging and people ultimately hating on myself or others who seemed to be doing good.

Anyways fast forward a few months and I made the ultimate decision to remove myself entirely from the recovery community. It's not that I want to smoke dope. I don't. It's not that I want to be a waste of life and die a lonely man. I don't. But I don't want to surround myself with that hatred, the lack of real empathy for another's struggles. And the people who were ""in crowders"" or cool kids as I call them looking down on everyone and making me feel bad for anything.

I deleted 90%of my recovery related friends. Removed myself from all the local recovery groups on fb, and have basically isolated myself to a small group of family and friends. Am I setting myself up for a relapse? Have I done what I always do and convinced myself of lies? Or is it possible that I'm right and the recovery community not helping in ways I thought were ""why we do it"" the reasons for my relapses?

Again idk if I'm articulating my struggles or giving a fully accurate time line of events bc this is all off the top of my head. But any advice would be much appreciated! Much love and respect!",Addiction

"Over a year ago, I decided to stop taking amphetamines. I was really really bad into it for a good three years. A lot of people say you can?t be bad into amphetamines but I was super duper bad into it. It was ruining my life and ruining my body. It was something I stopped doing without any rehab or meetings. I stopped shortly after my father dying. I just started going to therapy and told my therapist I was an addict and I needed to stop and so I just stopped. But since then, I haven?t had much guidance otherwise. My therapist hasn?t been much help. I?ve stayed away from the drug itself, but I smoke weed periodically. Otherwise, I?m also a recovering alcoholic, and I take naltrexone to keep it that way. I haven?t drank in over a year, either. After coming off amphetamines I fell right into alcoholism. Which I never expected either.

But here?s my question: I ask myself sometimes, why did I get into amphetamines? What was it about that drug in particular? When I was on amphetamines I never had a drinking problem. I actually hated drinking.

Also, Why do I drink so much coffee everyday, now? Why do I smoke so much nicotine? And is it possible that these things are just as bad as the amphetamines?

Prior to the addiction, I was 17, and I had no prior substance abuse issues. And now I?m so reliant upon stimulants at the age of 24. And I want to drink every single day. My body literally craves alcohol.

What happened to me? Is there a reason my brain is so reliant upon stimulants? Is this part of being an addict? Will my brain always be addicted to stimulants or will it be better if I stop smoking nicotine and drinking caffeine? How does the brain of an addict work?

I?m really sorry if I sound ridiculous. I want to be more aware of myself. I just want to understand myself. And I don?t have much guidance right now. I feel like this is sort of the only place I can go with my questions. I really appreciate your time.",Addiction

He's hesitant to go to something like AA because he's in his late 20's and wants to find a group that feels relatable. He also isn't very interested in the religious aspect of traditional 12 step programs. I guess I'll just come out and say it, if there's an astrology based group please do share...

"I need real life information, not ?signs your teen is doing meth? google search results, haha.

My question is would an addict use different drugs for different times, or would they use the same drug all the time? Like meth in the AM and H or opioids to go to sleep or around family? Is it about whatever they can get their hands on?

My little sister and her husband were found by the cops passed out on the side of the road near a gas station or something. Cops said they had meth in a baggie, track marks on their arms, and crushed cans. The husband?s parents do heroin, and my sister has had history with both and is overall an addict. But being passed out and not showing a lot of signs of being ?tweaky? around the family is weird. She?s always been addicted to Xanax and opioids. Meth came into the picture a few years back, and I guess heroine too. She has a kid now, about 2, and my family is just in shock and have no idea how to handle this and how far it?s gone.",Addiction
"So this might be the wrong place, a bad question or even horribly stupid. I am 40m - frequent social drinker (1-2 times a weeks) and occasional social drug user (edibles, mushrooms seldom, and the occasional bump/party night aka coke). I imagine I?m not the only one, but COVID has changed things fairly drastically. I am immunodeficient so I have been self isolating since feb/March (almost a year holy crap). I have been diagnosed with anxiety and depression for about 4 years - which I am on meds (but have been struggling to take on a regular basis, I have no idea why...) I now realize before diagnosis I was self medicating just to be around people and ?drown my sorrows?. I have 4 people in my bubble that I see maybe once a month. None of these are meant to be excuses or looking for sympathy - I?m just trying to give a little back ground.

Recently my drug and alcohol use has increased significantly. I get high off edibles sometimes 3 times in a week. I drink to get drunk (I have no social life anymore) typically 3 times a week. And I now use - much more than before - coke every time I drink. Somethings all 3 in the same night. By myself. And each are being increased because I?m trying to escape that voice in my head, the depression, the anxiety, the loneliness. There?s usually at least a day in between these nights. During the hangover days I get down. To the point where I want to kill myself (lately getting worse). I self loath, and hide from the world. I don?t work my regular hours. (Lucky enough to be able to work from home - and always get my work done but often after hours). I tell myself I need to change. And I?m going to change. But then a day later - I catch up on work and feel better and then decide to have a drink and then I get high and the cycle repeats.

Does anyone have any advice on how to cut back? I want to be a casual drinker/user again. I know most people would say that there is no ?safe? amount of using. But I just want things to be back to how they were. (Covid is a long way from being over I understand). I don?t care to do drugs unless I am drinking. Never once even tried it. But I am I delusional to think that I can go back to being casual? Do I need to stop drinking and using? Is it bad that I don?t want to? Typically once or twice a year I will take a month or two off without any issue - to focus on health (get the ol ?beach bod? back) or if I have a large project for work. No major cravings per se - but I also isolate myself from the social situations that would involve drinks. I get fomo from it but no actual cravings for the booze or drugs.

I?m terrified of people finding out. I am scared of what I would do if they did. I would try rehab if I could do it without anyone knowing. But ultimately I have it in my head that I don?t want to fully stop. Most of my best memories are a result of drinks and using with friends and family (most don?t use - most don?t know I do either, I?m fairly aloof). My relationship with my Dad is largely based on our love for wine. (Wineries, tastings, sharing discoveries)

Has anyone been able to cut back? If so, Any tips? Or am I stupid and just need to cut all this crap for good?

I won?t be offended by any opinions or insights. This is a newly created account because - as I mentioned - I?m terrified of people finding out. And somehow still want to hide it from the random internet people who don?t even know me - it?s pathetic I know.

"Long post warning So I've been sober about 2 or 3 months from cocaine, and currently I am drunk/stoned and am having strong cravings. Partially because of a coke dream I had recently and partially because I am having anxiety about my partner currently using. We used to use together but made an agreement to get clean, and there have been slip ups where he has used without telling me. Now the tricky part is that my cravings are not exactly an impulse type thing, where I text my hookup and can use immediately, but ones where I'm mapping out ways that I can use discretely, thinking about where and when I can use without my partner knowing because if I find out my suspicions are true I...almost want to even the score? I feel as those I want to use so much that I'm looking for a reason to use, the reason being my partner using without me, or that there is coke in the house. To be specific about right now, my first set of intuitions have basically been debunked by my partner, but the one that's driving me crazy is a POTENTIALLY missing plate, let me say potentially again because I don't even know if it's missing or if it's non-existent, that's how severe my anxiety is on this night. And I really want to believe him telling me I'm crazy, that he isn't using right now and I have nothing to worry about. And yet my anxious brain and addict brain have merged to make me want to not believe him in hopes that I can have even just one measly bump to feel that stupid evil rush again. Fuck cocaine and fuck my mind I'm just so done. Someone tell me it gets easier, even if I know that it does, I just need to hear it.",Addiction
"Not to sound whiny, I just feel pathetic. I?m 18 and I can tell I?m struggling with a caffeine addiction. First a few things I really should have thought of, the main one being caffeine /can/ really be a serious addiction and have horrible withdrawals. Secondly, I have to say addiction runs in my family, along with having MDD and BPD, which I?ve been told often lead people to abuse drugs and/or alcohol. I?ve already been to crisis units and I?ve been taking meds for years, having them changed with dosages and medication prescriptions, and nothing seems to work. The reason I bring that up is because my mental health has never gotten better, so I?ve been trying to find something to easily access and lose myself a bit. I don?t know why I didn?t even think about how bad it is to drink so much caffeine in a day. I?m fully aware of how bad it is, I drink around 2,800 mg a week and I just feel disgusting. If I don?t have caffeine within one or two days I experience horrible withdrawals and I go to school which makes it worse when I?m trembling so much and my focus and anxiety are worsened. I?ve tried to stop drinking so much but I legitimately can?t because of withdrawals. My parents don?t know and they never have really cared too much about either my mental or physical health, so I absolutely know they wouldn?t take into account how serious this might be.

The advice I really need right now is how to force myself to not drink so much, or maybe how to just drink less. I?ve tried but when withdrawals hit it gets so bad and I?m scared I?ll get really sick. I?ve seen my dad go through alcohol and drug withdrawals in the past, with convulsions and seizures and vomiting and I don?t want that. If anyone has advice on how I can help myself with this please let me know.",Addiction

I have talked to my doctor and she is trying to add Paxil to my list of meds and after review, I don?t want it.

Ever since I was a child I was surrounded by people who used a variety of intoxicants, and due to that, among my own habits (I used to smoke Marijuana), I could tell immediately it wasn't a Water Pipe for Marijuana Flower, but it was an oil burner pipe, commonly used in the practice of smoking Methamphetamines, or Crack Cocaine. However, I am conflicted as whether to confront him or not, as I do not want the police involved, and I only saw his girlfriend doing it at the time, he was asleep.

"This isn't anywhere near as bad as some of the people on here and I feel so stupid and overdramatic for even having to come on here but I just need to vent and I need advice. Ever since my first cone I haven't had a month sober, I started smoking November 2017 and ever since April 2018 it's been almost everyday with the occasional 1 or 2 week brake where I've tried to quit. I've wanted to quit ever since August 2018 but haven't done more than two weeks since then.

"First day without smoking anything since 2017 and I?m struggling a lot. It?s my day off work and It?s going by so slowly!

I started smoking at a time where I was severely depressed anxious and overweight and it has helped me amazingly. I have lost 30 kgs. I am so much more of a confident person however what it has turned into is an addiction and I think I?m so anxious that if i quit I?ll end up how I was before I started smoking back in 2017.

I find that because I have integrated it into everything I do on a daily basis I find it hard to do anything without it. I can?t even distract myself with friends. I have one friend who is a stoner as well that?s it.",Addiction

Sometimes recovery is looking your spouse dead in the eyes with righteousness while you pee in a cup because you know you?ve been clean for months and then crying in private because you know their reasoning for question you is valid and this won?t be the last time you do this...,Addiction
"I (37M) have been drinking alcohol and smoking weed recreationally since I was 14. I have been with my spouse (37F) for 20 years and we have been married for 10. We have two children (4F and 1M). I am a devoted husband and father, but over the years there have been trust issues with my substance abuse and my lying about it. I have promised change and backslid repeatedly. Recently, I have taken to smoking weed after my wife and kids have gone to bed so I can hide it.

Recently we have entered a care relationship with five other families of young children and a teacher who are operating a preschool pod in our home. My wife and I are working at home now. It has been my responsibility to cover the teacher's lunch break. Today I made a stupid choice that I was going to take a hit during the work day and my wife walked in on me. I was taking a hit out the window in my daughter's bedroom.",Addiction

"I?m dating a recovering meth addict. I have no experience of substance abuse and/or addiction apart from vaping and consuming obscene quantities of coffee. I want to be as supportive and helpful to him as I can.

In the beginning of our relationship I could sense that there was something he wasn?t telling me about himself so I just kinda laid all my vulnerability on the table and told him the deal breaker for me would be dishonesty and a lack of communication.

He then seemed really scared, but told me about his addiction and a recent (about two months ago) relapse.

He has, since then, opened up so much more.",Addiction
"I interview Matt on Them, That and This about his addiction to pornography. He talks about first jerks, six-hour Pornhub sessions, the kind of porn he loved, and the toll it took on his relationships and life. As of today, porn's grasp on Matt has loosened significantly, but the looming threat is always there. This is how he's learned to fight his urges.",Addiction
"i started dating my boyfriend once he left rehab for the 3rd time. i was still using for a couple weeks but i stopped because i felt that i was only making matters worse by doing so, even though he said he was okay with it. (i am now 3 months clean,) but what can i do to support him whenever he gets a craving, or if one day, (god forbid) he starts talking about using again? or if he relapses? (once again, GOD FORBID)... i?ve never dealt with this kind of situation before so i?m fairly new to it all, & the driving force behind making this post is really just ?what if?s? & paranoia. but i really just want to know what to do and/or say whenever he shares something that i don?t know how to respond to. i want to be there for him, i just don?t know how",Addiction
"My husband is a recovering alcoholic who now switched to tussin and weed. I dont mind weed as much as I do tussin. He takes so much of it to basically be non functional. When confronted doesn't see a problem. We've been through this before with alcohol and it smells the same. If he does realize he needs to stop it, I wont help. Does anyone have tussin stories, ways to ocmver come it and what could happen if one chooses to continue, healthwise. Thanks anyone who could shed some light.",Addiction
"I?m 24f and started smoking when I was around 20. My life before smoking was miserable - I?m from not so healthy nor loving working class family, never really had friends or a boyfriend, no skills, hobbies or passions... the only thing that kept me going before was education - the only thing I was good at and gave me satisfaction (not even necessary studying itself, it was more about the results and feedback I received that made me happy). Additionally, I?ve always struggled with my mental health and went through some therapies but nothing really has ever helped.

When I started to smoke at university it was amazing. Everything was just fun and I felt happy. Of course, eventually I tried other drugs - these were the only times when I truly had fun. I?ve also met friends who were also into weed and other drugs. Eventually some of them quit and got better lives and others moved away and we are no longer in touch.",Addiction

"So I've been fighting this urge I have every morning when I wake up to go outside right away and smoke. I'm trying to go without, the longer I go without does it get better? Does it get easier? I know some people think you can't be addicted to marijuana but I used to be a heroin addict 5 years ago. And I was addicted to pills up until about a 2 years ago. Now smoking pot is a substitute I've been using. But I need to stop it makes me lazy and eat. And I don't know how safe the dab oils are since they're not regulated here. Has anyone else quit smoking pot and can you tell me a little bit of your story? It's been so difficult to quit.",Addiction
"Gf relapsed
My girlfriend relapsed. She keeps telling me to give up and so does everyone else. She says she?s tired of seeing me hurt and she loves me. She got addicted to the stuff between a couple year break up. The thing is I love her and don?t want to give up but it?s killing me inside. But if I give up I?m the last person fighting for her. She has severe ptsd on top of bipolar. She was just clean for 2 months. Should I just give up or keep trying to get her to come home?",Addiction
